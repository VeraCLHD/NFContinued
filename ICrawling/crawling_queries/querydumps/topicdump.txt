T-3	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/	abdominal aortic aneurysm	Abdominal aortic aneurysms are ballooning bulges in the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lower extremities. Stiffening, inflammation and calcification with oxidized cholesterol cause the blood vessel walls to loose their ability to appropriately stretch and recoil as pressurized blood flows along the artery with each heart beat. The increased pressure within the vessel may cause the weakened walls to bulge and, in some cases, rupture.Unfortunately, rupture of an aortic aneurysm is often the first presented symptom and is often fatal. Male smokers over 65 are at the highest risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Quitting smoking is the best way to prevent an aneurysm from forming, but changes in diet, such as minimizing or eliminating meat consumption, eating nuts daily and increasing fruit and vegetable intake may also be helpful in prevention of aortic aneurysms.	-	mortality,smoking,saturated fat,cholesterol,cardiovascular disease,aneurysm,aorta,men's health,vegetables,vegetarians,meat,Albert Einstein,fast food,fruit,nuts	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/27/aortic-aneurysm-prevention-jeff-green-and-his-aorta/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-help-prevent-abdominal-aortic-aneurysms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/abdominal-aortic-aneurysms-ticking-time-balloons/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/	
T-4	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/abdominal-fat/	abdominal fat	Abdominal fat, or the fat around our organs, increases our risk of premature death. Abdominal fat has been linked to meat (of any kind), egg, and milk consumption. Poultry consumption, in particular, appears linked to an expanding waist circumference. Meat may decrease levels of adiponectin, a hormone which may help protect from cellulite. Processed sugary and fatty foods are low nutrient, high calorie and may have addictive properties. Even artificial sweeteners may cause weight gain. Obesity can start in adolescence. Boys who eat more meat in childhood may be more likely to develop abdominal fat streaks, putting them at greater risk for heart disease.On the other hand, plant foods may have slimming effects (as with beans such as soy, and nuts) and enhance abdominal fat loss from exercise (as with green tea), though some plant foods, such as grapefruit, have just as much effect on weight loss as water. Flavonoid phytonutrients (found concentrated in citrus, berries, red onions, beans, green tea, grapes, and cocoa) may boost metabolism enough to significantly slim one’s waistline.Nuts, too, may help achieve a slimmer waist, less weight gain, and lower one’s risk of obesity by boosting our metabolism, satiating our appetites, and may have less calories than previously thought because of fecal fat loss. Nuts may also prevent death by lengthening our lifespans and reducing our cancer risk. Dried fruit has similar effects. Eating legumes helps to reduce belly fat, which lowers one’s risk for metabolic syndrome, a type of prediabetes. Although weight loss can be achieved through a variety of diets, blood flow is better in people who eat plant-based diets as compared to low-carb diets.Obesity can lead to other health problems, including a decrease in one’s ability to feel pleasure. When abdominal obesity, high fasting sugars, high triglycerides, and high cholesterol are all present in the same individual, this is referred to as “metabolic syndrome.” Losing an extra few pounds of belly fat may be the best way to prevent prediabetes and protect babies during pregnancy, since pollutants may be stored in fat cells.	-	weight loss,fat,obesity,heart disease,heart health,body

T-15	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/acidbase-balance/	acid/base balance	Acid/base balance, in terms of human health, refers to the biological homeostasis or balancing of acidic and basic (alkaline) activities in the body. pH is a measure of acidity and alkalinity: higher pH means more basic/alkaline and lower pH means more acidic.Ancestral human diets may have been largely plant-based, with consumption of animal products being rare and intermittent, making those diets more basic/alkalizing than is the typically acid producing Western diet (standard American diet—SAD) of today.The balance of acid/base-inducing foods determines the “dietary acid load” (DAL). Acid-inducing diets are rich in animal proteins; base-inducing diets are more plant-based and are high in the most alkalizing foods, fruits and vegetables. Beans are also significantly alkaline-forming.Meat, eggs, and dairy are comprised proteins that contain acid forming sulfur. Plant foods contain less sulfur, making them more alkalizing. The acid or base-producing characteristic of dietary protein choice seems to be a more important determinant of the progression of kidney disease (and the formation of kidney stones) than the amount of protein ingested.Too much acid load may cause damage to the delicate urine-making tubes in the kidneys via increased ammonia production. Kidneys create ammonia (a base) to buffer the acidity from the food we eat. This gets rid of the acid, but over time the extra ammonia in the kidneys can have toxic effects. The idea that kidney function tends to decline progressively as we age may be a result of damage induced by years of ammonia overproduction, not aging itself. The acidic pH may also increase the production of free radicals, which damage the kidneys.Under normal circumstances, a vegetarian diet is alkalizing and a non-vegetarian diet is acid producing. Comparing kidney function, the people who have the most plant-based diet were associated with less kidney decline. A vegan diet appeared more beneficial than vegetarian, and vegetarian better than meat containing diets. Apparently, the fewer animal products, the better!But meat or plants are not the only dietary choices that affect acid/alkaline balance. More refined grains and less fiber–such as eating white flour and white rice–is also associated with higher acidity. Vegetarian diets containing whole grains and beans also create healthy alkalinity. This higher fiber, less acidic diet also bodes well for those hoping to avoid bowel and colorectal cancer.Alkalization of the urine is effective for removing uric acid from the body, and a plant-based diet does just that—this is good news for those wanting to reduce the risk of fatal stroke, heart disease, and death.Wasting muscle mass appears to be an adaptive response to chronic low-level diet-determined acidosis. Preserving muscle mass may be as easy as eating your fruits and veggies and eschewing the standard American diet.	-	vegetarians,plant-based diets,vegans,fruit,vegetables,meat,animal protein,animal products,kidney health,protein,kidney disease,fish,cholesterol,eggs,standard American diet	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/31/does-animal-protein-cause-osteoporosis/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increasing-protein-intake-age-65/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-chronic-kidney-disease-with-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-kombucha-tea-goodfor-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-kidney-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-source-an-acid-test-for-kidney-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-protein-bad-to-the-bone/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-water-a-scam/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bowel-movements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/acidbase-balance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/standard-american-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oxidative-stress/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sulfur/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ammonia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alkaline-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ph/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-stones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality	
T-16	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/acne/	acne	Humans are the only species that are exposed to the kind of external hormonal manipulation associated with dairy consumption, and the consumption of cow’s milk by humans may interfere with the body’s sensitive endocrine regulatory network.In some parts of the world, like the United States, acne is a prevalent skin disease that affects 85% of teenagers, some into their third decade of life.There appears to be a connection between milk consumption and acne. For example, it’s been shown that a dairy-free diet may improve acne vulgaris. Also, the Harvard Nurses’ Study found an association between high school dairy intake and severe, physician-diagnosed acne.Dairy may be considered a major cause of the acne epidemic in the Western world. Three Harvard studies linked acne and dairy consumption in adolescence with the sex steroid hormone content naturally found in cow’s milk (even without added hormones). The highest levels of hormones were found in skim milk.  The hormones found in dairy may also upset our body’s hormonal balance. This may also explain why women eating a conventional diet are five times more likely to give birth to twins than those eating plant-based diets.Milk may represent a sophisticated hormone signaling system that activates the enzyme known as TOR, which has been identified as a leading driver in a range of chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and cancers of the breast and prostate. Cow’s milk has three times more leucine, the primary activator of TOR, so dairy consumption could lead to over-stimulation of TOR in humans.Organic milk contains the same hormones as full-fat dairy.One study of the effect of barberry, a high antioxidant fruit, on acne, showed that teens with moderate to severe acne who ate about a teaspoon of dried barberries three times daily experienced a 43% reduction in zits.  	-	dairy,milk,cancer,hormones,skin health,women's health,adolescence,breast cancer,estrogen,chronic diseases,brain health,Alzheimer’s disease,brain disease,skim milk,animal products	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/12/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/07/the-dietary-link-between-acne-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hormones-in-skim-vs-whole-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-acne-barberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-hormonal-interference/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-acne-promoting-effects-of-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acne-cancer-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-acne-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saving-lives-by-treating-acne-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/national-dairy-council-on-acne-and-milk/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/adolescence,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/skim-milk,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/twins,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Alzheimer%E2%80%99s-disease

Additionally, pregnant women are advised to avoid all deep-fried carbohydrates due to the effects of acrylamide on neural development.	-	cancer,french fries,carcinogens,frying,potato chips,Europe,endometrial cancer,breast cancer,inflammation,safety limits,women's health,kidney cancer,sweet potatoes,ovarian cancer,infants	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/24/is-it-better-to-bake-boil-or-steam-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/26/breast-cancer-and-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endometrial-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/neurotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/frying/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ovarian-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tobacco/	
T-25	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/adolescence/	adolescence	Hormones define adolescence; disruption of hormone signalling by pollutants found in meat may be causing early onset of puberty, which may be linked to cancer and mortality. Breast cancer risk, however, seems to drop with increased intake of soy, green tea, mushrooms, and nuts during adolescence. Even though it often doesn’t show itself clinically until later in life, atherosclerosis, leading to stroke, heart disease, and possibly even chronic low back pain, may begin in adolescence. One of the scourges of being a teenager, acne, seems to be linked to dairy consumption, possibly due to the high hormone content of milk. This may present a great disease prevention opportunity by getting youth to eat healthier under the guise of treating their acne with diet. Adolescent behavior may also be related to consumption of green leafy vegetables and mothers’ fish consumption while pregnant. Soda consumption may lead to hyperactivity. Adolescents who drink milk do appear to have a higher bone density, but this soon reverses.	-	children,milk,women's health,dairy,men's health,bread,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,cancer,hormones,berries,vegetables,vegetarians,puberty,plant-based diets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/15/stopping-heart-disease-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/11/preventing-and-treating-low-back-pain-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/31/why-is-milk-consumption-associated-with-more-bone-fractures/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/16/how-milk-may-contribute-to-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/07/the-dietary-link-between-acne-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/14/how-much-fiber-should-you-eat-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/04/how-seafood-can-impact-brain-development/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/melatonin-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-best-lowers-phthalate-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-acne-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saving-lives-by-treating-acne-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-a-stroke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-in-circulation-sciatica-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-good-for-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/national-dairy-council-on-acne-and-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-consumption-and-the-development-of-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/music-for-anxiety-mozart-vs-metal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-acne-promoting-effects-of-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-hyperactivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-might-vegetarians-have-less-hpv/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/formula-for-childhood-obesity/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soda,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-acne-promoting-effects-of-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-hyperactivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-acne-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saving-lives-by-treating-acne-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-a-stroke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-in-circulation-sciatica-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-good-for-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industrial-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty/

T-28	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/adventist-health-studies/	Adventist Health Studies	The ground-breaking Adventist Health Study (AHS-2) explores the links between lifestyle, diet and disease among Seventh-day Adventists, most of whom follow unique dietary habits. More than 96,000 church members from the U.S. and Canada are participating in the current study led by researchers at Loma Linda University. Two earlier studies of California Adventists were conducted during the past 40 years.One Adventist study looked at people following a range of diets:Results showed that eating a plant-based diet incrementally lowered one’s risk of high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes.Studies also found that eating brown rice, cooked green vegetables, beans (including chickpeas, split peas, lentils), and dried fruit was associated with decreased risk of colorectal polyps. In the U.S., colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death, but in some parts of the world, like Uganda, it is nearly non-existent.In the AHS-2 study, the largest of its kind, researchers sought to determine whether a plant-based diet was protective against diabetes. They noted as much as a 78% lower prevalence of diabetes among those eating a strictly plant-based diet. Protection accrued incrementally as people transitioned from eating meat to eating less meat or just fish and then no meat, and then finally to eating no meat, eggs or dairy.The Adventist diet compares favorably to the traditional Okinawan diet, which consists of less than 1% each of fish, meat, dairy and eggs. The long-lived Okinawans’ highly anti-inflammatory diet was 96% plant-based, yet the Adventist vegetarians in California, with a 100% meat-free diet, enjoy an even higher life expectancy of 87 for men and nearly 90 for women when they abstain from smoking and exercise regularly. This is 10 to 14 years longer than the life expectancy of the general population.	-	vegetables,heart disease,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart health,vegetarians,plant-based diets,vegans,cancer,eggs,meat,lifestyle medicine,fruit,smoking,fish	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/27/dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/18/why-do-vegan-women-have-fewer-female-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-macular-degeneration-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-sex-hormone-binding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-eating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/metabolic-syndrome-and-plant-based-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/uganda,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/okinawan-diet/	
T-30	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/africa/	Africa	Dr. Dennis Burkitt’s landmark study in the 1950’s  on the traditional African diet concluded that many chronic diseases in modern Western culture “are universally rare in third world countries.” He confirmed that in the African population of Uganda the rate of heart disease was almost non-existent. Studies also demonstrated that another measure of cardiovascular risk, blood pressure, was also significantly reduced in rural Kenya where no cases of hypertension were found in almost 2000 patients.Although breast pain affects up to two-thirds of Western women, it is rare among African women who eat traditional plant-based diets. This diet may lower prolactin, a central factor associated with cyclic breast pain. In rural Bantu, African women have been found to have lower prolactin levels.Colon cancer was almost unheard of when studied in the 1950’s. Even now Africans eating whole-food plant based diets have 50 times less colon cancer compared to Americans eating a Western diet.The lowest rates of dementia and Alzheimer’s are found in Africa, India and south Asia. This appears to be lifestyle-related, as dementia and Alzheimer’s are five times lower for Africans in Nigeria than for African Americans in Indianapolis.Research has shown that that for those eating a plant-based diet rates of autoimmune diseases are lower. One study of rural blacks in sub-Sahara Africa found that before the diet became Westernized, not a single case of multiple sclerosis had been diagnosed among a population of 15 million.  Compared to western diets the traditional plant-based diets found in Africa create softer, larger stools (3-4 times the volume). These create less pressure on the stomach contents, reducing the reflux which can lead to hiatal hernias. White South Africans and black and white Americans have more gallstones, appendicitis, and 25 times the rates of so-called “pressure diseases.”Starchy vegetables, starchy grains and greens dominate the traditional African diet and are loaded with fiber, which has been shown to be health-promoting. Newer research is also focusing on resistant starch (which can be obtained from some low-fiber refined foods such as cornmeal porridge, a staple of modern African meals). Other research focuses on how native gut flora, minimal animal fat intake and maximum Vitamin D exposure may be related to the health advantages of the traditional plant-based African diet.Many Africans are now eating Westernized diets with resultant poorer health, prompting efforts to encourage increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains while decreasing consumption of food high in added sugar, salt and fat.  	-	fruit,vegetables,fiber,plant-based diets,chronic diseases,heart disease,cardiovascular health,heart health,grains,vegetarians,cardiovascular disease,meat,vegans,microbiome,gut flora	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/11/we-can-end-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/19/dont-forget-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/06/how-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/12/where-are-the-lowest-rates-of-alzheimers-in-the-world/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resistant-starch-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/putrefying-protein-and-toxifying-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-reverse-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lose-two-pounds-one-sitting-taking-mioscenic-route/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-the-fiber-theory-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-a-colon-cancer-mystery/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-fiber-really-prevent-diverticulosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-hiatal-hernia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-bowel-movements-should-you-have-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/would-taxing-unhealthy-foods-improve-public-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-your-gut-microbiome-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-nutrition-so-commercialized/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/getting-starch-to-take-the-path-of-most-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleopoo-what-we-can-learn-from-fossilized-feces/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/multiple-sclerosis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/hiatal-hernia,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/autoimmune-diseases,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/dementia,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-d-supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-pressure,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/appendicitis,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/gallstones,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber	
T-31	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/african-americans/	African Americans	Some of the most convincing evidence of the benefits of plant-based diets come from comparisons of traditional diets in other parts of the world to the standard American diet. Colon cancer is more than 50 times lower among native African populations than among African-Americans. Researchers believe that diet is the primary reason: African-Americans eat significantly more meat and less plant-based food than native Africans.In fact, eating a meat-heavy, low-fiber diet can cause the colon to rupture itself as it squeezes harder to move waste along. Over half of African-Americans in their 50’s were found to have diverticulosis in one study, compared to less than 1% among African-Americans eating traditional plant-based diets.Multiple myeloma is another cancer prevalent among African Americans, double or more the rate among the older white population. In one trial, the spice turmeric killed multiple myeloma cells in a petri dish, and other research suggested the spice may slow the early stage of the disease enough to delay or prevent a multiple myeloma diagnosis.Other studies suggest that consumption of shallots, garlic, soy foods and green tea may be significantly associated with a reduced risk of multiple myeloma.Numerous studies show that those following a vegetarian diet appear two to three times less likely to be diagnosed with dementia, and the longer one consumes a meat-free diet, the lower the risk of dementia. Africans in Nigeria experience a five-times lower risk of dementia than African-Americans.The rate of Alzheimer’s disease increases dramatically among Africans, as with Japanese Americans, when they live in the United States and adopt a Western diet.Glaucoma is the #1 cause of blindness among African American women. In one study, scientists found that certain fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and peaches, were associated with a dramatically lower risk. Just two or three servings of kale or collard greens a month were linked with half the risk of glaucoma compared to once a month or less.In a study of 50,000 African American women, women who ate more vegetables had significantly lower risk of the type of breast cancer hardest to treat—estrogen receptor negative. The two vegetables found to be particularly protective were collards and carrots.Several studies, including one looking specifically at African American women, have shown that drinking beet juice reduced the amount of oxygen cells need during exercise, thus improving muscle efficiency for athletes. A later study showed that eating whole beets improved running performance, allowing runners to run faster with less exertion.	-	cancer,plant-based diets,mortality,vegetables,fruit,heart disease,heart health,vegans,colon cancer,cardiovascular health,animal protein,vegetarians,eggs,cardiovascular disease,smoking	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/03/flaxseeds-for-prostate-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/putrefying-protein-and-toxifying-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-a-colon-cancer-mystery/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-mgus-and-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whole-beets-vs-juice-for-improving-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-food-using-the-tobacco-industry-playbook/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-your-gut-microbiome-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-and-benefits-of-sensible-sun-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diverticulosis-when-our-most-common-gut-disorder-hardly-existed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dementia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diverticulosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Africa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/standard-american-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/glaucoma/	
T-36	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging/	aging	Four lifestyle habits—not smoking, not being obese, 30 minutes of exercise a day, and eating plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains, but little or no meat—can turn back the clock 14 years. Of these four habits, diet may be the most important for DNA health. The more servings of fruits, vegetables and beans we consume, the longer we may live. A plant-based diet appears to help preserve muscle mass, boost immunity, repair DNA faster and slow the process of aging, meaning one can enjoy not just a longer life, but a healthier one.The enzyme known as TOR (Target of Rapamycin), which promotes cellular growth and proliferation throughout our lives, can be influenced by diet. Consuming milk and other animal products has been found to upregulate the activity of TOR and may increase the risk of a variety of cancers. Reducing animal protein consumption, on the other hand, lowers TOR activity to an extent comparable to TOR levels achieved through caloric restriction and exercise.Cooked in particular ways, poultry, pork, seafood and beef can be the most concentrated dietary sources of AGEs, or advanced glycation end products, which may accelerate the aging process. This may be the reason why meat consumption is associated with living a significantly shorter life with increased cancer mortality, heart disease mortality and overall mortality.Restricting methionine intake (largely by restricting animal products) is one strategy for extending our lives. Managing stress through activities such as meditation may reverse the aging of our DNA. Seventh-Day Adventists in California, a mostly vegetarian population, may have the highest life expectancy of any formally described population.Antioxidant pills have no apparent effect on aging, though antioxidant-rich foods may. Some foods that appear to protect against aging include: berries (for the brain, skin and eyes), grains (for protection against Alzheimer’s disease) turmeric, corn and spinach (for macular degeneration), nutritional yeast, watercress, cocoa and green and yellow vegetables (to prevent wrinkles).	-	plant-based diets,vegans,vegetarians,fruit,meat,vegetables,eggs,heart health,cardiovascular disease,elderly,heart disease,cardiovascular health,fish,dairy,beans	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/26/how-to-protect-our-telomeres-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/31/why-is-milk-consumption-associated-with-more-bone-fractures/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/01/flax-seeds-can-have-profound-effect-on-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/10/how-plant-based-diets-may-extend-our-lives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/27/how-may-eating-plants-help-prevent-alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/14/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/21/how-many-minutes-of-daily-meditation-to-combat-stress/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/08/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-help-reduce-brain-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/03/sprouted-lentils-healthier-canned-lentils/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-skin-cancer-from-the-inside-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tea-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-evidence-that-salt-raises-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-and-onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turning-the-clock-back-14-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-source-an-acid-test-for-kidney-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vitamin-d-supplements-be-taken-to-prevent-falls/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increased-lifespan-from-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-compared-cigarette-smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/longer-life-within-walking-distance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/will-you-live-longer-if-you-take-vitamin-d-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-story-of-nutritionfacts-org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension-strategy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increasing-protein-intake-age-65/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-drugs-diets-dont-lower-diabetes-deaths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruits-veggies-and-longevity-how-many-minutes-per-mouthful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-get-vitamin-d-sun-supplements-or-salons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/finger-pulse-longevity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/10/how-plant-based-diets-may-extend-our-lives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality	
T-45	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol/	alcohol	There is little doubt that heavy alcohol consumption while pregnant is harmful, but moderate alcohol consumption carries both risks and benefits. For example, alcohol consumption may decrease the risk of heart disease but increase the risk of cancer, heartburn and liver inflammation. Alcohol also increases liver disease mortality, but has a neutral effect on atrial fibrillation. The American College of Cardiology suggests limiting alcohol intake to reduce high blood pressure.Even “light” drinking increases the risk of breast cancer. One study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, reviewed results of over 100 prior studies and concluded that 5,000 breast cancer deaths annually can be attributed to light drinking. For women, breast cancer risk from alcohol is dose-dependent, meaning there may be no safe threshold.The Harvard Women’s Health Study suggests little to no risk from red wine, possibly because red grapes suppress the activity of aromatase — the enzyme used by breast tumors to produce estrogen – and counteract elevated breast cancer risk linked to alcohol intake. And de-alcoholized red wine may improve arterial function.Alcoholic beverages do not count toward one’s phytochemical index (one type of healthy eating score). And some types of mushrooms, such as morels, should never be consumed with alcohol. Strong alcoholic drinks such as wine or spirits are not considered hydrating.As for non-dietary alcohol, the smell of isopropyl and rubbing alcohol may reduce nausea and vomiting. Topic summary contributed by Wyatt.	-	vegetables,heart disease,sugar,fruit,cardiovascular disease,beverages,heart health,cardiovascular health,cancer,carcinogens,smoking,exercise,wine,weight loss,soy	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/01/improving-employee-diets-could-save-companies-millions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/27/dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/07/deep-breathing-exercise-for-nausea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/09/benefits-of-oatmeal-for-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/23/role-caffeine-artery-function/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resveratrol-impairs-exercise-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/worth-switching-white-rice-brown/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-skin-cancer-from-the-inside-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-raisins-cause-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vinegar-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-miso-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-explains-the-french-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-and-benefits-of-sensible-sun-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-palatability-of-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-doctors-responded-to-being-named-a-leading-killer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slowing-metabolism-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-aspartame-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-most-potent-phytoestrogen-is-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthy-food-movement-strength-in-unity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-alcohol-what-much-is-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-vinegar-help-with-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-sugar-takes-on-the-world-health-organization/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/wine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beverages,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mushrooms,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy	
T-47	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/algae/	algae	Algae based DHA has been found to be bio-equivalent to DHA in fish oil and seems to provide the same benefits without the contaminants (even in distilled fish oil and fish oil supplements for children), which are present in even organic farmed salmon. Blue green algae and spirulina supplements have been found to contain neurotoxins and hepatotoxins. The algae-based EPA and DHA are procured from toxin-free algae, however. Chlorella may have anti-virus effects that combat Hepatitis C. Carrageenan, from a type of red seaweed, is a food additive used as a thickener and fat substitute in a variety of dairy and nondairy products, and may cause intestinal inflammation. Pollution that causes algae blooms may increase exposure to the neurotoxin, BMAA, which may be been linked to ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease).	-	fish,supplements,infants,industrial pollutants,cancer,persistent organic pollutants,seafood,omega-3 fatty acids,exercise,mercury,brain health,safety limits,liver health,pregnancy,DHA	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/29/toxin-contamination-of-spirulina-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/16/should-we-take-chlorella-to-boost-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/06/the-best-foods-test-your-nutrition-knowledge/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/21/foods-linked-to-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/04/how-seafood-can-impact-brain-development/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-organic-salmon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gorlin-syndrome-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-hepatitis-c-with-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-athlete-immunity-with-chlorella-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-chlorella/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-spirulina-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/blue-green-algae-spirulina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/neurotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-hepatitis-c-with-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carrageenan/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-problem-with-organic-salmon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish-oil,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bmaa,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/	
T-51	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/allergies/	allergies	A plant-based diet may reduce the risk of allergies. In India, those eating the most fruit and vegetables, rather than supplements (though probiotics and prebiotics have a positive effect on the common cold), were much less likely to report asthma or other allergies. The consumption of red rice, green tea, and especially white button mushrooms may help protect against atopic (allergic) diseases. Listening to Mozart may also reduce allergic reactions.About 1 in 1,000 people may have a wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity may be on the rise, although those who suspect they are gluten intolerant, should first try to improve their diet before going on a gluten-free diet, since many who avoid gluten for symptom control end up having a different disease altogether.Components in meat that may trigger allergic reactions include antibiotics and parasitic fish worms. Seafood and meat consumption were associated with higher prevalence of asthma, pollen allergies, and eczema. There are certain meat allergies that may be triggered by the Lone Star Tick. Dairy has been linked to the recurrence of canker sores, and cow’s milk is a leading allergen.Though monosodium glutamate does not appear to trigger traditional allergic reactions, certain artificial colorings might due to the presence of cochineal, a red coloring derived from insects. Common household chemicals may also cause allergy-related diseases.There is no evidence that pregnant women consuming peanuts results in children with peanut allergies, but 1% of people do report nut allergies.	-	immune function,children,milk,cancer,weight loss,dairy,protein,mortality,women's health,fruit,autoimmune diseases,depression,antioxidants,mental health,common

T-63	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alternative-medicine/	alternative medicine	Alternative medicine involves treatments that are not traditionally taught in medical schools. These treatments may be sometimes more effective than conventional medicine. For example, one study showed that saffron was as effective as Prozac in relieving depression symptoms without sexual the dysfunction side-effects experienced by 20% of the Prozac users. Another effective alternative approach is nasal irrigation using neti pots.On the other hand, conventional medicine may sometimes be more effective than alternative medicine. A study comparing chemotherapy to a Gerson-style treatment in treating terminal pancreatic cancer patients found the chemotherapy more effective.  Some practices that were once considered alternative medicine have become a mainstream therapy. An example is probiotics, which many people use to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to treat gastroenteritis.	-	complementary medicine,surgery,medications,chemotherapy,cancer,mortality,spices,herbal remedies,women's health,pain,vitamin C,Dr. Linus Pauling,cancer survival,Mayo Clinic,weight loss	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/07/does-oatmeal-lotion-work/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/17/why-dont-more-doctors-practice-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/15/using-cherries-to-treat-gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/06/why-some-like-cilantro-and-others-hate-it/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/07/deep-breathing-exercise-for-nausea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/16/should-we-take-chlorella-to-boost-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/08/drugs-vs-lifestyle-for-preventing-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/14/can-turmeric-help-with-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/15/making-plant-based-diets-the-new-normal/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drugs-and-the-demise-of-the-rice-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-vitamin-c-in-the-treatment-of-terminal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oatmeal-lotion-for-chemotherapy-induced-rash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-oil-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/physicians-may-be-missing-their-most-important-tool/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-cilantro-gene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-vs-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/barriers-to-heart-disease-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-aromatherapy-for-nausea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/intravenous-vitamin-c-for-terminal-cancer-patients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gout-with-cherry-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-infant-colic-by-changing-moms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-and-benefits-of-neti-pot-nasal-irrigation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-hepatitis-c-with-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-nausea-menstrual-cramps-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-strengthen-the-mind-body-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-fainting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-stop-hiccups/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-c-supplements-for-terminal-cancer-patients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-acne-barberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/speeding-recovery-from-surgery-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-for-migraines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-prediabetes-from-turning-into-diabetes/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-vs-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-and-benefits-of-neti-pot-nasal-irrigation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/health-food-stores/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/homeopathy/	
T-65	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/	Alzheimer’s disease	Practically non-existent a century ago, Alzheimer’s disease is now the #6 killer in the U.S. Cardiovascular disease may contribute to clogged cerebral arteries, cutting off blood flow to the brain and leading to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Dietary components that may increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction include pork consumption, hormones and steroids in dairy, blue-green algae supplements, spirulina, copper (in meat), glycotoxins (found mostly in chicken), the neurotoxin known as BMAA, (found mostly in fish), aluminum (in cheese), and iron (in supplements).Those who eat meat such as chicken, pork and beef, as well as seafood, may have triple the risk of being diagnosed with dementia, compared to long-time vegetarians. That’s because high fat, high protein foods like these contain high levels of glycotoxins, and high levels of glycotoxins in the blood may predict cognitive decline over time.But Alzheimer’s is not an inevitable part of aging. There are certain plant foods and spices which studies indicate have the potential of preventing or slowing the disease. This includes saffron, coffee, ginger, apple juice, beans, vitamins D and B-12, whole grains and whole fruits and vegetables.Turmeric may treat and prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Just a teaspoon a day (not curcumin alone) brought dramatic improvements in the lives of several Alzheimer’s patients. Plant-based diets in general may slow aging and help prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, coconut oil has not been shown to have an effect on Alzheimer’s.Exercise has even been shown to reverse mild cognitive decline. In one study, those suffering mild cognitive impairment were directed to exercise 30 minutes a day for six months; a control group was told to simply stretch for half an hour every day. Not only did those who exercised not decline further, as the control group did, but their cognition at the end of six months was better than when they started.There may be a quick, non-invasive and affordable way to test for Alzheimer’s that involves smelling peanut butter; an early diagnosis could prove critical since research has shown that neurodegenerative brain changes may begin in middle age.	-	brain disease,brain health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,dementia,cardiovascular health,heart health,cognition,mortality,aging,Parkinson's disease,fish,cholesterol,hypertension,milk	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/17/aluminum-levels-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/26/preventing-alzheimers-disease-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/27/how-may-eating-plants-help-prevent-alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/21/foods-linked-to-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/08/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-help-reduce-brain-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/03/sprouted-lentils-healthier-canned-lentils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/12/might-turmeric-help-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/21/preventing-alzheimers-lifestyle-changes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/14/can-turmeric-help-with-alzheimers/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-lifestyle-changes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-brain-food-older-adults/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-brain-loss-with-b-vitamins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-atherosclerosis-of-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/could-lactose-explain-the-milk-and-parkinsons-disease-link/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxygenating-blood-with-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-may-start-decades-before-diagnosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-alzheimers-gene-controlling-apoe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peanut-butter-smell-test-for-alzheimers/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/peanut-butter,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cheese,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cognition	
T-68	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/american-academy-of-pediatrics/	American Academy of Pediatrics	The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is not as bold as Benjamin Spock, who wrote in his final edition of Baby and Child Care that the optimal diet for children is a vegan diet.However, we have seen childhood obesity rates exploding over the past few decades, with a particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease in overweight and obese children. So, the AAP does encourage taking advantage of opportunities to educate parents about diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle for both themselves and their kids.Per the clinical practice guidelines, children are eating too much fat and added sugars, and not enough fruits and vegetables. These unhealthy diets can have permanent consequences, with arterial plaques appearing even as early as ten years old. Perhaps this is why the AAP now recommends that all children, starting at age nine, should be screened for high cholesterol, in the hopes of finding and educating families at highest risk.The AAP warns against consumption of cow’s milk (including formula) for children at risk for type 1 diabetes. Early consumption appears to increase risk by about 50%. Per the AAP’s statement in the mid-90s (which they still support), “cow’s milk protein may indeed be an important factor in the initiation of the process that destroys your insulin-producing cells.”Of course, early consumption of cow’s milk is not recommended for any infants, with breast milk the preferred food during the first year of life, and no cow’s milk before that time.Other foods, however, can be introduced earlier. For example, since 2009, the AAP has recommended that we feed children peanuts early in life in order to reduce the long-term development of allergies. Even if a child has siblings with allergies, early consumption of peanuts can reduce the likelihood of the younger child developing allergies.The AAP is also concerned about antibiotic use in animal agriculture, stating that it poses a human health risk. However, the AAP did not go so far as to suggest universal precautions against consuming animals treated with antibiotics.	-	children,mortality,dairy,meat,industry influence,cardiovascular disease,breastfeeding,pregnancy,infants,milk,women's health,breast milk,allergies,cardiovascular health,heart health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/10/coca-cola-stopped-sponsoring-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/03/how-to-prevent-childhood-obesity-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-all-children-have-their-cholesterol-checked/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-infant-colic-by-changing-moms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peanuts-in-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-prediabetes-in-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-may-start-in-the-womb/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mythcrushers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/factory-farming-practices/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/peanuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-benjamin-spock/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/	
T-75	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/american-egg-board/	American Egg Board	The mission of the American Egg Board is, to quote their website, “to increase the demand for eggs and egg products through research, education and promotion.” To accomplish this goal, they may present misleading and even falsified information and scientific studies to the public.Cholesterol’s role in heart disease is of particular interest to the egg industry. The Egg Nutrition Center was created by the American Egg Board in order to downplay the risks of the cholesterol found in eggs to vascular health. They use multiple strategies in order to obtain the results they want, including performing the studies on subjects who begin with elevated cholesterol, comparing changes in cholesterol to those seen in response to foods very high in saturated fat, and only measuring fasting cholesterol. The egg industry also pays scientists to try to discredit studies that suggest cholesterol promotes human disease.Choline has been recently raised as a concern about the safety of egg consumption with regards to the development and progression of cancer and atherosclerosis. The American Egg Board, however, continues to promote the choline content of eggs as a selling point. The American Egg board also cites nutrients such as lutein as health promoting components of eggs even though these may only be found in trace amounts.The U.S. government does exercise some control over the egg industry’s ability to mislead the public about their product via the USDA advertising regulations; if egg companies wish to use American Egg Board funds to create advertisements, they are legally not allowed to use the words: “healthy,” “nutritious,” “healthful,” “good for you,” “safe,” “part of a healthy diet,” or “a good source of protein, lutein, folate, Omega 3’s, or iron.” The egg industry not only lobbies politicians to maintain the current egg friendly nutrition policies in the USDA dietary guidelines, but members of the American Egg Board serve on the committees that determine what the dietary guidelines will be.	-	eggs,industry influence,heart health,meat,cholesterol,heart disease,dairy,mortality,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,poultry,chicken,fat,animal products,stroke	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/10/coca-cola-stopped-sponsoring-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/26/peeks-behind-the-egg-industry-curtain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/20/what-do-eggs-do-to-our-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/28/egg-consumption-and-ldl-cholesterol-size/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/25/our-tax-dollars-subsidize-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/21/why-the-egg-cancer-link/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/06/egg-industry-caught-making-false-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/19/how-eggs-can-impact-body-odor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/19/why-are-eggs-linked-to-cancer-progression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/22/the-effects-of-dietary-cholesterol-on-blood-cholesterol/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-choline-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-the-egg-board-designs-misleading-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increasing-protein-intake-age-65/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/http:/nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-conflicts-of-interest/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-choline-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/choline,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-the-egg-board-designs-misleading-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/http:/nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/USDA,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/folate,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lutein,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iron,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-conflicts-of-interest/	
T-82	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/amla/	amla	Amla, also known as Indian gooseberry, is one of the most antioxidant rich foods on Earth. In a test of over 3,000 foods, amla turned out to be the number-one antioxidant-rich food. Amla powder can be blended into a morning smoothie for a hefty antioxidant boost.Amla may be effective in treating diabetes, and in an in vitro study, amla demonstrated nearly the same ability as a leading chemotherapy drug in cutting tumor growth, and the amla powder preserved and even enhanced normal cell growth.Amla has been used in Ayurvedic, Chinese, and Thai medicine for centuries, and preclinical studies have shown that it possesses many disease-combatting properties. It has also been used as a snake venom neutralizer and hair tonic, and may be an effective component in homemade mouthwash.	-	gooseberries,berries,fruit,India,phytonutrients,cancer,dried fruit,oxidative stress,antioxidants,cloves,medications,in vitro studies,blueberries,side effects,breast disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/21/making-your-own-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/12/saffron-vs-prozac-for-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/19/breast-cancer-stem-cells-vs-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/24/mushrooms-and-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/17/amla-indian-gooseberries-versus-cancer-diabetes-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/03/hibiscus-tea-the-best-beverage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/27/is-caffeinated-tea-really-dehydrating/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Ayurvedic-medicine,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/	
T-96	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/angina/	angina	Angina pectoris, or simply angina, is recurring heart muscle cramping from blockage of the arteries feeding the heart (coronary arteries). Angina represents early cardiovascular disease. An ‘attack’ of angina, signified by silent, mild or crushing chest pain, may turn into a full-blown heart attack, when part of the heart muscle dies.To prevent angina attacks, doctors prescribe blood vessel-dilating medications (e.g., nitroglycerin tablets), which patients put under the tongue when an attack begins. ‘Nitro’ works by causing nitrate release that relaxes the coronary vessel muscular walls, letting more blood flow through, but it does not address the underlying cause of chest pain symptoms.Dr. Dean Ornish demonstrated how simply putting cardiac patients on a quasi-vegan diet, without any change in their exercise regimens, could lower patients’ angina attacks by 90% within just 24 days. And while we know that plant-based diets can reverse heart disease, dissolve plaque, and open up arteries (in many instances without drugs or surgery), physicians themselves may be preventing their patients from choosing a plant-based diet. Why? Because they often assume their patients won’t have the discipline to make fundamental changes to their diet. What’s more, traditional medicine relies more on drugs than lifestyle modifications, even when patients are faced with a choice between surgery, which contains inherent risks, and drugs with serious potential side effects.Blockage of the coronary arteries is a direct result of buildup of LDL cholesterol that comes from eating saturated and trans fats, cholesterol found in animal products and processed foods, and lack of fiber. A plant-based diet alone may prevent angina attacks and improve heart health, but even more may be achieved by also changing modifiable behaviors using lifestyle medicine. Adding an exercise program approved by one’s physician, for example, and implementing simple stress management techniques may minimize the risk of developing heart disease.	-	cardiovascular disease,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular health,cholesterol,plant-based diets,mortality,Dr. Dean Ornish,LDL cholesterol,blood clots,chronic diseases,inflammation,meat,dairy,lifestyle medicine	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/20/pills-vs-diet-for-erectile-dysfunction/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fatty-meals-may-impair-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resuscitating-medicare/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hearts-shouldnt-skip-a-beet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-treatment-for-angina/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifestyle-medicine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Dr.-Dean-Ornish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nitroglycerin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol	
T-101	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-fat/	animal fat	Nutrition research suggests that we should eat less animal fat. Thirteen of the top fifteen sources of cholesterol-raising fat in the U.S. diet may come from animal fat intake. Diets rich in whole, plant foods and low in animal-fat consumption appear to provide protection against many serious health conditions. Diabetes: Rising diabetes rates in Asia may coincide with increased consumption of animal fat and animal protein. One study showed that shifting people from animal fats to plant fats can improve insulin sensitivity.  Another found that higher pre-pregnancy intakes of animal fat and cholesterol were associated with elevated gestational diabetes risk. Cancer: Studies have found possible links between animal fat intake and cancer risk. Dioxin and other toxic pollutants may accumulate in animal fats; these chemicals and other industrial carcinogens may be passed along to humans who consume the animal fats. Poultry appears to be the animal fat most associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk, though other animal fats can increase the risk as well. High animal protein and fat consumption may be a risk factor for both prostate enlargement and prostate cancer.  Animal protein and fat intake appear linked with endometrial cancer risk. Other studies conclude that the saturated fat in animal fat may decrease the length of cancer survival.Heart disease and related conditions: Eliminating saturated animal fat completely can be an important step in trying to reducing heart attack risk. Saturated animal fat intake may cause a spike in inflammation after consumption, which can increase risk of heart disease as well as other chronic diseases. A high-fat meal from animal sources may adversely affect our arteries, while a high-fat meal from plant sources apparently does not. This may be because of the saturated animal fat facilitating the absorption of bacterial endotoxins that may be present in animal foods. Saturated animal fat intake can also cause our blood vessels to become stiff and inflamed within hours. Reducing animal fat intake may help lower LDL cholesterol and lower blood pressure. About 50% of the trans fats eaten by Americans come from animal fat; trans fats are associated with increased heart disease risk.Animal fat appears to be implicated in a number of other diseases and

T-102	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/	animal products	Animal products are a central part of the standard American diet and appear to be linked to a range of unhealthy conditions. As early as 1907, the New York Times reported on a study that suggested increased consumption of animal foods was a key factor in 4,600 studied cancer cases. The massive Cornell-Oxford-China study conducted in the 1970’s and 80’s showed that even small amounts of animal-based food were associated with a measurable increase in risk of some chronic diseases. Diets rich in animal foods have been linked in numerous studies to higher risk for heart disease and cancer mortality. Animal food consumption is also associated with an increased risk of being overweight, possibly because the regular consumption of calorie dense animal foods and junk foods can so blunt our brain’s pleasure center that we can tend to overeat. Researchers in one study saw improvement in key health measures in people who went on a diet free of animal products for just 21 days. Another study showed that cutting out all animal products and putting Parkinson’s disease patients on a strict vegan diet led to a significant improvement in symptoms. Cutting down on junk food and animal products for even a few weeks may help one’s tongue become more sensitive to fat and less prone to overeating.Research studies have found potential links between the intake of animal products and risks of the following diseases and conditions:Reducing animal product consumption while also increasing whole plant food intake has many potential benefits, based on research studies, including:   There are a number of unhealthy substances (naturally occurring, added, or accumulated from feed and the environment) contained in some animal products, including:   U.S. government policy as it relates to animal products has at times been controversial, due especially to lobbying by powerful animal product industries. See Dietary Guidelines and USDA for details. Some health advocates have proposed reducing subsidies that help make animal food products artificially cheap.     See related health topics animal fat, animal protein, beef, chicken, eggs, fish,

T-103	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/	animal protein	Most Americans may eat more protein than their bodies need.Cancer may be associated with increased consumption of animal protein. Animal proteins putrefy when incompletely digested, increasing colonic alkalinity and producing gases associated with dramatic rises in colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. The cancer link may be attributed to animal protein’s stimulation of IGF-1. If the proteins are cooked at high temperatures (frying, broiling), potent carcinogens such as PhIP and other heterocyclic amines can be created. Leucine in protein stimulates TOR (Target of Rapamycin), which can accelerate aging and promote colon and breast cancer.Kidney problems and diabetes may also be related to animal protein. Animal protein can impair kidney function and contribute to kidney stones. Animal protein may also exacerbate the insulin spike of carbohydrate ingestion and contribute to diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness. Adenovirus which can come from eating chicken, is strongly linked to childhood obesity with later diabetic consequences.Animal protein has been linked to other negative health effects, including acne, female infertility, infant sleep apnea, autism, crib death, and premature puberty.A plant-based diet can supply adequate amounts of protein. Plant sources of protein may be preferable to animal-based, as their proteins contain more potassium and fewer sulfur-containing amino acids, such as leucine and methionine.

T-114	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antibiotics/	antibiotics	Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was discovered from bread mold. Since its discovery, many miraculous antibiotics have been developed, but are we coming to the end of an era? Certain antibiotic infections used to only develop and be transmitted in hospitals, but not anymore. It turns out that livestock may consume nearly 80% of the antibiotics in the USA. This may then create the antibiotic resistant superbugs such as MRSA, Yersinia, and Staph, that are now found in a significant portion of store bought meat, and that kill 23, 000 Americans every year. Seems a high price to pay to save a penny per pound at the till.Normal cooking can kill some, but not all, of these superbugs, and cross-contamination may lead to infection regardless of how well the meat is cooked. Certain E. coli infections of the gut may lead to urinary tract infections (UTI’s) that may indirectly increase the risk of breast cancer because treatment with antibiotics can wipe out beneficial gut bacteria. Disrupting the delicate balance of the gut microbiome may also lead to weight gain and diarrhea. Drugs like antibiotics have been considered one possible explanation for the link between chicken consumption and other cancers. Cranberry juice seems to be protective against UTI’s and owning a dog may reduce the risk of ear infections in children and in doing so may reduce antibiotic exposure..Evidence based medicine is finally doing away with the neutropenic diet for cancer patients, but is there a diet we should follow? In one study, organic meat seems to be slightly less contaminated than traditional, and may also have lower proportion of MDR bacteria. Antibiotics may not be the only drugs (or heavy metals) we’re getting with meat. A vegetarian diet may lower the levels of antibiotics in people not actually taking antibiotics. White meat of chicken may contain more antibiotics than dark meat. Using antiseptic mouthwash may inhibit your athletic prowess; swishing with green tea is a good alternative.	-	cancer,poultry,meat,food poisoning,chicken,farm animals,factory farming

T-115	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antidepressants/	antidepressants	Depression can be a debilitating mental illness that sometimes ends in suicide. An estimated 8.7% of Americans take antidepressants to battle depression.  Antidepressants use different mechanisms to increase the levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. Many researchers believe that a chemical imbalance of these neurotransmitters may lead to depression.Tricyclic antidepressants block the uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine while Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin by neurons. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) inhibit the action of the major enzyme, monoamine oxidase, which breaks down serotonin before it can be taken up by neurons. Antidepressants take a significant amount of time to decrease depressive symptoms. Drugs such as Prozac and Celexa take a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks to be effective, whereas the drug Paxil takes up to 12 weeks.Meta-analyses have shown that antidepressants are effective at reducing mild to moderate depressive symptoms, but also revealed that sugar pills, or the placebo effect, were about as effective as the drugs. So there was no clinically significant advantage for prescribing antidepressants instead of a sugar pill.  For severe depression, antidepressants performed better than placebos.Researchers found that many of the studies demonstrating a lack of clear advantages to the drugs over placebos were never published, and in some cases, may have even been concealed by the pharmaceutical industry. In the multi-billion dollar antidepressant market, there are some powerful industry influences at work.Antidepressants have some powerful negative side effects. Up to three-quarters of individuals who take antidepressants experience sexual dysfunction. Other side effects include long-term weight gain, insomnia, nausea and diarrhea. Withdrawal symptoms are not uncommon, and those who take antidepressants are more likely to become depressed in the future.Widespread antidepressant use also has consequences for the environment. Some of the drugs’ metabolites are excreted in the urine of people taking antidepressants, and ends up in our waterways. Worse still, the drugs have been found to bioaccumulate in the flesh of fish as well as their brains.Plant-based diets have shown promising results when compared to antidepressants. Just three servings of vegetables per week cut the risk for major depression by 60%. As well, drugs can take months to take effect, whereas mood can improve in as little as two weeks by removing meat, fish, poultry and eggs from the diet.Certain plants have also been found to have depression-associated enzyme inhibitors. The tobacco plant is one of them, which may explain what makes smokers feel good. Saffron capsules have been shown to be as effective as the SSRI Prozac in a six-week trial with clinically depressed participants. Other plants, including apples, berries, grapes, kale, onions and green tea, have phytonutrients that may affect brain biology enough to improve mood without the negative consequences of tobacco or the side effects of antidepressants.Exercise has also been shown to have antidepressant effects.	-	medications,Prozac,SSRI's,depression,mental health,side effects,mood,complementary medicine,alternative medicine,plant-based diets,exercise,fruit,vision,industry influence,chicken	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/24/exercise-as-a-treatment-for-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/26/are-sugar-pills-better-than-antidepressant-drugs/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-the-blues-with-greens-mao-inhibitors-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-fine-kettle-of-fluoxetine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-vs-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/curing-painful-diabetic-neuropathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-antidepressant-drugs-really-work/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prozac-residues-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/exercise-vs-drugs-for-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-oil-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lung-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apples/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prozac-residues-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bioaccumulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/side-effects/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tobacco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ssris/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mao-inhibitors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meta-analysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grapes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dopamine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-fine-kettle-of-fluoxetine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/placebo-effect/	
T-120	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants/	antioxidants	On average, plant foods contain 64 times the antioxidant power of animal products. This may be why those eating a plant-based diet, even for a short amount of time, generally have higher antioxidant levels. The meat industry has considered adding plant foods to meat in order to boost antioxidant levels, though this may make processed meat more carcinogenic.Antioxidant supplements do not appear to have the same benefits as whole foods, and may decrease lifespan.Antioxidants help protect against free radicals and DNA damage, including countering possible DNA damage caused by high-intensity exercise or radiation exposure from air flights.Antioxidants may enhance dental health, protect against skin aging, slow general aging, reduce Alzheimer’s risk, reduce inflammation, maintain male fertility and sexual function, prevent and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prevent and treat asthma, prevent the hardening of arteries, reduce risk for stroke, heart attack, heart disease, and cancer, lower cholesterol, block the formation of nitrites into carcinogens, and increase stool size, and lower the risk of asthma, depression, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, stomach cancer, and esophageal cancer.A daily antioxidant goal in the U.S. for men is 11,000 units a day, while the daily goal for women is 8,000, with no apparent upper limit. To stay out of oxidative debt, one should try to eat antioxidant-rich plant foods at every meal, especially if we’re under stress, as antioxidant levels can plummet within two hours of a stressful event.   Organic produce appears to have more antioxidants than conventional. Hydroponic basil has higher antioxidant content than basil grown in soil. For vegetables, whether they’re cooked or raw can affect the antioxidant levels – boiling may best retain the antioxidant power of sweet potatoes, and boiled beans may have more antioxidants than sprouted. Cold-steeped tea may make more antioxidants available than hot tea. Whole fruits, beans and other legumes, nuts, and vegetables are high in antioxidants. Ounce per ounce, herbs and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, and peppermint are so rich in antioxidants, that just a small pinch can go a long way.A general rule of thumb is to pick the deepest colored fruit or vegetable since many of the antioxidants are plant pigments. Specific foods that are high in antioxidants include acai berries, apples, Amla or Indian gooseberries, beets, berries, black beans, pinto beans, lentils, red kidney beans, Ceylon cinnamon, chai tea, chamomile tea, dandelion tea, lemongrass tea, rosehip tea, rooibos tea, cherries, cloves, cranberries and cranberry juice without added sugar, currants, dark chocolate, dates, date sugar, molasses, dragon’s blood, dried pomegranate seeds, dried Indian gooseberries, dried apples, dried cherries, goji berries, flaxseed, green tea, hibiscus tea, kale, lemon balm tea, most leafy greens, olives, mushrooms, pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts, pistachio nuts, plums, pecans, pears, pomegranates, artichokes, red rice, black rice, tomato juice, turmeric curcumin, coffee, and whole oats. Ranking widely available foods by number of antioxidants per dollar spent, red cabbage tops the list. Caloric restriction and exercise may also boost antioxidant needs.	-	vegetables,cardiovascular health,fruit,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,heart health,cancer,mortality,DNA damage,tea,in vitro

T-123	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/anxiety/	anxiety	Vegetarians appear to have a better overall mood when compared to omnivores. This may be due the consequences of eating more plants, such as higher serum carotenoid levels and increased serotonin in the brain. Conversely, part of this effect may be due to decreasing negative factors associated with meat, such as the anxiety producing chemical ractopamine, or the inflammatory arachidonic acid. New evidence suggests that our gut bacteria may actually be able to communicate with our brain to affect our mood. Certain odors appear to significantly affect our mood as well. Orange aromatherapy may decrease anxiety while increasing concentration, and lavender may be more effective than benzodiazepine drugs like valium. It appears however that you’ll have to do more than just sniff some saffron to improve PMS. Apple juice might improve the mood of Alzheimer’s patients (though not their memory). It appears music can be medicinal, but you might want to make it Mozart to maximize your mood.	-	mental health,depression,mood,fruit,side effects,suicide,women's health,inflammation,mortality,men's health,antioxidants,stress,plant-based diets,hypertension,high blood pressure	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/07/how-probiotics-affect-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/31/does-orange-aromatherapy-reduce-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/06/why-some-like-cilantro-and-others-hate-it/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/27/plant-based-diets-for-fibromyalgia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/04/inflammation-diet-and-vitamin-s/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/21/treating-migraines-with-lavender/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/14/using-lavender-to-treat-anxiety/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/music-for-anxiety-mozart-vs-metal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-and-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stomach-stapling-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ractopamine-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-for-menstrual-cramps-and-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/music-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-cilantro-gene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-happier-people-actually-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/memory,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ractopamine-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/anxiety/utritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-and-depression,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/music-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat

T-134	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apple-juice/	apple juice	As opposed to the peel, the juice of apples alone does not seem to offer any outstanding health benefits. Apple juice appears to have less than one-third the antioxidant power of the whole apple. Apple juice ranked six in terms of antioxidant levels compared to eight other possible airline beverages. When measuring phenolic content, which may help provide Alzheimer’s disease protection, clear apple juice ranked eighth out of nine fruit juices. A daily cup of apple juice may not produce any change in cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s patients, but apple juice concentrate may help protect human nerve cells from the neurotoxic Alzheimer’s plaque protein, amyloid Beta in vitro.Probiotics taken with apple juice do not seem to be effective in helping to ensure probiotic bacteria survival. Unlike red cranberry juice, apple juice does not appear to reduce bladder infection risk. Consumption of whole fruits, including apples, seems associated with a lower type 2 diabetes risk, whereas greater juice consumption seems linked to a higher risk. Similarly, apple consumption may be associated with lower heart attack risk, but drinking apple juice may increase risk. Conventional apple juices from around the world often exceed World Health Organization fungal level safety guidelines, but organic juices seem to be within the safety limits. Apple juice may contain levels of arsenic higher than deemed safe in drinking water by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Drinking apple juice may produce uric acid in the body, and even pureed apples leads to a spike in insulin, but eating heated pureed apples may decrease hunger leading to fewer calories consumed throughout the day.	-	fruit juice,fruit,apples,phytonutrients,juice,cancer,vegetables,bananas,berries,vitamin C,grapes,pork,polyphenols,smoothies,fat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/23/reducing-arsenic-in-chicken-and-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/25/apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/06/the-best-foods-test-your-nutrition-knowledge/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/29/alzheimers-disease-up-to-half-of-cases-potentially-preventable-with-lifestyle-changes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/02/how-should-i-take-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/25/nutritionfacts-org-the-first-month/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/how-much-arsenic-in-rice-came-from-chickens/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-veggies-versus-cooked-for-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liquid-calories-do-smoothies-lead-to-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-fruit-whose-juice-is-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-smoothies-what-does-the-science-say/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fungal-toxins-in-apples/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-veggies-versus-cooked-for-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/19/dr-oz-apple-juice-and-arsenic-chicken-may-have-10-times-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/http:/nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phenolics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/world-health-organization,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apples,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cranberry-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-fruit-whose-juice-is-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-smoothies-what-does-the-science-say/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods	
T-137	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apples/	apples	Eating a variety of fruit has many health benefits including potentially reducing the risk of cancers such as breast, oral, larynx, colon, kidney, and ovarian. Apples may also reduce the risk of heart disease. Apples rank high (in a past top 12 list) in terms of antioxidants per serving and antioxidants per unit cost, but skip the juice. Apples contain potent phytonutrients that may increase protection from environmental dioxins. But apple juice has fewer phytonutrients, maybe due to removing the fiber. The fiber in whole apples slows the release of sugars into the blood stream, resulting in an insulin rise less than that caused by a hamburger patty. The fiber may also help promote good bacteria in our colons, and reduce the risk of stroke. Even dried apples have been shown to have extraordinary health-promoting benefits and may help with weight loss. We should keep the peel on for maximum benefits. Eating whole apples appears to be associated with improved mood, and be protective against asthma and skin wrinkles. Be cautious of potential fungal toxins in some conventional brands of apple juice and the brown spots within apples, but there does not appear to be any benzene (unlike carrot juice) in apple juice and the levels of AGEs in apples are low. Fruits and vegetables like apples are also lower in leucine, which may be an advantage.	-	fruit,vegetables,berries,cancer,fiber,antioxidants,vitamin C,bananas,water,weight loss,fat,soda,junk

T-139	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arachidonic-acid/	arachidonic acid	Arachidonic acid is an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid. Our bodies produce this nutrient, and its excess may lead to inflammatory diseases and mood disorders.Arachidonic acid is found in animal products, like poultry and eggs. The amount of arachidonic acid found in just one egg a day elevated arachidonic acid levels in the bloodstream, Japanese researchers learned.Arachidonic acid may trigger brain inflammation. High blood levels have been associated with a greater risk of suicide and depressive episodes. On the other hand, diets high in carbohydrate and low in fat and protein (with little or no arachidonic acid) may be associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression, according to epidemiological studies.In one study, overweight or diabetic employees who went on a whole food, plant-based diet reported increased energy, better sleep patterns and improved mental health compared to a control group given no diet restrictions. Their work productivity also showed improvement.A similar subsequent study of employees at 10 corporate sites showed notable improvements in depression, anxiety and emotional well-being among those following a meat-free, plant-based diet.Animal protein from meat and fish has also been associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Arachidonic acid has been identified as one possible reason why. Even a semi-vegetarian diet has been shown to be highly beneficial in preventing relapses among patients suffering from Crohn’s disease.	-	plant-based diets,inflammation,chicken,vegetarians,meat,animal products,eggs,vegans,poultry,vegetables,depression,fish,cancer,mental health,fruit	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/27/can-we-fight-the-blues-with-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/13/is-titanium-dioxide-in-food-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/06/egg-industry-caught-making-false-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/05/eating-green-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/04/inflammation-diet-and-vitamin-s/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-the-blues-with-greens-mao-inhibitors-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-meat-can-be-a-lifesaver/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chickens-fate-is-sealed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/crohns-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mental-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/anxiety	
T-146	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arsenic/	arsenic	Arsenic is a category one (the highest level) carcinogen. Most of the arsenic in the American diet may gave come from meat; arsenic-containing drugs have been fed to farm animals to kill intestinal parasites, which can convert to inorganic arsenic during cooking. It accumulates, along with other banned chemicals, as slaughterhouse byproducts can be recycled as animal feed. Chicken probably has the most arsenic, and seems to be the primary source of arsenic found in children. But fish may also not be safe in this regard. In fact, arsenic is used a biomarker for total fish and seafood intake.One seaweed species, hijiki (also commonly spelled hiziki), absorbs so much arsenic from the sea water that it is not safe to eat. Rice grown in water logged soil can absorb arsenic found in the environment naturally or from from pesticide use or chicken manure fertilizer. The common Ayurvedic medicine triphala has been found to be contaminated with arsenic, lead, and mercury.	-	lead,heavy metals,mercury,industrial pollutants,fish,cancer,meat,medications,chicken,persistent organic pollutants,women's health,carcinogens,alternative medicine,cadmium,complementary medicine	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/23/reducing-arsenic-in-chicken-and-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/21/the-real-paleo-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/26/why-are-chickens-fed-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/02/adding-fda-approved-viruses-to-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/how-much-arsenic-in-rice-came-from-chickens/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-vs-veggie-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-intake-biomarker/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-pills-vs-tanning-beds/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-vs-veggie-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/farm-animals,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-intake-biomarker/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-pills-vs-tanning-beds/	
T-147	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arthritis/	arthritis	Animal products, including eggs, dairy, meat, and animal protein in general may increase inflammation. A single meal of meat, eggs, or dairy may cause a spike of inflammation within hours that can stiffen one’s arteries. Several factors may account for this effect, including heme iron, endotoxins, saturated fat, high bacteria load, TMAO, tapeworms, advanced glycation end products or AGEs, and NeuGc, a foreign meat that may increase the risk of heart disease and cancer.A plant-based diet may improve or even eliminate arthritis symptoms. Specifically, turmeric may provide people with as much relief as medications for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Avocados, berries and flaxseed oil have also been shown to be helpful in decreasing general arthritis symptoms.Arthritis may be triggered by the Yersinia bacteria found in pork products. Avoiding animal products may prevent the onset of auto-immune conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis may also be improved with potassium supplementation and cilantro.Animal foods are rich in purines, which are associated with increased gout risk. This is why gout patients may see an improvement in symptoms when they switch to a plant-based diet. Ingestion of cherries, or cherry juice, appears to be a side effect free treatment option for gout.Osteoarthritis appears to respond to anti-inflammatory foods, for example, rose hips. Studies also have shown improvement of symptoms of osteoarthritis through the addition of açai berries to the diet.	-	heart health,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,joint

T-151	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/artificial-sweeteners/	artificial sweeteners	Artificial sweeteners are man-made substitutes for table sugar in food and beverages.Popular artificial sweeteners include: acesulfame K (Sweet One®), aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet®), cyclamate (Sugar Twin®), erythritol ( Zsweet®), saccharin (Sweet’N Low®), stevia (Truvía®, Pure Via®),  sucralose (Splenda®), xylitol (XyloSweet®) and sorbitol.Acesulfame K has been associated with various cancers in studies.  Cyclamate has been banned in the United States since 1970 because of studies indicating an association with bladder cancer.  Saccharin has also been associated with bladder cancer.  Sucralose may be a migraine trigger and negatively affect gut microbiome.Around 92% of independent studies report adverse health effects associated with aspartame. During digestion, aspartame is converted to methanol (wood alcohol) and then formaldehyde (a known carcinogen) in the large intestine. Adverse health effects reported include:  pre-term births, fibromyalgia, hypertension, brain disorders, blood platelet disorders, migraine headaches and bowel disorders.Erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol are sugar alcohols.  Xylitol and sorbitol are used in consumer products like gum, sugar-free candies and toothpaste.  Studies show these two sweeteners may draw fluid into the colon in digestion and have a laxative effect.  Erythritol may not have the same laxative effect as it is absorbed in the small intestine. Erythritol also behaves like an antioxidant to act against free radicals.Stevia is extracted from the leaves of the Stevia Rebaudiana plant and heavily processed. The resulting steviocides in the consumer product are converted into steviol in the gut, which may be toxic and cause mutagenic DNA damage in great enough quantities.  The World Health Organization has defined safe daily consumption at up to 1.8 milligrams per pound of body weight.Studies have shown an association between consumption of three artificial sweeteners (sucralose, acesulfame K, aspartame) and an increase in inflammatory bowel disorders like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. This is thought to be caused by a negative impact in the large intestinal flora, the microbiome. However, healthy microbiome can be restored a few weeks after cessation of consumption of these substances. Consumption of maltodextrin, a polysaccharide in sucralose and aspartame, may also worsen Crohn’s disease.Studies show a direct relationship between consumption of foods containing artificial sweeteners and weight gain. The reasons for this are: 1) “reverse causation”, i.e., the more weight people gain, the more they consume artificial sweeteners to try to offset the weight gain, 2) overcompensation for expected calorie reduction (e.g., having a diet cola with a double cheeseburger) and 3) the appetite-promoting effect of sweet substances on the tongue versus the appetite suppression effect of actual calories in the gut.Other studies have shown artificial sweeteners may contribute to obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.	-	sugar,sweeteners,soda,aspartame,calories,processed foods,obesity,weight loss,Harvard,fruit,saccharin,NutraSweet,FDA,caloric restriction,fat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/20/food-additives-that-may-make-our-gut-leaky/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/01/side-effects-of-aspartame-on-the-brain/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-crohns-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-nutrasweet-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-diet-soda-increase-stroke-risk-as-much-as-regular-soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsweetening-the-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-aspartame-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-soda-and-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-and-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/neurobiology-of-artificial-sweeteners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-induced-fibromyalgia/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sorbitol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saccharin,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stevia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/erythritol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/formaldehyde/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/xylitol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cyclamate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/laxatives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/metabolic-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/world-health-organization/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aspartame,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sucralose,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/acesulfame-k/	
T-154	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asia/	Asia	Even though cancer rates seem to be on the rise in Asia, the paradox is that lung cancer and heart disease are still lower than would be expected given their smoking patterns. It might be the mushrooms and green tea, or the seaweed, or the soy (but not too much) that offer protection. The problem may be that as Asia westernizes its diet, they move away from these foods and opt for more processed and animal foods, which may be particularly problematic when the meat is imported from the west due to our use of anabolic steroids in farm animals. But that’s a two way street: it appears US grown rice has less arsenic than Asian grown. A more traditional Asian diet also appears to be protective against dementia, GERD, and mastalgia. The rise in meat consumption in Asia has mirrored an epidemic in diabetes; it appears that animal protein amplifies the insulin spike caused by plain white rice, and adding a small amount of meat to an otherwise healthy Asian diet might increase risk of diabetes. Though some meats may be safer than others.	-	soy,cancer,women's health,beans,fruit,mortality,vegetables,cardiovascular disease,Japan,heart disease,weight loss,obesity,breast cancer,meat,stomach health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/27/how-avoiding-eggs-could-help-you-avoid-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/11/why-less-breast-cancer-in-asia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/18/reversal-of-chronic-disease-risk-even-late-in-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/12/where-are-the-lowest-rates-of-alzheimers-in-the-world/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/07/treating-breast-pain-with-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/worth-switching-white-rice-brown/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-brown-fat-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-gerd-acid-reflux-heartburn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-epidemiological-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/never-too-late-to-start-eating-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-soy-healthy-for-breast-cancer-survivors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-for-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-most-potent-phytoestrogen-is-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lung-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/farm-animals,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/never-too-late-to-start-eating-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rice,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-gerd-acid-reflux-heartburn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-foods,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/	
T-157	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aspartame/	aspartame	Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners, or non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs), contain no calories and offer no nutritional benefits. They have been developed and added to the food supply in place of caloric sweeteners as a prevention strategy in the fight against obesity. Aspartame (NutraSweet) is one of the five NNSs that the FDA has approved as “Generally Recognized as Safe.” These NNSs are hundreds of times sweeter than sucrose and are used in thousands of products worldwide, most predominately in diet soda. While these products are approved by the FDA, an ongoing debate persists over their safety, efficacy, and correlation to obesity and diabetes.Women’s health and pregnancy may be affected by NNS use, as daily intake of diet soda may increase the risk of preterm deliveries. Over 90% of independent studies have shown that aspartame may cause adverse health effects. Moreover, aspartame is metabolized into methanol, which is converted to formaldehyde and formic acid, which is toxic. Aspartame and other NNSs have been shown to induce glucose intolerance by affecting gut microbiota. There is also an association between total aspartame consumption and risk of multiple myeloma, fibromyalgia, hypertension, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and leukemia.Diet soda consumption has been linked to increased depression, with individuals who already suffer from mood disorders having a higher risk when consuming aspartame, as aspartame may be linked to mental disorders and the compromise of learning and emotional functions. In a study with healthy individuals, half of the FDA’s recommended daily allowance of aspartame (25mg/kg body weight) was administered, and after eight days, participants experienced an increase in irritable mood, depression, and decreased brain function.Several large-scale prospective cohort studies have found a positive correlation between aspartame-sweetened diet soda and increased weight gain. This may be due to overeating in light of the calories saved by drinking diet sodas.	-	soda,artificial sweeteners,sweeteners,sugar,NutraSweet,saccharin,Sweet'N Low,brain health,calories,formaldehyde,FDA,pregnancy,women's health,migraine headaches,heart health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/30/aspartame-fibromyalgia-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/01/side-effects-of-aspartame-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/21/treating-migraines-with-lavender/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-aspartame-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-nutrasweet-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-soda-and-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-mgus-and-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-and-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-aspartame/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-induced-fibromyalgia/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sweeteners,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/NutraSweet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/FDA,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/microbiome,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/calories,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/artificial-sweeteners	
T-158	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aspirin/	aspirin	Many of the most powerful drugs in modern medicine’s arsenal come from natural products such as aspirin, which comes from the bark of the willow tree, but aspirin was ignored for almost 3,000 years by the medical profession.  Plants produce aspirin when they get infected. People have been using plants for the aspirin benefits long before we had access to aspirin tablet making machinery. Those eating healthy, heavily plant focused diets may already have aspirin in their bloodstream whereas those eating a more meat-based diet had about twice the odds of being on aspirin, sleeping pills, tranquilizers, antacids, pain-killers, blood pressure medications, laxatives and insulin.There’s a natural phytonutrient in cherries with anti-inflammatory effects on par with drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen.  The anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin are so powerful that it should be avoided during pregnancy. Aspirin should not be used for the primary prevention of heart attacks and stroke, (as the potential benefit has not been shown to outweigh the risk of significant bleeding). Additionally, tomatoes may work better than aspirin in the prevention of platelet activation, in part, perhaps, because compounds made by plants such as aspirin and curcumin affect multiple platelet pathways simultaneously.	-	vegetables,fruit,inflammation,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,cardiovascular health,heart health,cancer,stroke,blood clots,mortality,plant-based diets,colon cancer,vegans,medications	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/28/inhibiting-platelet-activation-tomato-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/10/how-plants-can-be-both-safer-and-more-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/01/how-humans-benefit-from-stressed-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/04/inflammation-diet-and-vitamin-s/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/05/why-pepper-boosts-turmeric-blood-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/03/foods-with-natural-melatonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/10/plant-based-benefits-extend-beyond-the-top-killers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/02/the-number-one-global-diet-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-doctors-responded-to-being-named-a-leading-killer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-tomato-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspirin-levels-in-plant-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/appropriating-plant-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caution-anti-inflammatory-foods-in-the-third-trimester/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-aggregation-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-tomato-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspirin-levels-in-plant-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/insulin,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/appropriating-plant-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tomatoes,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ibuprofen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-aggregation-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/platelets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-pressure,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/	
T-159	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asthma/	asthma	The incidence of atopic disease, including asthma, is increasing rapidly throughout the world. What is causing this epidemic? While environmental pollutants, such as second hand smoke and chemicals found in common scented household products may be playing a role in the increased occurrence of asthma, diet seems to have an effect on the risk of developing asthma. The changes in the Western diet over the last few decades away from fresh produce towards processed foods and animal products may also help explain the dramatic rise in the prevalence of asthma. Increased intake of seafood, meat, cod liver oil, poultry and dairy have been correlated with an increased risk for asthma, while the consumption of fresh fruits, green vegetables and soy products has been shown to be protective. In fact, switching to a plant-based diet can successfully treat symptoms of the disease (unlike homeopathy or even some medications specifically designed for this purpose).Babies born via caesarean section or naturally to mothers with disturbances in vaginal flora are at increased risk for developing asthma.Some individual plant foods may be used to treat asthma, and could be added generously to the diet for side-effect free symptom management. Tomatoes, oatmeal, adhatoda and black pepper, and turmeric may have positive therapeutic effects on asthma patients.	-	chronic diseases,cancer,grains,inflammation,children,inflammatory bowel disease,hypertension,depression,blood pressure,allergies,bread,cardiovascular health,omega-3 fatty acids,weight loss,alternative medicine	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/10/how-plants-can-be-both-safer-and-more-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/09/using-diet-to-treat-asthma-and-eczema/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/02/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-treat-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/11/a-simple-yet-neglected-cure-for-childhood-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/18/gluten-sensitivity-put-to-the-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/09/benefits-of-oatmeal-for-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-rice-vs-black-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-diet-for-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ractopamine-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/throw-household-products-off-the-scent/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-help-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-constipation-and-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-sensitivity-real/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-strengthen-the-mind-body-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-homeopathy-just-placebo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-asthma/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/infants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ractopamine-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-homeopathy-just-placebo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/throw-household-products-off-the-scent/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-food,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-help-fatty-liver-disease/	
T-161	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/athletes/	athletes	Nitrate-rich vegetables such as beets may improve athletic performance and reduce oxygen needs. In order to work, the nitrates have to be converted to nitrites by bacteria that live on our tongues and using antiseptic mouthwash may prevent this from happening. As beets are high in oxalates, those who are prone to kidney stones may want to choose a different high nitrate food (such as low-oxalate greens) to boost athletic performance.Homemade peppermint water may also increase athletic performance. We should be wary of protein supplements to increase athletic performance, as more than half of protein supplements investigated were found to exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels.Daily citrus fruit consumption during athletic training may reduce muscle fatigue, and cherries can speed recovery after a marathon. A plant-based diet may help recover from the effects of high-intensity exercise, and we can boost natural killer cells activity by exercising. Exercise may also have anti-cancer benefits.	-	exercise,sports medicine,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,heart health,women's health,nitrates,greens,vegetables,beets,nitric oxide,side effects,Europe,testosterone	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/17/why-dont-more-doctors-practice-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/26/how-to-protect-our-telomeres-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/10/plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/13/preloading-with-watercress-before-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/20/can-peppermint-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/08/berries-to-prevent-muscle-soreness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/16/should-we-take-chlorella-to-boost-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/14/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hibiscus-tea-vs-plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veg-table-dietary-nitrate-scoring-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-use-antiseptic-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/music-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-insulin-resistance-old/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/out-of-the-lab-onto-the-track/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/barriers-to-heart-disease-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/priming-the-proton-pump/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-to-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-hepatitis-c-with-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whole-beets-vs-juice-for-improving-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhancing-athletic-performance-with-peppermint/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hearts-shouldnt-skip-a-beet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-exercise-induced-oxidative-stress-with-watercress/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-insulin-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/finger-pulse-longevity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-athlete-immunity-with-chlorella-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oxalates,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nitrate,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/peppermint,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-hepatitis-c-with-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-use-antiseptic-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/out-of-the-lab-onto-the-track/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhancing-athletic-performance-with-peppermint/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-stones,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-exercise-induced-oxidative-stress-with-watercress/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/	
T-170	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/autoimmune-diseases/	autoimmune diseases	Plant-based diets may successfully treat autoimmune diseases such as lichen planus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease (see also here and here), multiple sclerosis and some forms of cancer, which may have an autoimmune component.Systemic inflammation may contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. Each time meat is consumed, the body experiences a low-grade inflammation thought due to the introduction of bacterial endotoxins into the bloodstream. Arachidonic acid found in meat may directly activate the immune system, further promoting inflammation. Ingested animal hormones, found most highly concentrated in low-fat dairy, may also retain some physiological function, potentially encouraging pathological immune activation. Animal proteins, such as Neu5Gc and Alpha Gal, may be recognized as foreign after they have entered the body and trigger an immune response, exacerbating the problem even further. Processing meat can introduce compounds which may promote autoimmune diseases, such as meat glue. Finally, meat can contain live bacterial or viral contaminants, which, naturally, trigger an immune response once they have been internalized, whether via ingestion, inhalation or simple contact; this is thought to be the reason for increased incidence of specific autoimmune diseases among slaughterhouse, meat processing, and farm workers.Some of these live contaminating bacteria are known to directly cause autoimmune diseases. This has been established for Campylobacter and Guillaine Barre Syndrome (a life-threatening, autoimmune attack on the nervous system) and Yersinia and Grave’s disease. A similar mechanism links meat consumption to antibody production against Proteus mirabilis bacteria, which ultimately cross-react with proteins in our joint tissue, potentially causing rheumatoid arthritis. Why don’t plant proteins generate similar phenomena? They are simply too different from our own. One exception is gluten, a protein produced by wheat, which triggers autoimmune mediated celiac disease in 0.7% of the population and sensitivity in a small percentage more.Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in foods such as rosemary, cloves, ginger and turmeric have been shown to decrease inflammatory markers in vitro. Açai berries, strawberries, mushrooms and turmeric (see also here), have all been shown to decrease inflammation in vivo, sometimes with dramatic improvement in autoimmune symptoms. In the study in which it was addressed, decreases in inflammation did not appear to be accompanied by impaired immune responses to pathogens; on the contrary, the researchers observed an increase in “primary defence” IgA antibodies. Plants are also rich in potassium, which can stimulate the production of natural steroids that work to suppress inflammatory processes.	-	immune function,diabetes,dairy,milk,type 1

T-178	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/b12/	b12	Vitamin B12 is made by neither animals nor plants, but by microbes. Thankfully, in our sanitized world there are safe, cheap, convenient sources. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in vegans who don’t eat B12 fortified foods or take B12 supplements and can result in paralysis, myelopathy, psychosis, or atherosclerosis. A plant-based diet may improve Alzheimer’s symptoms, but if without B12 supplementation, a plant-based diet may make things worse. It is imperative that those eating plant-based diets include B12-fortified foods in their diet or take B12 supplements, especially pregnant or nursing women. Testing is not necessary, but supplementing is—it may even increase one’s lifespan. The recommended intake is 4-7 micrograms a day (but to get that much in daily or weekly supplements you have to take much more). Raw food diets are no exception to this rule. Omnivores under age 50 are rarely deficient in vitamin B12 (though may be deficient in other nutrients).	-	vitamin B12,plant-based diets,brain health,vegetarians,vegans,vegetables,protein,cholesterol,supplements,brain disease,fiber,mental health,animal protein,animal fat,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/18/the-vitamin-everyone-on-a-plant-based-diet-needs/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-supplements-worth-taking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/not-so-delusional-parasitosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegan-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetarians-myelopathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/did-a-vegan-diet-kill-this-baby/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-recommendation-change/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-meat-or-no-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inverted-rabbit-sign/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/daily-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegan-paralysis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-morbid-obesity-be-reversed-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-brain-loss-with-b-vitamins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/american-vegans-placing-babies-at-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrient-dense-approach-to-weight-management/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-supplements-worth-taking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?p=4060,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/inverted-rabbit-sign/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegetarians-myelopathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-recommendation-change/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-meat-or-no-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/daily-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegan-paralysis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/american-vegans-placing-babies-at-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/did-a-vegan-diet-kill-this-baby/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-brain-loss-with-b-vitamins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegan-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/	
T-181	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bacon/	bacon	Bacon contains a saturated fat, which can increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. Bacon can also raise blood pressure, contaminate breast milk with flame retardant chemicals, increases the risk of COPD, acute myeloid leukemia, gout, and gestational diabetes during pregnancy, and may decrease lifespan.  Even the fumes from cooking bacon may have carcinogenic and other disease-causing effects such as DNA mutation and postmenopausal breast cancer. The vacuum-packed bacon containers need preservatives and bacteria inhibitors such as harmful nitrites. The vitamin C added to “enrich” bacon arereported to make them even more carcinogenic. Reducing bacon consumption and increasing plant food consumption may reduce cancer risk in part because plants tend to have significantly more antioxidants than animal products such as bacon.	-	meat,mortality,fiber,heart disease,heart health,cardiovascular disease,vegetables,cardiovascular health,cancer,beans,plant-based diets,grains,hot dogs,fruit,ham	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/23/the-five-most-important-dietary-tweaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/08/eat-protect-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/27/hives-from-tick-bite-induced-meat-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/22/how-a-low-carb-diet-is-metabolically-like-being-obese/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/22/the-effects-of-dietary-cholesterol-on-blood-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/23/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/14/how-the-meat-industry-designed-a-highly-misleading-study/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-cancer-does-lunch-meat-cause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-industry-reaction-new-cancer-guidelines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-the-egg-board-designs-misleading-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tick-bites-meat-allergies-and-chronic-urticaria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bacon-good-or-is-spinach-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-garlic-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-brain-loss-with-b-vitamins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flesh-and-fructose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-palatability-of-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-reverse-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-make-your-own-fruit-and-vegetable-wash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-c-enriched-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-more-to-weigh-less/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-spillover-effect-links-obesity-to-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-percent-of-americans-lead-healthy-lifestyles/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-a-sugary-grave/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-c-enriched-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bacon-good-or-is-spinach-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-a-sugary-grave/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-garlic-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flesh-and-fructose/	
T-191	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bananas/	bananas	Bananas Bananas are a good source of fiber, which improves the quality of bowel movements, feeds our beneficial gut bacteria and facilitates the absorbance of some dietary components, including calcium. The vitamin B6 found in bananas may support eye health and alleviate dry eye symptoms. These widely consumed fruits are also rich in serotonin, the neurotransmitter responsible for regulating mood, and may prove capable of modulating or preventing depression symptoms. A study performed in vitro showed liver cancer cells growth rate decreasing 40% after exposure to bananas. However, increased intake of bananas was not associated with a decreased risk of developing breast cancer in a study of African American women. Long-term, regular consumption of bananas does, however, appear to help stabilize blood sugar levels.Compared to other fruits, bananas are poor sources of phytonutrients, like the eye-protecting zeaxanthin, which may be why they do not appear to be protective against glaucoma. They are also relatively low in antioxidants, and even elicit significantly smaller decreases in inflammatory markers after ingestion, compared to other fruits (see also here).While bananas do contain potassium, they appear relatively low on the list of best sources of this essential mineral, coming in in 86th place, behind fast food milk shakes. The actual best sources: leafy greens, beans and dates. These statistics should not discourage you from eating bananas; as part of a balanced, varied diet, consuming bananas is healthy (but berries and most other fruits may be healthier).	-	fruit,vegetables,fruit juice,berries,greens,apples,phytonutrients,women's health,fat,antioxidants,apple juice,oranges,sugar,junk food,cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/10/which-common-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/12/saffron-vs-prozac-for-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/10/coffee-caveats/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-skin-cancer-from-the-inside-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-raisins-cause-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liquid-calories-do-smoothies-lead-to-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-smoothies-what-does-the-science-say/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mood,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/zeaxanthin,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=greens,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=B6,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/calcium,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eye-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=potassium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/glaucoma,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-smoothies-what-does-the-science-say/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=dates,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	
T-201	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/	beans	Beans are rich in phytonutrients and antioxidants and are an excellent addition to a varied, economical, healthy diet. All four of the major dietary food-scoring systems promote beans as a part of a healthy diet, one of only four foods these guidelines agree on. The newest dietary guidelines for Americans also promote whole plant food consumption, including a high legume intake.Many of the most health-promoting and disease-reversing diets ever studied emphasize high bean and legume consumption:Beans contain a multitude of nutrients that are known to be health-promoting:Bean consumption appears to play a role in the following:In fact, beans are so health promoting that their consumption is now believed to be the single most important predictor of longevity among older populations around the world.Black beans appear to be slightly more antioxidant-rich than pinto beans. Lentils (red lentils more than than green ones) come in second after black beans for antioxidant content. Tempeh is a whole soybean food and as such is one of the healthiest forms of soy.There appears to be little difference in nutrient profiles among cooked, sprouted and canned beans, but some canned beans may contain up to one hundred times more salt than beans prepared at home. One should also be aware that the plastic linings in bean cans produced by certain companies contain BPA.Unfortunately, 98% of Americans are not utilizing the full potential of these versatile, cost-effective, environmentally friendly foods. Public health and economic policies could do more to promote the consumption of healthy foods. It’s never too late to accrue health benefits from switching to a healthier diet and lifestyle.	-	vegetarians,vegetables,vegans,meat,fruit,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,cardiovascular

T-202	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beef/	beef	Animal muscle including beef naturally contains significant amounts of saturated fats, trans-fats and cholesterol, all of which increase our risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Saturated fat may also play an important role in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Beef has been considered richer in fat and cholesterol than other meat, but switching to eating chicken and fish does not lower cholesterol. All meat contains sex hormones, which may contribute to menstrual cycle irregularities and infertility, and arachidonic acid, a biologically active metabolite which plays an important role in inflammatory processes and may have an impact on mood regulation. Spermine, another biologically active metabolite, may promote weight gain.Why are Americans still consuming such large volumes of beef and other meat products? One reason may be that many Americans are unaware of the effects of beef on human health, to no small extent because that is the way the beef industry wants it.	-	animal products,plant-based diets,milk,meat,dairy,cancer,eggs,vegetarians,mortality,vegetables,pork,fiber,vegans,fruit,diabetes	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/08/eat-protect-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/28/white-meat-may-be-as-cholesterol-raising-as-red/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/08/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-help-reduce-brain-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/15/superbugs-on-retail-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/16/comparing-vegans-arteries-to-runners/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-best-lowers-phthalate-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-mgus-and-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arteries-of-vegans-vs-runners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-milk-infectious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-corporate-guidance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-type-of-protein-is-better-for-our-kidneys/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resistant-starch-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-consumption-and-the-development-of-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superbugs-in-conventional-vs-organic-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-mans-diet-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arachidonic-acid,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-corporate-guidance/

It may also be the most hydrating of alcoholic beverages, leaving the body with more water than it started with, whereas wine has a dehydrating effect.With regard to women’s health, beer-drinking females have better bone density than non-drinkers.  Hops phytoestrogen in beer may also help relieve menopausal discomfort including hot flashes. However, beer may be more carcinogenic to the breast than other forms of alcohol.Some other ingredients in beer may contribute to cancer, including certain artificial caramel colorings and putrescine.	-	beverages,alcohol,cancer,fruit,carcinogens,meat,cardiovascular disease,vegetables,heart disease,industry influence,dairy,exercise,women's health,animal products,fish	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/28/breast-cancer-alcohol-how-much-is-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/13/does-caramel-color-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-most-potent-phytoestrogen-is-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogenic-putrescine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fill-in-the-blank/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-and-benefits-of-sensible-sun-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/would-taxing-unhealthy-foods-improve-public-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benzene-in-carrot-juice/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/wine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/standard-american-diet,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beverages,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/putrescine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens	
T-208	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beets/	beets	Beets are very high in dietary nitrates, which may enhance athletic performance and increase blood flow. This is not only beneficial for athletes, but also in patients suffering from illnesses that affect circulation and tissue oxygenation: patients with high blood pressure, emphysema, and peripheral artery disease saw improvements in their symptoms with beet juice supplementation. Beets may also improve blood flow through the brain, particularly the frontal lobes, which may protect against age-associated dementia. Considering their vasodilatory effects, beets may likely be useful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.How do nitrates from the beet juice work? When mixed with our saliva, bacteria in our mouths convert dietary nitrates into nitrites, which can then converted to nitric oxide. This nitric oxide is what improves cellular respiration.In addition to their nitrate content, beets are also good sources of antioxidants and are one of the few vegetables that do not lose any antioxidant power through a variety of cooking methods. They have also been shown to decrease the growth rates cancer cells in vitro. Beets also bind and remove bile-acids in the colon, which are associated with premature degenerative diseases.Are there any downsides to eating beets? Beets are unsuitable for infants to consume and they may promote oxalate kidney stones in patients predisposed to their formation. For the majority of the population, though, beet consumption is safe, with the only side-effect being a portion of people passing harmless, pink urine.	-	vegetables,nitrates,heart disease,cardiovascular health,heart health,cardiovascular disease,greens,women's health,exercise,fruit,hypertension,blood pressure,nitric oxide,beet juice,high blood pressure	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/03/stool-size-and-breast-cancer-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/29/bowel-movements-the-scoop-on-poop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-to-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxygenating-blood-with-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fill-in-the-blank/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whole-beets-vs-juice-for-improving-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slowing-metabolism-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veg-table-dietary-nitrate-scoring-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-use-antiseptic-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibacterial-toothpaste-harmful-helpful-or-harmless/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pretty-in-pee-nk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/out-of-the-lab-onto-the-track/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hearts-shouldnt-skip-a-beet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-get-vitamin-d-sun-supplements-or-salons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/priming-the-proton-pump/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/neurobiology-of-artificial-sweeteners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=high+blood+pressure,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxygenating-blood-with-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whole-beets-vs-juice-for-improving-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=nitrate,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=erectile+dysfunction,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-use-antiseptic-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pretty-in-pee-nk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=nitrite,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hearts-shouldnt-skip-a-beet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/priming-the-proton-pump/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=emphysema,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=peripherial+artery+disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=nitric+oxide,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=dementia,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/	
T-211	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bell-peppers/	bell peppers	Consuming bell peppers along with other vegetables on a daily basis may help lower cardiovascular disease and cancer risks and improve health. Bell peppers contain nicotine, which may help protect against Parkinson’s Disease. Numerous studies have been conducted to measure the antioxidant power of various fruits and vegetables. Those studies utilized a chemical-measuring approach, except one.  Cornell University studied the cellular antioxidant activity of vegetables—a biological quantification of the antioxidant power—and found that beets, red bell pepper and eggplant were the top three contenders.Bell peppers are best eaten raw for maximum nutritional value: cooking them can lead to antioxidant loss.	-	vegetables,broccoli,phytonutrients,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,heart health,vitamin C,fruit,cancer,greens,cardiovascular health,oxidative stress,supplements,antioxidants,beets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/03/foods-with-natural-melatonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-wrinkles-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-chocolate-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppers-and-parkinsons-the-benefits-of-smoking-without-the-risks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-canned-fruit-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/	
T-219	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries/	berries	Berries may be helpful in the prevention of chronic disease, including cancer and heart disease. Fruits in general, and berries in particular, have the ability to suppress cancer cell growth in vitro and to reduce DNA damage induced by mutagenic agents present in cooked meat. Strawberries and raspberries can reverse precancerous oral or esophageal lesions. This anti-cancer activity occurs through mechanisms going from boosting natural killer cell activity to inhibiting angiogenesis. Though berries do not seem to lower cholesterol, they may reduce heart disease risk by keeping our platelets in an inactivated state.Berries have the greatest antioxidant content per serving compared to any other food except spices. Blackberries, Indian gooseberries, and goji berries rank among the highest in terms of antioxidant levels and offer one of the best nutrition bangs for our buck. Antioxidant-rich foods can affect nitric oxide activity, which helps our arteries relax and dilate normally, and can increase stool weight. Berry antioxidants appear to survive processing, but eating berries in the presence of dairy products may suppress their antioxidant effects. Antioxidant intake may also be associated with lower lymphoma and gastric cancer risks.Whole fruits and vegetables, but not antioxidant pills, may be useful in treating seasonal allergies and asthma. Berries may even help slow the progression of our third leading killer COPD (emphysema).Consumption of blueberries and strawberries has a protective effect on brain function, delaying cognitive decline by as much as 2.5 years and improving sleep quality due to their melatonin content. Blueberries also have been shown to improve memory.Other remarkable effects include enhanced athletic recovery and reduced muscle soreness, preventing Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and GERD acid reflux heartburn, and relief from visual fatigue. Cranberries in particular may reduce dental plaque formation and prevent recurring bladder infections. Açai berries may promote immune function and relieve arthritic pain.Organic berries appear preferable. And the more berries we eat, the more benefit you derive. Indian gooseberries may be effective in treating diabetes, cancer cell growth and invasion, but avoid Ayurvedic preparations such as triphala, because of heavy metal contamination. Rosehips have been found to reduce osteoarthritis pain.Berries do not create an insulin spike even though they contain a lot of fructose, and fructose does not have the same harmful effects as high fructose corn syrup or table sugar. So remember to include berries in your diet–they are so very healthy and economical.	-	cancer,meat,phytonutrients,antioxidants,chronic diseases,fruit,vegetables,animal

Subjects suffering from asthma had lower circulating carotenoid levels; adding a few servings of fruits and vegetables to the diet reduced asthma exacerbation rate by half. Antioxidants like beta-carotene and vitamin C taken from diet could also help prevent bacterial vaginosis. To get the most nutrients from carotenoid-rich vegetables, cooking matters: the best way to cook sweet potatoes would be to boil them with their skin, which is ten times as rich in antioxidants as the flesh.	-	phytonutrients,cancer,carrots,antioxidants,vegetables,fruit,supplements,cardiovascular health,heart health,chronic diseases,diabetes,alpha-carotene,tomatoes,sweet potatoes,greens	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/22/preventing-and-treating-colon-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/23/preventing-bacterial-vaginosis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/28/fighting-inflammation-with-food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/24/is-it-better-to-bake-boil-or-steam-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/02/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-treat-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/19/preserving-vision-through-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vit-d-supplements-help-diabetes-weight-loss-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pharmacists-versus-health-food-store-employees-who-gives-better-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-vitamin-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pretty-in-pee-nk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-dietary-supplements-may-be-more-than-a-waste-of-money/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industry-response-to-plants-not-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacterial-vaginosis-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/produce-not-pills-to-increase-physical-attractiveness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fiber-vs-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-canned-fruit-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-vitamin-d-the-new-vitamin-e/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lung-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacterial-vaginosis-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asthma,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-C	
T-225	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beverages/	beverages	The new dietary guidelines and other studies on healthy beverages show that beverages can be a rich source of nutrients in the diet. In Asia, for example, green tea consumption may help explain comparatively low lung cancer and heart disease rates given the level of smoking. Green tea may also aid in stopping the malignant transformation of cultured breast cells and may even help prevent cavities. But, drinking too much green tea may pose the potential risk of dental fluorosis in children. Tea is a great low calorie source of nutrients that may also help modulate brain activity. Healthy herbal teas include tulsi, osmanthus, dandelion, and hibiscus, which may elevate antioxidant levels in the bloodstream within an hour, but some liquid supplements containing tropical fruit juices such as noni and mangosteen may be toxic to the liver.Cold water steeping of tea may lead to higher nutrient concentrations. Matcha tea (made from powdered tea leaves) is an excellent option. Avoid adding milk to tea to maximize nutrient absorption. 10 cups of tea a day is probably the safe upper limit. Here are some other interesting comparisons: earl gray vs. black tea, green vs. white tea, coffee vs. tea, and bottled vs. tap water.Even light alcohol intake (up to a drink a day) is suspected to promote breast cancer.We may not be drinking enough fluids, evidenced by the fact that drinking water was found to boost children’s’ cognitive performance. Women should drink four to seven cups of water a day and men should drink six to eleven.Coffee has also been shown to be relatively health promoting, though there are concerns about its effect on coronary artery function, although it may help prevent liver cancer. Beet juice has been found to significantly Beet juice has been found to significantly improve athletic performance. Soymilk positively influences timing of puberty in girls and appears equal to cow’s milk in terms of calcium absorption (as long as you shake it). Drinks to minimize include kombucha tea, yerba mate, noni juice, dairy, commercial carrot juice, artificially sweetened beverages, and soda, which may contain sodium benzoate and caramel coloring which may contribute to cancer risk. The media often bombards us with messages about what we should or shouldn’t eat or drink so awareness of the source of funding and how it impacts the results of scientific findings is important.Smoothies may maximize nutrient absorption without risking overly rapid sugar absorption.

T-238	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/biomagnification/	biomagnification	Biomagnification refers to the concentration of toxins in an organism as a result of its ingesting other plants or animals in which the toxins are more widely disbursed. Biomagnification is one way humans are exposed to dangerous pollutants and other toxins: contaminants may accumulate in the fat of animals, and humans are exposed to the contaminants when they eat the animal products. The highest levels of toxins are found in fatty fish like salmon, with farmed Atlantic salmon appearing to be the single largest source. Consuming a plant-based diet and decreasing or eliminating meat, dairy, and fish intake may significantly reduce exposure.One example of biomagnification relates to the BMAA neurotoxin, which may contribute to ALS, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. BMAA is produced by blue-green algae in many rivers, lakes, and oceans, ends up in seafood, and is passed along to humans who eat the seafood.  Another example is endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants such as alkylphenols, which may increase cancer cell growth. Pollutants can come down in the rain and then accumulate up the food chain. Even small molecules from medications like Benadryl, Cardizem, Tegretol, Lopid, Zoloft, and Prozac—excreted in urine and ending up in rivers and streams—are found in fish consumed by humans. Toxins like arsenic, lead, mercury, dioxins, PCBs, and even DDT (banned decades ago) have bioaccumulated in seafood, poultry, dairy, eggs, and other animal products and pose threats to human health.Cooking does not destroy the toxins or drugs that have bioaccumulated in food.The USDA, FDA, and EPA are supposed to test for these contaminants, but the Inspector General found that the national residue program is not accomplishing its mission of monitoring the food supply for harmful residues.	-	persistent organic pollutants,fish,industrial pollutants,seafood,animal fat,animal products,chicken,body fat,dairy,women's health,poultry,plant-based diets,vegetarians,meat,vegans	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/11/salmon-may-be-the-greatest-source-of-dietary-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/21/foods-linked-to-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prozac-residues-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alkylphenols/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/salmon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lead,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/usda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/epa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bmaa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arsenic,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ddt/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/	
T-242	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/birth-defects/	birth defects	A woman’s diet, even pre-pregnancy, may have a major impact on their children’s health. A mother’s consumption of high fat dairy may be associated with double the odds of an infant developing the birth defect, hypospadias. Nitrites found in processed meat, advanced glycation end products and heme iron all were found to increase risks for gestational diabetes, itself linked to a higher occurrence of birth defects. Contamination with methylmercury in seafood can lead to impaired fetal brain development and is a risk factor for epilepsy. The brain-boosting omega-3 fatty acids in fish cannot compensate for the risk of neurological damage due to the presence of mercury. Other pollutants, like alkylphenols found in meat, dairy and seafood, are endocrine disruptors linked to increased risk of birth defects and infertility, as well as of eczema, seasonal allergies and metabolic diseases. The carcinogen DES was once fed to farm animals, a practice that has since been banned.	-	women's health,meat,cancer,pregnancy,animal fat,fish,dairy,chicken,plant-based diets,infants,animal products,men's health,children,poultry,reproductive health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/26/how-to-protect-our-telomeres-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/26/why-are-chickens-fed-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-associated-with-brain-shrinkage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-best-lowers-phthalate-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-folic-acid-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-meat-can-be-a-lifesaver/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/using-the-produce-aisle-to-boost-immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-associated-with-brain-shrinkage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eczema/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alkylphenols/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/seafood,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nitrite/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/advanced-glycation-end-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/	
T-246	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/black-tea/	black tea	Tea, including black tea, may be the healthiest beverage to order on an airplane. Some concern was raised over the aluminum content of black tea: five cups/day contain the equivalent of the maximum recommended aluminum intake. But aluminum from black tea is bound to phytonutrients and thus its bioavailability is low, so that no more than 10% can get absorbed. Black tea failed to increase aluminum blood levels, even when taken with lemon. Due to fluoride levels, we may not want to drink more than ten cups of tea a day, and adding soymilk to our tea may block the beneficial vascular effects of black tea.White, green, oolong, and black tea all come from the same plants, but differ in how they are processed. Green tea and hibiscus have more antioxidants than black tea, but if you love black tea, Earl Grey tea may be healthier than plain black tea due to the added bergamot oil. Black tea has similar hydrating effects as water.	-	green tea,tea,beverages,safety limits,water,oolong tea,cancer,lemons,herbal tea,hibiscus tea,kidney failure,caffeine,heavy metals,fish,matcha	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/17/aluminum-levels-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/14/does-liquid-smoke-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-tea-vs-earl-grey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tea-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soymilk-suppression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-vs-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-tea-vs-white/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-tea-vs-earl-grey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soymilk-suppression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aluminum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oolong-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/green-tea	
T-255	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-clots/	blood clots	Blood clotting is healthy and necessary when it stops unwanted bleeding, but blood clots can form inside arteries, blood vessels, or the heart. If a clot travels to the heart or lungs, it could become dangerous.Platelets play an important role in the clotting of our blood as well as the inflammatory process that brings additional aid to an injury site. But it is important to suppress the over-activity of platelets to avoid internal blood clots and the type of unwanted inflammation that can support heart disease, cancer, and other inflammatory diseases. To reduce risk of blood clots, it is important to consume foods that suppress platelet activation. Garlic, tomatoes and berries may help with anti-platelet activation.   	-	cardiovascular health,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,heart health,stroke,cancer,aging,mortality,vegetables,fruit,lifespan,cholesterol,side effects,inflammation,supplements	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/28/inhibiting-platelet-activation-tomato-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/12/how-grapefruit-affects-prescription-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/02/the-number-one-global-diet-risk/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-tomato-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fatty-meals-may-impair-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-and-onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-flax-seeds-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-aggregation-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tomatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/garlic/	
T-257	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-pressure/	blood pressure	High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, may be the #1 risk factor for death in the world, as it is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, heart attacks, kidney disease, stroke, blindness and possibly Alzheimer’s disease. Nearly one in three adults suffers from high blood pressure, and by the time Americans reach 60, nearly half have high blood pressure.Meat and sugar increase uric acid levels, which are associated with an increased risk for high blood pressure. Salt intake and industrially-manufactured fructose (added sugars) may also be linked to high blood pressure. Interestingly, the fructose found in up to 20 servings of whole fruit daily does not appear to raise blood pressure.In one study of rural Kenyans, the traditional diet of whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafy vegetables resulted in not a single case of arteriosclerosis among 1,800 individuals.Among rural Chinese residents who adhered to a traditional plant-based diet, blood pressures of 110 over 70 were the norm for teenagers as well as seniors in their 70s, defying the oft-held belief that blood pressures rise as a result of normal aging.The largest ever study of diet and blood pressure risk involving 89,000 Californians found a drop in blood pressure, along with diabetes and obesity rates, that correlated with volume of plant foods consumed. Simply removing meat from the diet can lower blood pressure in just seven days, without medication.Attempting to reduce high blood pressure with medications may not be as effective as lifestyle approaches, as medications do not treat the underlying cause. Even those already on blood pressure-lowering drugs can gain a further 78% drop in risk by eating and living healthfully.In the 1940s, Dr. Walter Kempner at Duke University was able to reduce his patients’ high blood pressure with a low-salt, low-protein diet consisting of white rice and fruit. The doctor successfully treated over 18,000 individuals using this all but forgotten intervention that was equal to or more effective than modern high blood pressure drugs. Despite his success, many physicians today fail to prescribe dietary changes to lower high blood pressure among their patients.Sadly, while there are now hundreds of blood pressure drugs on the market, high blood pressure remains the #1 cause of death and disability in the world, killing nine million people a year.A range of research into specific foods or beverages that may help reduce high blood pressure includes beans and other legumes, whole grains, beets, beet juice, cocoa, flaxseeds, greens, hibiscus tea, purple potatoes and the seaweed wakame.	-	high blood pressure,hypertension,plant-based diets,meat,heart disease,heart health,cholesterol,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,vegetarians,vegans,vegetables,fruit,diabetes,mortality	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/06/do-you-meet-the-simple-seven/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/23/can-you-eat-too-much-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/13/whats-the-optimal-cholesterol-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/08/eat-protect-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/01/flax-seeds-can-have-profound-effect-on-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/worth-switching-white-rice-brown/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drugs-and-the-demise-of-the-rice-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-diet-may-affect-stress-responses-in-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-evidence-that-salt-raises-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hibiscus-tea-vs-plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vit-d-supplements-help-diabetes-weight-loss-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-brain-food-older-adults/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-dha-supplements-to-boost-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-miso-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kempner-rice-diet-whipping-us-into-shape/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taking-personal-responsibility-for-your-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diet-studies-show-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxygenating-blood-with-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-optimal-dose-of-vitamin-d-based-on-natural-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-strengthen-the-mind-body-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/high-blood-pressure-may-be-a-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reductionism-deficiency-mentality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-get-vitamin-d-sun-supplements-or-salons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sprinkling-doubt-taking-sodium-skeptics-with-a-pinch-of-salt/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sodium-and-arterial-function-a-salting-our-endothelium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/flaxseeds,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-walter-kempner/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/hibiscus-tea,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/salt,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/beets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/whole-grains,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-blood-pressure	
T-258	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-sugar/	blood sugar	Diabetes is one of the biggest health issues in America, contributing to the leading causes of death heart disease, stroke and cancer. Fortunately, research continues to show that a plant-based diet and lifestyle changes may be the optimal solution for improving the symptoms of diabetes.Diabetes is caused by insulin resistance in our bodies, which is thought to be caused by lipotoxicity, a consequence of the accumulation of fat within our muscle cells. As dietary fat bloats our adipose cells, fat spills over into the bloodstream and gets into our muscle cells, while simultaneously promoting insulin resistance and raising blood sugar levels. Diabetes is also associated with metabolic syndrome, a medical disorder characterized by abdominal obesity, high fasting sugars, high triglycerides, and high blood pressure.A plant-based diet is recommended in a review published by Kaiser Permanente to help improve many chronic diseases including diabetes. Plants may even be more effective than pharmaceutical drugs in preventing diabetes. Whole grains and fiber-rich foods work best in regulating blood sugar levels, lowering cholesterol, weight, and increasing satiety. The daily consumption of foods such as oatmeal, beans (also see here), tea, nuts, flaxseed, acai berries, amla, vinegar, and cinnamon may improve signs and symptoms associated with diabetes.There are also foods to avoid when treating and preventing diabetes. Fruit juices (but not whole fruit), poultry and fish increase uric acid levels within the body and may put an individual at risk for diabetes including gestational diabetes.	-	diabetes,sugar,insulin,weight loss,heart disease,prediabetes,inflammation,cardiovascular disease,fruit,heart health,cardiovascular

T-262	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blue-green-algae/	blue-green algae	Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a type of bacteria that are found in soil, lakes, and oceans all over the world. Like plants, they can use sunlight to grow. Animals and fish ingest cyanobacteria, and then enter our food supply when we consume animals, fish, and shellfish.Blue-green algae are used in supplements claiming nutritional value and health benefits. However, the potential neurotoxicity of blue-green algae supplements may pose a health concern.Almost all blue-green algae can produce neurotoxins. One of these neurotoxins is BMAA, an amino acid which increases the risks of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system. BMAA is found throughout the world. Aquatic animals, such as fish and shellfish, contain high concentrations of BMAA.In fact, researchers found BMAA in the brains of Canadian patients with Alzheimer’s. In 2009, further research through a study done in Miami revealed that BMAA was also found in the brains of Floridians with Alzheimer’s, Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS), and those dying from Parkinson’s disease. Exposure to BMAA through eating fish and seafood was considered a possible source of the toxin. High levels of BMAA were found in Florida fish and seafood.Spirulina is a type of blue-green algae. While health claims for spirulina supplements abound, there is cause for concern. These supplements were found to contain liver toxins and neurotoxins. In fact, in 2009, a potent neurotoxin was found in spirulina.Although the U. S. Pharmacopeia’s safety evaluation of spirulina concludes that “the available evidence does not indicate a serious risk to health or other public health concern when spirulina is properly identified, formulated, and used,” consumers should be advised to choose spirulina supplements with third party testing. Researchers reported a range of adverse reactions but attributed them to other algae toxins within the spirulina.Chlorella is unicellular freshwater green algae sold as powder or compressed into tablets. It does not have the toxins that may be present in blue-green algae or spirulina supplements. Although some adverse reactions have been reported in sensitive individuals, they were not due to toxins. For the vast majority of people, chlorella can be considered helpful.Chlorella supplementation may increase immunity. For example, chlorella supplementation appeared to prevent loss in immune function in athletes in training camp who experienced intense physical activity and group living. Athletes given a daily dose of chlorella did not experience a drop in immune function as did those who did not receive it. Another study by the World Journal of Gastroenerology was done to test the efficacy of chlorella supplementation in adults with chronic hepatitis C infection. Researchers found a significant improvement in ALT, a marker of liver inflammation, which could be explained by a beneficial immunostimulatory effect of chlorella supplementation.Topic summary contributed by Mimi. 	-	supplements,neurotoxins,nutrition myths,spirulina,brain health,health food stores,alternative medicine,complementary medicine,Alzheimer’s disease,ALS,algae,Lou Gehrig's disease,brain disease,BMAA,Parkinson's disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/29/toxin-contamination-of-spirulina-supplements/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blue-green-algae-spirulina/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hepatitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/neurotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bmaa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chlorella/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/algae,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/spirulina/	
T-263	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blueberries/	blueberries	Blueberries are among the healthiest fruits. Although there are foods with more antioxidants, blueberries have a very high antioxidant value, which can help in reaching the recommended daily intake and staying out of oxidative debt.Whole fresh blueberries have a higher phytonutrient content than dried blueberries and juice. These phytonutrients have been shown to improve memory, delay cognitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease and protect against age-related macular degeneration. Blueberries may lower cancer risk, notably by increasing our cancer fighting immune cells. The fructose in blueberries and other fruits is not harmful like high fructose corn syrup or table sugar.Use blueberries in this delicious antioxidant-rich breakfast smoothie.	-	vegetables,fruit,fiber,berries,antioxidants,diabetes,phytonutrients,sugar,apples,strawberries,cancer,inflammation,milk,grapes,fat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/21/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/23/can-you-eat-too-much-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/05/how-to-suppress-the-aging-enzyme-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/27/how-may-eating-plants-help-prevent-alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/24/is-it-better-to-bake-boil-or-steam-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/07/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/08/currant-treatment-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/23/boosting-anti-cancer-immunity-with-berries/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vinegar-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-nutrition-so-commercialized/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/neurobiology-of-artificial-sweeteners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liquid-calories-do-smoothies-lead-to-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-fruits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-memory-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-fruits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-fructose-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-memory-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	
T-266	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/body-fat/	body fat	Abdominal fat is the kind of body fat that may most increases our risk of dying prematurely, making waist-to-height ratio a better predictor of disease than body mass index. Those eating plant-based diets may have a faster metabolism and burn more calories. When activated by cold temperatures or eating arginine-rich or spicy foods, brown adipose tissue may burn body fat. Given otherwise comparable diets, the protein in soy may cause abdominal fat to shrink 10-15 square centimeters, whereas the protein in milk may cause abdominal fat to increase 20-40 square centimeters. Soy appears to prevent human fat cells from taking up fat, and turmeric is also thought to have this effect on fat cells. Bean consumption has also been associated with lower body weights and smaller waist circumferences in adults. Eating grapefruit may lead to weight loss, and drinking water before each meal could have the same effect. Dried fruits and nuts do not appear to lead to weight gain despite their caloric density and eating frequency does not seem to have an impact on health and weight. Cocoa itself (like in cocoa powder) does not cause weight gain, but the sugar and fat added to chocolate may lead to weight gain. Smoothies can be just as filling as eating whole fruits and vegetables (and leading to less caloric intake overall) as long as we drink them slowly. Conversely, meat has been associated with higher weight gain, even after controlling for calories, and may be specifically associated with abdominal obesity. It has been estimated that, on average, an inch is added onto the waist for every daily burger consumed over time. People consuming low calorie sweeteners such as those found in diet soda may overcompensate by eating more than they should, which can also lead to weight gain. Because a plant-based diet is associated with a lower body fat, it might also help reduce cellulite.A virus has been discovered that actually causes obesity in chickens. Such viruses may even be a contributing factor in human obesity by increasing the number and size of fat cells. Chicken meat today contains ten times more fat per serving compared to chicken meat a hundred years ago, This could help explain why chicken has been tied to human abdominal girth.Dioxins are toxic waste pollutants that accumulate in the fatty tissues of food animals consumed by humans. PCBs (found in fish oil) have been found to induce inflammation that promotes obesity.

T-275	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bone-health/	bone health	The idea that the acid-forming quality of animal protein has to be buffered by calcium from the bones, thus leading to bone loss, might not be true. However, despite the fact that milk-drinkers have a higher calcium intake, long-term vegans were found to have the same bone mineral density. The galactose in milk may explain why milk consumption is associated with significantly higher risk of hip fractures, cancer, and premature death. Still, vegans not getting enough calcium may be at higher risk of bone fractures, making the consumption of plant-based sources of calcium, such as broccoli and kale, important. Calcium absorption from soy milk was found to be the same as cow’s milk, but soy milk needs to be shaken since the calcium tends to settle at the bottom. Cow’s milk consumption has been found to increase the risk of death and bone fractures, thought to be due to the galactose content. Low levels of testosterone may also lead to loss of bone density. Daily coffee consumption may lead to a slight increase in bone fracture risk in women, but a lower risk in men.While calcium is important for bone health, fiber and high-phytate foods such as whole grains, beans, and nuts, may also play a role in improving bone mineral density. Moreover, Vitamin D is important for bone health and for the proper functioning of many other organs. Curcumin (found in turmeric) may alleviate the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis without the side effects associated with drugs. Conversely, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are found in some processed foods and produced by some forms of cooking, may accelerate the aging process and increase risk of osteoporosis.	-	cancer,bone fractures,milk,heart disease,vitamin D supplements,cardiovascular disease,dairy,cardiovascular health,supplements,exercise,heart health,soy,protein,blood pressure,sunlight	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/26/peeks-behind-the-egg-industry-curtain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/31/why-is-milk-consumption-associated-with-more-bone-fractures/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/14/what-do-meat-purge-and-cola-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/27/the-spice-that-helps-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/20/how-beans-help-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/11/exploiting-autophagy-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/18/the-vitamin-everyone-on-a-plant-based-diet-needs/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/glycotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-beans-theyre-good-for-your-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-great-protein-fiasco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vit-d-supplements-help-diabetes-weight-loss-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-good-for-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sodium-skeptics-try-to-shake-up-the-salt-debate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-we-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vitamin-d-supplements-be-taken-to-prevent-falls/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-and-benefits-of-sensible-sun-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/could-lactose-explain-the-milk-and-parkinsons-disease-link/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-optimal-dose-of-vitamin-d-based-on-natural-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-and-mortality-may-be-a-u-shaped-curve/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-the-institute-of-medicine-arrived-at-their-vitamin-d-recommendation/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/glycotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-good-for-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/osteoporosis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/calcium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-and-mortality-may-be-a-u-shaped-curve/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-the-institute-of-medicine-arrived-at-their-vitamin-d-recommendation/	
T-283	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bowel-movements/	bowel movements	The form, frequency, and transit time of bowel movements may play an important role in colon health. Those with lower fecal pH (from a diet high in fiber) have less risk of developing colorectal cancer. Larger bowel movements rid the body of excess estrogen and excess bile. Women who have more frequent bowel movements appear to be at lower risk of breast cancer, which may be because bile acids absorbed from our intestines concentrate in the breast and have an estrogen-like tumor promoting effect. A minimum of 200 grams of fecal output (about a half pound) per day is the goal for cancer prevention. The healthy bacteria in our colon may even help us control our weight, so it’s important to keep our gut flora happy.Fiber from whole foods can prevent diverticulosis, constipation, and hiatal hernias, heartburn, GERD. High fiber diets such as traditional plant-based diets can lead to two to three healthy bowel movements each day, and with enough fiber, one should be able to sit in any position and have a comfortable bowel movement. Prunes were found to be more effective than fiber supplements in increasing spontaneous bowel movements. Foods high in antioxidants may also help increase stool size. Moreover, the elimination of all dairy products may cure almost all cases of childhood constipation. Eating meat and processed foods may increase one’s risk for conditions such as diverticulosis. Fat blocking drugs and certain fish can cause anal leakage.	-	fiber,colon health,plant-based diets,vegetarians,colon disease,vegans,standard American diet,Africa,microbiome,gut flora,constipation,stool size,phytonutrients,women's health,cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/07/how-probiotics-affect-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/03/stool-size-and-breast-cancer-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/17/prunes-metamucil-or-a-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/29/bowel-movements-the-scoop-on-poop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/11/a-simple-yet-neglected-cure-for-childhood-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/14/bile-acids-and-breast-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-hiatal-hernia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-movement-frequency/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-constipation-and-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-bowel-movements-should-you-have-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diverticulosis-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/milk-protein-vs-soy-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greasy-orange-rectal-leakage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/diverticulosis-nuts/#_blank,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-hiatal-hernia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/greasy-orange-rectal-leakage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/bowel-movement-frequency/#_blank,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-constipation-and-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-bowel-movements-should-you-have-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/bristol-stool-scale/#_blank,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/milk-protein-vs-soy-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	
T-289	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-disease/	brain disease	Lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet, physical exercise, and mental exercise could play an important role in the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (see also here). A Mediterranean diet may not only reduce risk of Alzheimer’s, but may also reduce mortality from the disease. Different fruits and vegetables appear to support different cognitive domains of the brain, so both variety and quantity in the diet are important. Greater fruit and vegetable consumption has been linked with lower rates of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The consumption of blueberries and strawberries is associated with delayed cognitive aging by as much as 2.5 years. Ellagic acid may play a role in the ability of berries to prevent age related cognitive decline, but its absorption is blocked by dairy.The relationship between tofu and dementia may be related to formaldehyde contamination. Apple juice did not appear to increase cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s patients, even though in a petri dish, apple juice and ginger appeared to improve nerve cell survival. However, it has been found that those who drink fruit and vegetable juices had a 76% lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s, possibly due to phytonutrient content. Saffron, when compared to Aricept, a leading drug in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, was found to work just as well without the side effects (see also here). While populations eating more turmeric have a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s, this may be due to their lower consumption of meat, which is also beneficial for Parkinson’s disease. However, turmeric, but not curcumin supplements, was found to alleviate Alzheimer patients’ symptoms. Coffee may also reduce the risk of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Conversely, there is little evidence that coconut oil helps with Alzheimer’s disease. Aluminum is added to processed cheese and may be related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Similarly, iron accumulation in the brain is being increasingly linked to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s, glycotoxins (found mostly in chicken) may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and BMAA, a neurotoxin found in seafood may also be linked with higher rates of neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, there’s been a recommendation that people with a family history of neurodegenerative diseases should avoid milk. Toxic waste in the food supply may help explain the link between dairy consumption and Parkinson’s disease (see also here). Skim milk has been found to have especially high levels of hormones. There may be a simple, cheap, non-invasive test for detection of Alzheimer’s disease.Consumption of methyl mercury can result in microcephaly, impaired cognition, and delayed brain-nerve communication in fetuses, infants, and children. Mercury contamination has also been linked to lower IQs and brain damage in the children of mothers who ingest mercury while pregnant. Women may want to avoid polluted fish consumption for a year before they get pregnant in addition to just during pregnancy. Methyl mercury is found in tuna and fish (see here, here and here). Ayurvedic medications have also been found to be contaminated with mercury and lead. Arsenic is fed to chickens and may be related to neuropathy as well as neurocognitive deficits in children. Getting bitewing or panoramic X-rays at the dentist may be associated with an increased risk of meningioma, the most common type of brain tumor. Dehydration may impair cognitive functions.Pork tapeworms larvae invading the brain is one of the most common causes of epilepsy (see also here), and may present as migraines or chronic tension headaches. The brain parasite toxoplasma is found in lambs; 10% of Americans are currently infected with this parasite. There are also migratory skin worms from sushi consumption that may get into the brain. Neurotoxic chemicals in chicken, including beta-carboline alkaloids, may also explain the link between meat consumption and the common neurological disorder essential tremor. There are neurotoxins in fish that cannot be neutralized with cooking and can cause strange reactions (like hot feels like cold, cold feels hot). Similarly, domoic acid, found in seafood, has been found to cause an unusual form of amnesia.Aspirin naturally found in plants may explain the presence of aspirin in the bloodstream of vegetarians. The omega-3 fatty acids our brain needs for optimal health (both long and short chain) can be obtained from plant sources. Blue-green algae can produce neurotoxins and should be avoided.

T-290	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-health/	brain health	Lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet, physical exercise, and mental exercise could play an important role in the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (see also here). A Mediterranean diet may not only reduce risk of Alzheimer’s, but may also reduce mortality from the disease. Different fruits and vegetables appear to support different cognitive domains of the brain, so both variety and quantity in the diet are important. Greater fruit and vegetable consumption has been linked with lower rates of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The consumption of blueberries and strawberries is associated with delayed cognitive aging by as much as 2.5 years. Ellagic acid may play a role in the ability of berries to prevent age related cognitive decline, but its absorption is blocked by dairy.The relationship between tofu and dementia may be related to formaldehyde contamination. Apple juice did not appear to increase cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s patients, even though in a petri dish, apple juice and ginger appeared to improve nerve cell survival. However, it has been found that those who drink fruit and vegetable juices had a 76% lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s, possibly due to phytonutrient content. Saffron, when compared to Aricept, a leading drug in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, was found to work just as well without the side effects (see also here). While populations eating more turmeric have a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s, this may be due to their lower consumption of meat, which is also beneficial for Parkinson’s disease. However, turmeric, but not curcumin supplements, was found to alleviate Alzheimer patients’ symptoms. Coffee may also reduce the risk of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Conversely, there is little evidence that coconut oil helps with Alzheimer’s disease. Aluminum is added to processed cheese and may be related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Similarly, iron accumulation in the brain is being increasingly linked to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s, glycotoxins (found mostly in chicken) may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and BMAA, a neurotoxin found in seafood may also be linked with higher rates of neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, there’s been a recommendation that people with a family history of neurodegenerative diseases should avoid milk. Toxic waste in the food supply may help explain the link between dairy consumption and Parkinson’s disease (see also here). Skim milk has been found to have especially high levels of hormones. There may be a simple, cheap, non-invasive test for detection of Alzheimer’s disease.Consumption of methyl mercury can result in microcephaly, impaired cognition, and delayed brain-nerve communication in fetuses, infants, and children. Mercury contamination has also been linked to lower IQs and brain damage in the children of mothers who ingest mercury while pregnant. Women may want to avoid polluted fish consumption for a year before they get pregnant in addition to just during pregnancy. Methyl mercury is found in tuna and fish (see here, here and here). Ayurvedic medications have also been found to be contaminated with mercury and lead. Arsenic is fed to chickens and may be related to neuropathy as well as neurocognitive deficits in children. Getting bitewing or panoramic X-rays at the dentist may be associated with an increased risk of meningioma, the most common type of brain tumor. Dehydration may impair cognitive functions.Pork tapeworms larvae invading the brain is one of the most common causes of epilepsy (see also here), and may present as migraines or chronic tension headaches. The brain parasite toxoplasma is found in lambs; 10% of Americans are currently infected with this parasite. There are also migratory skin worms from sushi consumption that may get into the brain. Neurotoxic chemicals in chicken, including beta-carboline alkaloids, may also explain the link between meat consumption and the common neurological disorder essential tremor. There are neurotoxins in fish that cannot be neutralized with cooking and can cause strange reactions (like hot feels like cold, cold feels hot). Similarly, domoic acid, found in seafood, has been found to cause an unusual form of amnesia.Aspirin naturally found in plants may explain the presence of aspirin in the bloodstream of vegetarians. The omega-3 fatty acids our brain needs for optimal health (both long and short chain) can be obtained from plant sources. Blue-green algae can produce neurotoxins and should be avoided. Cognitive deficits may be an early sign of B12 deficiency, which is more frequent in vegans and vegetarians than omnivores (see also here).	-	brain disease,Alzheimer’s disease,heart health,blood

T-291	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-parasites/	brain parasites	Pork tapeworms can infest the human brain. They are the most common cause of adult onset epilepsy in the world. Another type of brain worm can be contracted from eating fish. Approximately 1 in 6 US lambs is infected with toxoplasma brain parasites, with which about 10% of Americans are infected. There also is a rare condition called delusional parasitosis, where the patient believes they are infected with parasites even though they are not (though it can be caused by pork tapeworms in the brain). A higher rate of cancer deaths among those that handle and process meat has been potentially attributed to infection with animal viruses and chronic exposure to animal proteins. Bacteria-eating viruses (bacteriophages) have been approved as meat additives to reduce the risk of Listeria and Campylobacter found in processed meat and poultry products, but there is a concern they could spread toxin genes between bacteria.	-	parasites,brain health,brain disease,food poisoning,tapeworms,foodborne illness,pork,zoonotic disease,neurocysticercosis,epilepsy,seizures,headaches,seafood,meat,fish	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/26/chronic-headaches-and-pork-parasites/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/02/adding-fda-approved-viruses-to-meat/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/not-so-delusional-parasitosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-epilepsy-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chronic-headaches-and-pork-tapeworms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sexually-transmitted-fish-toxin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/not-so-delusional-parasitosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pork,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sexually-transmitted-fish-toxin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/camplyobacter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-epilepsy-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/listeria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-health	
T-293	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-tumors/	brain tumors	The brain is packed with an enormous number of different types of connected and adjacent cells. ‘Brain tumors’ is a broad term referring to ‘tumors’ (cluster of abnormally multiplying cells) of any of the brain’s many cells. The abnormal multiplication is believed to arise from changes to the genetic material of the cells in the tumor.The brain has a safety cover called the “blood-brain barrier,” but some toxins (including those that may be potentially carcinogenic). In one study, children of farm workers, who may be exposed to large amounts of pesticides, fertilizers, and many other substances, had about twice the rate of leukemia and brain tumors.Pesticides can get into our blood from foods we eat. In separate studies, subjects alternately ate non-organic and organic foods. In going from non-organic to organic, within days to a week, there were significant reductions in pesticide levels in blood; and vice-versa for the reverse switch.Ionizing radiation such as dental X-rays can easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. For non-dental X-rays, very high X-ray exposure comes from CAT scans, which has been estimated to cause 29,000 new cancers each year. Yet dental X-rays greatly outnumber CAT scans, coming in at a hundred million every year. One study also found that patients who got a bitewing X-ray had about twice the odds of developing a brain tumor, and those who got a full-mouth X-ray before age 10 were five times as likely to develop a brain tumor. The American Dental Association cautions that dentists only obtain X-rays for diagnosis or treatment decisions rather than routine screening.	-	cancer,brain health,meat,brain disease,leukemia,chicken,breast cancer,heart health,inflammation,heart disease,children,animal products,breast disease,Alzheimer’s disease,zoonotic disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/26/chronic-headaches-and-pork-parasites/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/13/how-risky-are-ct-scans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/10/food-dyes-and-adhd/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chronic-headaches-and-pork-tapeworms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-cell-phones-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-aspartame-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-poultry-viruses-in-human-cancers/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/american-dental-association/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cat-scan/	
T-298	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bread/	bread	Milling whole wheat into white flour may cause as much as a 300-fold decrease in phytonutrient content and white bread may be associated with increased cancer risk, especially prostate cancer. There are few antioxidants in white bread.  Eating white bread also seems to have a negative effect on cognitive function and it appears to increase our insulin level.On the other hand, unrefined, whole grains have been associated with lower risk of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Rye intake may be associated with lower breast and prostate cancer risk. What about gluten? While there are few studies on gluten, it appears that non-celiac gluten sensitivity may indeed be linked with irritable bowel syndrome, although it does not seem to be common. After ruling out celiac disease, those who feel they are gluten sensitive should first try improving other aspects of their diet since as many as one in three people who avoid gluten due to symptoms actually have a different disease altogether.	-	vegetables,fruit,plant-based diets,meat,high blood pressure,blood pressure,cardiovascular health,animal products,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,hypertension,heart health,vegetarians,eggs,vegans	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/09/what-about-all-the-sugar-in-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/23/how-a-gluten-free-diet-can-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/18/gluten-sensitivity-put-to-the-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/09/benefits-of-oatmeal-for-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/07/treating-breast-pain-with-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-diet-may-affect-stress-responses-in-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-hibiscus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/predimed-does-eating-nuts-prevent-strokes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-help-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mediterranean-diet-or-a-whole-food-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-consumption-and-the-development-of-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-the-fiber-theory-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/music-for-anxiety-mozart-vs-metal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/great-grain-robbery/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-sensitivity-real/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whole-beets-vs-juice-for-improving-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-white-bread-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-vinegar-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-five-to-one-fiber-rule/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gluten-free-diets-separating-the-wheat-from-the-chat/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gluten,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/great-grain-robbery/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-hibiscus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-sensitivity-real/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-white-bread-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rye,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/wheat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gluten-free-diets-separating-the-wheat-from-the-chat/	
T-300	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breakfast-cereal/	breakfast cereal	While breakfast cereals are convenient, it’s important to read their labels. Many of them contain added sugar, even the ones we think are healthier options. This is one reason that oatmeal is a better choice. (Oatmeal also may help with weight loss, cholesterol reduction, and an improvement in liver function.)Many breakfast cereals contain fiber, but most of them violate the “five-to-one fiber rule”: divide the number of carbohydrate grams by the number of dietary fiber grams (a result of 5 or less indicates a healthy balance of ingredients).Breakfast cereals are very low in antioxidants, especially when compared to breakfast alternatives like fruit smoothies. Adding fruit to cereals is a good idea: a half-cup of blueberries eaten with breakfast cereal may help blunt the cereal’s glycemic effects.Fortified breakfast cereal can provide vitamin B12, a nutrient that is not naturally available in plant foods.	-	vegetables,antioxidants,sugar,fruit,bread,weight loss,fiber,cancer,diabetes,oxidative stress,rice,obesity,phytonutrients,eggs,cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/23/can-you-eat-too-much-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/09/benefits-of-oatmeal-for-fatty-liver-disease/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-raisins-cause-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-cholesterol-fighters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-five-to-one-fiber-rule/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-help-fatty-liver-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oatmeal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoothies/	
T-301	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/	breast cancer	In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. A plant-based diet may be beneficial in preventing, slowing, and even treating breast cancer, despite flawed or deceptive studies to the contrary.Diets containing less meat may reduce the risk of breast cancer by lowering one’s exposure to anabolic steroids, heterocyclic amines, cadmium, saturated fat, trans fat, Neu5Gc, methionine, cholesterol, IGF-1, PhlP, and industrial pollutants. Meat may also lead to inflammation and over-activation of the enzyme TOR, which may be linked with increased breast cancer.Dairy, even organic cow’s milk, contains hormones that may increase breast cancer risk directly or indirectly by contributing to premature puberty. This may be due to the endocrine disrupting chemicals linked with dairy proteins. Melatonin suppression by meat and dairy may also play a role. Eating a single egg a day has been associated with nearly three times the risk of breast cancer.Supplements such as iron supplements, folic acid supplements, and multivitamins may also increase one’s risk. Alcohol intake may even double the risk of breast cancer, even just light drinking. Obesity has also been linked with high rates of breast cancer, possibly due to high insulin levels. Statin drugs, CT scans, kimchi, and acrylamide from fried carbs may also be linked to breast cancer risk.Vegetables appear to be protective against breast cancer, possibly due to their high fiber content as women with more freqent bowel movements have a lower risk for breast cancer. The most protective appear to be cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, possibly due to the sulforphane content, kale, collard greens, cabbage, and allium family vegetables (such as garlic, onions and leeks). Also protective are amla (against both cancer cell growth and invasion), mushrooms, turmeric, nuts, coffee, rye bread, Nori seaweed, black beans and other beans, phytates in legumes, whole grains, and seeds, and avocados (though there is natural toxin in avocados that may be a problem).  Flaxseed is another food that may prevent and treat breast cancer.Among fruits, organic strawberries and cranberries appear to block cancer cell growth and, like other berries, may block breast-cell DNA damage. Apples, in particular the peels, also appear to reduce breast cancer risk.Soy foods have the distinction of both helping prevent breast cancer (in part by supporting normal pubertal development) and improving survival, even for women on Tamoxifen. But consuming over 3-5 servings of soy foods per day may lead to high levels of cancer-promoting IGF-1. Also, non-GMO soy may be safer in terms of toxin exposure.	-	cancer,women's health,hormones,heart health,soy,cardiovascular disease,phytoestrogens,cardiovascular health,heart disease,ovarian

T-302	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer-survival/	breast cancer survival	One out of every eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.  And yet, it seems to be largely preventable by way of a healthy diet and lifestyle. Researchers created a “healthy lifestyle index” whereby women who checked off certain boxes: (1) avoiding tobacco, (2) avoiding alcohol, (3) daily exercise and (4) a plant-based diet cut their breast cancer odds by 80%. Similarly, women already diagnosed with breast cancer quadrupled their chances of survival.Yes, other strategies seem to reduce breast cancer risk by up to 60% such as removal of ovaries or using the drug tamoxifen – but not without severe side-effects such as uterine cancer and blood clots.That’s why less toxic, even safe, preventive strategies such as daily consumption of a plant-based diet including fiber, flax, soy and cruciferous vegetables while decreasing cholesterol levels and consumption of methionine-containing animal products and alcohol might be a better way to go.Cancer feeds on cholesterol. Transformed cells take up LDL and are capable of stimulating the growth of human breast cancer cells.  This appears worse in breast tumors with higher levels of LDL receptors. Recently, researchers found reduced breast cancer risk associated with higher consumption of sunflower and pumpkin seeds.  This is likely due to phytosterols in the seeds that have been shown to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. The slightest bit of alcohol may increase cancer risk.  However, the Harvard Women’s Health Study showed almost no increased risk from moderate red wine consumption.  Why? The grape skin in red wine (not white) may suppress the proliferation of aromatase—the enzyme used by breast tumors to produce their own estrogen, and thus grow.To get the good without the bad – just eat the whole red grape (especially seeded grapes) and avoid the alcohol. To fight tumor cells we need to be able to combat something they have that non-cancerous cells do not have.  One thing that may be is a dependence on methionine – the amino acid.It seems that starving the body (and tumor) of methionine by avoiding foods particularly high in methionine such as meat (especially chicken and fish), eggs and dairy may help stifle tumor growth.Multiple studies have shown reduced mortality and reoccurrence by eating soy. Specifically, a 29% lower risk of dying from breast cancer and a 36% lower risk of cancer recurrence.How? Cancer works in part by turning off BRCA genes – genes responsible for DNA repair.  These BRCA genes are called oncosuppressors (tumor suppressors) and cancer turns them off in a process called methylation.  When researchers introduced soy phytonutrients to breast cancer tumors – the equivalent to about a cup of soybeans – the BRCA genes were turned back on, ramping up DNA repair. This suggests soy phytonutrients might reverse DNA hypermethylation and restore the expression of the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.Studies have shown that less than a single serving a day of cruciferous veggies may cut the risk of cancer progression or reoccurrence by more than half.In the largest associative studies to date, women who ate the highest amount of fiber had up to 85% lower odds of breast cancer.  Breast cancer risk was 15% lower per 20/grams of fiber consumed per day.Further, a more reliable meta-analysis of cohort studies showed that every 10 g/day of increased fiber consumption resulted in a 7% reduced risk of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies in the US, Italy and Germany, including the largest study to date, have shown a decreased risk of breast cancer correlated with higher serum lignans levels. Flax seed has by far the highest concentration of lignans – up to 800 times higher than a dozen other plant foods (the only whole-food sources of lignans).A review of those studies comparing 3,000 women with breast cancer to 3,000 women without found that consumption of flax alone correlated with a 20-30% reduction in breast cancer risk.Further, a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of flax seeds in breast cancer patients found that flax appears to have the potential to reduce human breast tumor growth in just a matter of weeks. The flax group saw, on average, their tumor cell proliferation go down; cancer cell death go up; and their c-erbB2 score go down—which is a marker of cancer aggressiveness, and potential for forming metastases and spreading.	-	breast cancer,women's health,cancer,breast health,vegans,vegetarians,plant-based diets,cancer survival,seeds,mortality,flax seeds,lignans,LDL cholesterol,soy,cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/12/gmo-soy-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/08/a-low-methionine-diet-may-help-starve-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/17/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/14/breast-cancer-cells-feed-on-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/18/can-eating-soy-prevent-breast-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-feeds-breast-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brca-breast-cancer-genes-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-clinical-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fiber-vs-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-flax-seeds-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-epidemiological-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/metastases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tumor-suppressor-genes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/methionine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brca-genes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tamoxifen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytosterols/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aromatase/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pumpkin-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lignans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flax-seeds,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/red-wine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ldl-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish/	
T-305	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-health/	breast health	Plant-based diets may help prevent breast cancer and prolong survival, thanks to phytonutrients in flax, broccoli, and soy, and the avoidance of animal products such as meat and dairy. One should eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and get a enough exercise and sleep. Some foods may be especially helpful include: dark-green leafy vegetables, coffee, Indian gooseberries, avocados, spinach, garlic, onions, cinnamon, apples, strawberries, herbal teas, green tea, and white-button mushrooms. Those at high risk should consider reducing their consumption of meat, dairy (see also here), trans fat, saturated fat, Kimchi, folic-acid supplements (but folate from beans and greens is helpful), multivitamins, and deep fried foods. Large stool size has been associated with breast health and may reduce cancer risk. One might also not want to take advice from health food store employees, as their recommendations for breast cancer treatment were found to lack a sound medical or scientific basis.	-	women's

T-306	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-milk/	breast milk	Human breast milk is one of the few animal products that is high in antioxidants, and is a good source of omega 3’s for infants. The best formula for most infants is their mother’s breast milk, and at least babies three months and under should ideally be fed only breast milk.Pollutants such as PCBs and flame retardant chemicals can be passed from mother to baby through breast milk. The xenoestrogens found in human breast milk (due mostly to fish consumption) may possibly explain the rise in allergic diseases. The breast milk of those eating more plant-based appears to be the least polluted. Vegans in general have lower levels of pollutants circulating in their blood stream, but vegans who have been breastfed as infants may have been exposed to organochlorines accumulated vy their mothers.Milk proteins in breast milk break down into peptides that can opiate-like drug effects; this helps bond child to mother, but cay cause problems if people continue to drink milk into adulthood. Sudden infant death syndrome (CID) may be related to a mother’s consumption of cow’s milk. Testing for Vitamin B12 deficiency is appropriate for certain people. Vegans who do not supplement or fortify their diets with Vitamin B12 will have deficient breast milk and may place their child in danger. Vegan mothers must also be careful about getting enough iodine. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding and eating fenugreek, make sure to tell your OB.	-	breastfeeding,milk,infant formula,protein,women's health,dairy,infants,plant-based diets,autoimmune diseases,immune function,prediabetes,type 1 diabetes,Japan,pregnancy,cardiovascular disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-great-protein-fiasco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/american-vegans-placing-babies-at-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-casein-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-protein-combining-myth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-consumption-and-the-development-of-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-infant-colic-by-changing-moms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/did-a-vegan-diet-kill-this-baby/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegan-women-supplement-with-dha-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/side-effect-of-fenugreek-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthy-food-movement-strength-in-unity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-athlete-immunity-with-chlorella-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-induced-infant-apnea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/did-a-vegan-diet-kill-this-baby/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/xenoestrogens,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/side-effect-of-fenugreek-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-induced-infant-apnea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/american-vegans-placing-babies-at-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2/	
T-308	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breastfeeding/	breastfeeding	Breastfeeding bonds child to mother. In the very least, babies three months and under should ideally be fed only breast milk. Advantages of eating plenty of plant-based foods while breastfeeding include passing along plant-based omega-3, which has been shown to improve children’s intelligence. Babies can pick up a taste for vegetables, even strong-tasting foods like broccoli, through breastfeeding and keep that fondness for the vegetable even after breastfeeding ends.Pollutants found in processed foods that a mother consumes while breastfeeding may be directly transferred to her child. Unfortunately, there has been a recent spike of PBDEs (flame retardant chemicals) in breast milk. Toxins such as PCB , more concentrated in foods derived from animals higher on the food chain, tend to accumulate in breast milk. The breast milk of vegetarians appear to have significantly lower levels of PCBs, DDT, and dioxins than that those on a standard American diet.A breastfeeding mother who drinks cow’s milk can pass onto her child the cow’s casomorphin protein, which in rare cases may cause respiratory distress and infant apnea in the infant. Baby formulas based on cow’s milk introduce infants to a drink that is meant to grow a baby calf at 40 times the rate of a human child, which may help explain increased obesity rates among  formula-fed children.Breastfeeding vegans must be sure to get adequate Vitamin B12 (see also here, here) and iodine to ensure the health of their baby.	-	breast milk,women's health,milk,pregnancy,infants,dairy,protein,infant formula,prediabetes,plant-based diets,type 1 diabetes,heart health,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,heart disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/16/how-milk-may-contribute-to-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/09/what-to-eat-to-reduce-our-toxic-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/21/cows-milk-casomorphin-crib-death-and-autism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-great-protein-fiasco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/natural-treatments-morning-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/american-vegans-placing-babies-at-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-casein-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-consumption-and-the-development-of-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-to-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-infant-colic-by-changing-moms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/did-a-vegan-diet-kill-this-baby/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegan-women-supplement-with-dha-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-optimal-dose-of-vitamin-d-based-on-natural-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/side-effect-of-fenugreek-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-acne-barberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthy-food-movement-strength-in-unity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-induced-infant-apnea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/formula-for-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/infants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/did-a-vegan-diet-kill-this-baby/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ddt/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/21/cows-milk-casomorphin-crib-death-and-autism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/infant-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/standard-american-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-induced-infant-apnea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/american-vegans-placing-babies-at-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/formula-for-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2/	
T-314	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli/	broccoli	Broccoli can be considered a dark green leafy vegetable, and may help lower the risk of mouth throat, lung, breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and prostate cancers. Raw broccoli specifically may also help bladder cancer survival. Broccoli may even protect against DNA damage, affect gene expression, and boost liver function. Broccoli is most nutritious when steamed, raw, or microwaved and less nutritious when baked, boiled, pressure-cooked, or fried. Microwaving broccoli for more than two minutes, however, will significantly decrease its nutritional quality. The nutritional content of broccoli, along with that of many other crops, has on average decreased 15% in the past 50 years. Researchers can now measure broccoli consumption through a urine test, something which will help improve the accuracy of broccoli studies. Broccoli is also a good source of antioxidants, although adding some additional herbs and spices, such as mustard seed, to it can dramatically increase the antioxidant level. Broccoli and broccoli sprouts are probably the best food to eat to “detox.” Broccoli may also promote iron absorption due to its high vitamin C content. Eating more than 100 cups of broccoli a day is probably not a good idea. Eating broccoli without chewing after gastric bypass surgery is also not recommended. Broccoli sprouts, when grown at home, are probably the most affordable health food there is in terms of bang for one’s nutritional buck. They are considered safer to consume than alfalfa sprouts. New research shows that broccoli may also help block absorption of toxins in the gut, boost detoxifying enzymes in the liver, and play a role in gut immunity. So with all the upsides of eating broccoli, all the parents are asking: how do I get my kids to eat it? Simple, just call it power punch broccoli or put an Elmo sticker on it.	-	fruit,vegetables,cancer,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,diabetes,cardiovascular health,meat,vitamin

Broccoli sprouts have a higher nutrient level than broccoli supplements, and raw broccoli has more sulfuraphane than cooked. Raw broccoli sprouts are not associated with food poisoning like alfalfa sprouts. In one study, seemed to protect skin cells from sun damage. The good news is you can grow your own broccoli sprouts at home at a lower cost than buying them in the store.

T-322	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brussels-sprouts/	Brussels sprouts	As a member of the cruciferous family of vegetables including broccoli, kale, cauliflower, and cabbage, research indicates that Brussels sprouts—a top ten antioxidant-rich food—may play a role in fighting cancer and suppressing upper respiratory infections like the common cold.Scientists have found that cruciferous vegetables like Brussels sprouts contain a phytonutrient that is converted by our stomach acid into a form that activates our Ah receptors, which help protect against intestinal pathogens and sustain intestinal immune function. In fact, vegetable intake is associated with lower risk of inflammatory bowel diseases than a conventional meat-based diet. Researchers found that adding broccoli and Brussels sprouts to a meal of cooked meat greatly reduced the volume of meat mutagens circulating in the bloodstream and sustained improved liver function two weeks later.When scientists got prostate cancer patients to change their ratio of animal to vegetable proteins from about 2 to 1 to roughly 1 to 1, the average PSA doubling time (how fast the tumor doubled in size) slowed from 21 months to 58 months.  An earlier study has already shown that 12 months on a strictly plant-based diet may have actually reversed progression of prostate cancer.Brussels sprouts are among the vegetable that bind bile acids best, thus potentially reducing cancer risk.	-	vegetables,broccoli,cruciferous vegetables,cabbage,cauliflower,kale,fruit,phytonutrients,greens,cancer,oxidative stress,antioxidants,women's health,breast cancer,cooking methods	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/07/our-immune-system-uses-plants-to-activate-gut-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/18/broccoli-boosts-liver-detox-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/24/cancer-and-the-animal-to-plant-protein-ratio/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/repairing-dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-chocolate-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aluminum-in-vaccines-vs-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/using-the-produce-aisle-to-boost-immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bile-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cabbage/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-health,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli	
T-327	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/burgers/	burgers	More than half of the content of fast-food burgers from eight businesses was found to not be musclemeat. Raw or cooked, hamburger and other meat may have endotoxins that can contribute to inflammation.  Undercooking poses food poisoning and even risk or death. The frying of burgers and other meats may produce carcinogens. Fast food burgers have a high glycotoxin content which may contribute to premature aging. They also have significant amounts of cholesterol, saturated fat,and trans fat.  A bunless (and therefore carbless) burger may lead to a higher insulin spike than a cup and a half of white flour pasta. In terms of uric acid production, though, fish may be worse than burgers.To deal with health concerns, proposed ideas have included putting fruit extracts and flaxseeds in burgers and distributing statins with fast food meals. The food industry uses a number of tactics very similar to the tobacco industry to downplay the health risks associated with ultra processed foods such as hamburgers.	-	hamburgers,meat,plant-based diets,chicken,animal products,vegans,heart health,vegetables,fat,vegetarians,fruit,cardiovascular health,animal protein,sugar,mortality	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/21/the-real-paleo-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/01/flax-seeds-can-have-profound-effect-on-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/27/trans-fat-in-animal-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/18/paula-deen-diabetes-drug-spokesperson/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/31/does-animal-protein-cause-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/28/white-meat-may-be-as-cholesterol-raising-as-red/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/28/how-fatty-foods-may-affect-our-love-life/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-fatty-foods-addictive/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industry-response-to-plants-not-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-a-sugary-grave/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-do-you-want-fries-with-that-lipitor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-cholesterol-in-the-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funded-research-bias/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-a-sugary-grave/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-do-you-want-fries-with-that-lipitor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-cholesterol-in-the-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funded-research-bias/

T-339	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cabbage/	cabbage	Cabbage, along with other vegetables from the cruciferous family, may be among the best foods for cancer prevention and survival, particularly prostate and breast cancer. It is uniquely rich in glucosinolates and high in antioxidants. Cruciferous vegetables also contain a phytonutrient that boosts immune function by stimulating the Ah receptor in our intestines. The bile-binding properties of cabbage are enhanced by steaming. On the other hand, the cabbage enzymes that produce sulforaphane – which may protect our brain, eyesight, and help us defend ourselves against free radicals and cancer – are deactivated by cooking. Adding the enzymes back in the form of mustard powder to cooked cruciferous vegetables can compensate for the deactivation. While cabbage naturally contains several sulfur containing compounds, studies did not show an increased risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (unlike sulfur-rich animal proteins).Purple cabbage contains anthocyanins, a phytonutrient found in blue/black/purple-pigmented produce that appear to protect against macular degeneration. Furthermore, it is the cheapest source of antioxidants in terms of nutrient content per dollar. You can even test the acidity of your urine using purple cabbage!	-	vegetables,cancer,fruit,beans,women's health,standard American diet,antioxidants,fiber,vegans,grains,colon cancer,plant-based diets,vegetarians,breast cancer,gut flora	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/07/our-immune-system-uses-plants-to-activate-gut-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/29/quadrupling-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/08/currant-treatment-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/24/cancer-and-the-animal-to-plant-protein-ratio/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biggest-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-cinnamon-for-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/anthocyanins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biggest-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mustard-powder/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eye-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-health	
T-343	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cadmium/	cadmium	Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in our bodies over time and may contribute to heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and infertility in men. It is found in cigarette smoke, seafood (particularly tuna), meat and organ meats, some protein powders, as well as in vegetables and whole grains. The bioavailability of cadmium in plant foods, however, is poor compared to animal foods. In fact, it appears that plant foods may inhibit cadmium absorption from animal foods; cadmium levels have been shown to drop significantly by switching to a vegetarian diet. Organic produce may contain half the amount of cadmium found in conventional produce (likely due to commercial fertilizers), suggesting that switching to an organic, plant-based diet may provide the least exposure to this metal.	-	heavy metals,mercury,lead,fish,EPA,supplements,industrial pollutants,junk food,fruit,meat,infants,arsenic,vegetarians,vegans,plant-based diets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/21/the-real-paleo-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/15/how-to-reduce-your-dietary-cadmium-absorption/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/seafood,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organ-meats/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heavy-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tuna,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods	
T-345	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/caffeine/	caffeine	Caffeine exists naturally in tea, coffee, and cocoa. Like many plant compounds, caffeine has a long list of potential health benefits including increased energy, better endurance, improved physical performance, enhanced short-term memory, superior focus, and faster mental cognition. Pregnant women should consume no more than 200-300 mg a day, however. Though trace amounts of caffeine may be present in the water supply and in chicken feed, the levels are low enough to not pose a risk to pregnant women.One may experience caffeine withdrawal symptoms within a few days of reduced intake, but its addictiveness may be beneficial for those with health conditions amenable to the intake of coffee. Tea may also be addicting even though it is less caffeinated than coffee. Tea also contains theanine, a substance that stimulates alpha brainwave activity and promotes a feeling of calmness. It may actually be harder for those eating cruciferous vegetables th to get a caffeine buzz since they better enable the liver to clear caffeine from the body. Theoretically grapefruit might have the opposite effect.No difference in urine output was found between drinking caffeinated tea and plain water, suggesting tea is as hydrating as water. Caffeine appears to help protect against the development of Parkinson’s disease in both Asian and Western populations. As little as two cups of coffee a day contains enough caffeine to improve symptoms for those who have already been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada disputes the misconception that caffeine increases breast pain. Despite the fact that caffeine is a stimulant, it appears to have no effect on atrial fibrillation, although it may impair artery function. Caffeinated coffee may lead to heartburn in some, increase risk of glaucoma, and increase risk of dry eye disease. For those under 55, it is not recommended to drink more than four cups a day.	-	women's health,coffee,tea,heart disease,heart health,water,beverages,medications,cancer,weight loss,phytonutrients,cardiovascular disease,green tea,safety limits,mortality	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/10/coffee-for-hepatitis-c/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/29/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/12/how-grapefruit-affects-prescription-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/18/broccoli-boosts-liver-detox-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/26/why-are-chickens-fed-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/12/treating-breast-pain-with-flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/10/coffee-caveats/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/23/role-caffeine-artery-function/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tea-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-fine-kettle-of-fluoxetine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caffeine-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-fish-white-fish-dark-fish-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-liver-cancer-with-coffee/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/memory,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/coffee,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cognition,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/water,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caffeine-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-fish-white-fish-dark-fish-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/energy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-fine-kettle-of-fluoxetine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/glaucoma,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cocoa,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/caffeine/The%20new%20dietary%20guidelines%20for%20beverages%20recommend%20tea%20and%20coffee%20second%20only%20to%20water%20in%20healthfulness,%20but%20what%20about%20concerns%20they%20might%20impair%20the%20function%20of%20our%20endothelium?	
T-346	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cake/	cake	Cake and other desserts are among the leading sources of cholesterol, saturated fat and trans fat in the American diet. Grain-based desserts take the bronze medal for saturated fat according to a 2010 report from the National Cancer Institute, only to be outdone by pizza and cheese. Saturated fat has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, bacterial vaginosis, and a myriad of other health problems, although the beef and dairy industries have designed studies to try to downplay the harmful effects of saturated fat intake. Trans fat is even worse: cake and other baked goods were found to constitute 40% of total trans fats consumed.Eggs are one of the major contributors of cholesterol in cake, but other ingredients such as dairy and certain oils can drive the total cholesterol count even higher. Cakes made out of coconut or flax-seed oil will not raise cholesterol levels as much as butter or cod-liver oil, but should still be used sparingly as both oils may raise LDL cholesterol levels. A study found that kindergarteners and pre-schoolers took on average one full serving of fruit when served next to cake and other junk foods.	-	cardiovascular health,fat,heart health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,animal products,meat,animal fat,saturated fat,vegetables,fruit,industry influence,stroke,chicken,cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/22/foods-for-a-long-life-and-love-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/29/butter-is-back/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/12/how-to-get-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/06/egg-industry-caught-making-false-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/14/how-the-meat-industry-designed-a-highly-misleading-study/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-diet-soda-increase-stroke-risk-as-much-as-regular-soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fill-in-the-blank/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-trans-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediterranean-diet-and-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tightening-the-bible-belt/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/butter,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/junk-food,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-trans-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beef,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish-oil,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/trans-fats,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oils	
T-347	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/calcium/	calcium	Calcium is more readily absorbable from greens such as kale and broccoli than milk. Getting your calcium from plants also means that getting fiber, antioxidants, and folate as well, whereas dairy calcium comes with saturated fat, hormones, and cholesterol. Calcium supplements are not recommended as they might increase your risk of other conditions like glaucoma. Soluble oxalates can bind to calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate, which can lead to kidney stones in susceptible individuals, which is why some people may want to limit their intake of turmeric. Despite prior beliefs that high protein intake is associated with increased calcium excretion through urine, this calcium loss predominantly does not appear to come from the skeleton.Omnivores, raw food enthusiasts, and vegans alike were all found to be eating calcium deficient diets. Long-time vegans appear to have the same bone mineral density as omnivores of a similar height, weight, and activity level, despite the fact that they may only consume about half the amount of calcium as their dairy-eating counterparts.  High consumption of phytates and fiber appears to enhance bone-mineral density.  Moreover, fortified soymilk is absorbed just as well as cow’s milk by osteopenic post-menopausal women (although you must shake the soy milk carton to distribute the calcium).	-	heart disease,cardiovascular disease,milk,cardiovascular health,heart health,vitamin D supplements,dairy,bone health,osteoporosis,plant-based diets,saturated fat,animal products,cancer,protein,supplements	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/10/how-plants-can-be-both-safer-and-more-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/21/the-real-paleo-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/05/latest-science-on-rooibos-nettle-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/09/the-healthiest-diet-for-weight-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/12/who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/31/does-animal-protein-cause-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/20/how-beans-help-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/28/phytates-in-beans-anti-nutrient-or-anti-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-vs-cow-calcium-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-great-protein-fiasco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vit-d-supplements-help-diabetes-weight-loss-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-treatment-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-healthiest-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-protein-bad-to-the-bone/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-protein-combining-myth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrient-dense-approach-to-weight-management/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-vs-cow-calcium-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soymilk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-protein-bad-to-the-bone/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oxalates,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/folate,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/glaucoma,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	
T-349	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/california/	California	A lot of American produce comes from California, including avocados, which the California Avocado Commission concludes may be protective against breast cancer. The California Prune Board convinced the FDA to rename prunes “dried plums.”The California legislature has attempted to increase public awareness regarding the amount of pesticides and heavy metal toxin contaminants in food with its “Proposition 65” initiative, which requires warning labels on potentially harmful products, including things like fish oil and nutritional yeast. Despite the warnings, California children’s exposure to chemicals such as flame retardant pollutants, arsenic, banned pesticides, and dioxins is among the highest in the world. Not only are California children contaminated, but women’s breast tissue samples were found to contain ten times more industrial toxins than women tested in any other part of the world (although California seaweed and soy eaters may be at a decreased risk for breast cancer). The state has also sought to decrease the use of caramel coloring, which may be carcinogenic.California lawmakers also broached the idea of requiring doctors, as part of their continuing education, to receive nutritional training to better serve their patients. Unfortunately the California Medical Association opposed the bill, along with other mainstream medical groups; eventually the bill passed, but only after it took out any nutritional education requirements.California is home to a population that has the distinction of having remarkable longevity—comparable to those in Japan who, for the most part, abide by a plant-based diet. The vegetarian Adventists of Loma Linda, California have perhaps the longest life expectancy of any population formerly studied.	-	women's health,seafood,cancer,meat,fish,industrial pollutants,heart disease,animal products,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,vegetarians,heart health,plant-based diets,vegans,safety limits	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/13/does-caramel-color-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slimming-the-gecko-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-intestines-for-food-and-cosmetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-californian-breast-tissue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-did-doctors-not-know-about-the-risks-of-hormone-therapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heavy-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/longevity,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/avocados,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-californian-breast-tissue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/FDA,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/california/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/women's-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/	
T-353	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/caloric-restriction/	caloric restriction	Caloric restriction may improve memory in seniors. It also may increases lifespan by different mechanisms such as increasing the levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), through xenohormesis, a process where plants pass on their stress-resilient phytonutrients, and/or through the inhibition of the enzyme TOR, which also protect from some invasive cancers and have positive effects on the reduction of metabolic syndrome and blood sugar levels. Since the effects of caloric restriction seem to correlate more with protein intake than calorie restriction itself, the adoption of a low protein diet can potentially include all the benefits of caloric restriction without the side effects of starvation. A severely calorie restricted diet is difficult to sustain and might carry unwanted side-effects, but a plant-based diet was shown to have similar effects on DHEA levels as caloric restriction. Plant-based diets have also been linked to increased longevity due to their naturally low amounts of methionine and leucine, two amino acids associated with aging and tumor development that tend to be more concentrated in animal protein. Plant-based diets may also be as effective as calorie restriction for weight loss.	-	vegetables,weight loss,fruit,mortality,prediabetes,blood sugar,plant-based diets,cancer,diabetes,calories,kidney health,reversing chronic disease,obesity,cholesterol,heart health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/05/how-to-suppress-the-aging-enzyme-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/24/which-works-better-adding-beans-or-portion-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/03/why-certain-plant-compounds-may-mimic-dietary-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/10/how-plant-based-diets-may-extend-our-lives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/09/using-diet-to-treat-asthma-and-eczema/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/14/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/28/how-fatty-foods-may-affect-our-love-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/11/exploiting-autophagy-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/10/25/what-should-women-eat-to-live-longest/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-benefits-of-caloric-restriction-without-the-actual-restricting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caloric-restriction-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-diabetes-with-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slowing-metabolism-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension-strategy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsweetening-the-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-diabetes-surgery/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-fatty-foods-addictive/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenohormesis-what-doesnt-kill-plants-may-make-us-stronger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-reversal-is-it-the-calories-or-the-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-drugs-diets-dont-lower-diabetes-deaths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-we-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/neurobiology-of-artificial-sweeteners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flesh-and-fructose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-benefits-of-caloric-restriction-without-the-actual-restricting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caloric-restriction-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/methionine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dhea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leucine,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension-strategy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifespan,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenohormesis-what-doesnt-kill-plants-may-make-us-stronger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-we-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/	
T-354	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/calories/	calories	Debate has raged over whether excess calories or inadequate exercise is the main cause of the growing obesity epidemic. While we should all aim to meet the recommended minimum of burning 1,000 kcal per week in exercise, access to excess calories seems to be the predominent force behind the obesity epidemic, with 95% of Americans exceeding their maximum caloric allowance. We may be particularly prone to obesity due to our inability to break down uric acid, a compound formed from our metabolism of sugar and meat products that causes fat and salt retention.In contrast to the many diet pills, which may not work, and caloric restriction, replacing animal products with plant foods may be an effective way to decrease calorie consumption. Not only do vegetarians naturally eat fewer calories, they also have higher resting metabolic rates, higher postprandial calorie burn and appear to lose weight more easily. Meat burgers may have 25% more calories than meat-free burgers and hot dogs may have five times more calories than veggie dogs. It appears that calories from plant sources are not processed in our bodies the same way as animal foods – the consumption of meat (poultry in particular) and milk was associated with additional weight gain. The opposite effect has been shown for plant products; participants in one study saw twice as much weight loss consuming the same number of calories when soy was consumed, and consuming nuts and dried fruit to does not appear to lead to the expected weight gain. This might be due to changes in our intestinal flora when we consume meat products, which may allow us to extract more calories from our food.Industrial sugars are another source of empty calories and have also been linked to secondary health problems. Added sugars account for the majority of calories consumed each day by Americans, though consuming low calorie sweeteners may actually lead to greater weight gain by altering brain signals regulating satiation.A better strategy for decreasing calories from sugar would be to decrease our consumption of sweet foods. Over time, our taste buds adjust to become more sensitive, making naturally sweet foods taste sweeter.Excess calories, particularly from protein, may activate the TOR pathway in our cells, accelerating aging. The amino acid methionine may also play a role in this process. For children, increasing calories from plant food appears protective against the development of asthma. The fiber found in plant foods may be strongly protective against stroke. Ingesting more calories from plants also appears to lower IGF-1 levels, a strong promoter of cancer growth, more than simple calorie restriction. Cocoa has many antioxidants and is low calorie, but chocolate is one of the most calorie dense foods we can eat. Some plant foods even provide nutrition without containing hardly calories at all, such as vinegar or tea.Blending vegetables into sauces or dips is a good way to increase vegetable intake in your diet and might lead to lower caloric intake overall.	-	vegetables,cardiovascular disease,weight loss,plant-based diets,heart disease,sugar,cholesterol,cardiovascular health,heart health,processed

T-356	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/campylobacter/	Campylobacter	Campylobacter is a bacteria that may be found in nearly 70% of poultry sold in the US. In most cases, people infected with Campylobacter may experience food poisoning and recover within several days. Some however, may develop irritable bowel syndrome, and others may develop Gullain-Barré Syndrome, a life-threatening auto-immune attack on the nervous system. Exposure to this pathogen occurs primarily via cross-contamination of other foods with raw poultry, rather than from cooked poultry.  Disinfection of kitchen surfaces and utensils has been shown to be ineffective at eliminating Campylobacter, even using “extreme” cleaning methods (a five-minute soak in a bleach solution). Women handling poultry products have an increased risk of urinary tract infections and children who come into contact with raw poultry products while riding in a grocery cart have an 18 fold higher risk of bacterial infection.What is the poultry industry doing to minimize customer exposure to Campylobacter? Meat products may be treated with bacteriophages (species specific viruses that attack bacteria), which may decrease bacterial contamination, but raises the possibility of exchange of genetic material between bacterial strains. The poultry industry also treats their meat with phosphates in order to enhance the color and minimize shrinkage of the product, which may have a one million fold increase in the amount of Campylobacter compared to phosphate free poultry.What about the government? The meat industry won the right to sell contaminated meat, without the fear of governmental interference.	-	foodborne illness,food poisoning,Salmonella,chicken,meat,fecal bacteria,cancer,poultry,E. coli,turkey,fruit,antibiotics,cooking methods,CDC,industry influence	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/u-s-meat-supply-flying-at-half-staph/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-borne-infection-risk-from-shopping-carts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cayenne-pepper-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome-and-chronic-indigestion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-a-neutropenic-diet-necessary-for-cancer-patients/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/foodborne-illness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-borne-infection-risk-from-shopping-carts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cayenne-pepper-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome-and-chronic-indigestion/	
T-357	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/canada/	Canada	Various health organizations in Canada, including governmental agencies are responsible for shaping public policy and providing guidelines to inform and protect Canadians. In 2008, Canada was one of the first countries to ban the use of bisphenol-A (BPA) in baby bottles. Health Canada recommended against eating Hiziki, a type of sea vegetable, due to high levels of arsenic that could be harmful to those who consume it.Canada was the first to approve the use of sucralose, an artificial sweetener, and following the approval, rates of inflammatory bowel disease seemed to double. Cyclamate, another artificial sweetener ingredient, is still available in Canada under various brand names such as Sugar Twin, despite some studies suggesting negative health effects.In 2010, an editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal called upon doctors to recommend a plant-based diet to their patients in order to improve bowel function. The Canadian Diabetes Association recommends consuming pulses, which include beans and lentils, for optimizing diabetes control.There have been many studies in Canada examining the links between diet, health, and disease. Research in Canada has covered various topics such as seeing if antioxidant-rich chlorella could be used to improve flu shot efficacy, examining the accuracy of advice given by health food store employees and pharmacists, and helping to uncover the role of neurotoxin BMAA in Alzheimer’s disease.One Canadian study looked at the diets of over 300,000 people, and found that greater fruit and vegetable consumption was linked to lower odds of psychological distress, mental health issues, and anxiety and mood disorders.A clinical trial of dietary fat reduction for patients with precancerous breast changes conducted in Canada found that those who reduced their fat intake experienced significant reductions in symptoms.	-	alternative medicine,women's health,diabetes,complementary medicine,side effects,liver disease,sugar,cancer,medications,Europe,supplements,breast cancer,breast health,fish,fatigue	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/health-food-store-supplement-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-and-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-plastics-are-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-on-receipts-getting-under-our-skin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-lie-that-heals-should-doctors-give-placebos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pharmacists-versus-health-food-store-employees-who-gives-better-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-athlete-immunity-with-chlorella-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chickens-fate-is-sealed/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lentils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bpa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mood,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sea-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sucralose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cyclamate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arsenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar-twin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/artificial-sweeteners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/low-fat-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mental-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flu-shots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/anxiety	
T-358	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/	cancer	Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death in the United States, and diet may be the leading cause of cancer. The balance of evidence suggests that a whole food, plant-based diet may help prevent, treat, slow, and even reverse cancer progression. It’s never too late to start eating healthier, as cancer risk may drop after starting a plant-based diet at any age.Plant-based diets may be effective because they lower methionine intake, inhibit angiogenesis, intercept carcinogens and increase fiber and antioxidants. Populations eating diets centered on whole plant foods have lower rates of cancer. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables—at least nine daily servings—may boost detoxifying enzymes, lower inflammation, lower cholesterol and make for healthier bowel movements, ridding the body of excess estrogen and cholesterol.Research studies have focused on many specific foods associated with anti-cancer properties. These include many kinds of fruits, legumes, spices, teas and coffees, vegetables and nuts.Other lifestyle habits that appear to help prevent cancer include an hour of exercise every day, seven hours of sleep every night, and reduced exposure to tanning beds, cell-phone radiation, CT scans and dental x-rays. Meditation may also improve DNA health, preventing premature shortening of our telomeres.Consumption of animal products, on the other hand, appears to increase the risk of cancer. Research has shown an association between increased risk of cancer and the consumption of certain foods like cooked meats, dairy, eggs, smoked fish and poultry.What’s behind this increased cancer risk? It may be the inflammatory Neu5Gc molecule found in meat. Certain tumors thrive in an inflammatory setting. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) may also been linked to cancer. Heme iron found in the blood and muscle tissue of animal foods may also increase risk of cancer, as may the chemical pollutants in meat, which can lead to premature puberty, putting children at higher risk for cancer later in life.Other exposures that appear to increase cancer risk include: acrylamide in foods such as French fries, alcohol, caramel coloring, kimchi, Red dye No. 3 and yerba mate.After a cancer diagnosis, cutting down on saturated animal fat appears to improve cancer survival and oatmeal lotion may help with chemotherapy-induced rashes.Please search for specific types of

T-362	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/candy/	candy	Candy consumption contributes to a low healthy eating score. In spite of its mission to promote agribusiness, the USDA recommends less frequent consumption of sugar-containing foods. Greece, where a health agency formulates the guidelines, goes one step further and recommends nuts and fruits over candy bars and sweets. Interestingly enough, though, a candy bar still contains more antioxidants than many foods people eat. Chocolate (containing cocoa phytonutrients) was recently associated with a relief of chronic fatigue syndrome although it is one of the most calorically dense foods we can eat, so best to stick to cocoa itself. Dates, cocoa, raisins, and date-sweetened pumpkin pie are healthy alternatives to junk food. These healthy sweets are not only tasty, but also contain high levels of antioxidants. Licorice consumption should be limited, especially during pregnancy.	-	junk food,processed foods,fruit,cardiovascular disease,calories,vegetables,weight loss,heart disease,sugar,exercise,heart health,cancer,soda,cardiovascular health,beans	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/10/coca-cola-stopped-sponsoring-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/17/aluminum-levels-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/21/making-your-own-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/21/time-hospitals-stop-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/06/how-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/13/are-raisins-a-good-snack-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-cancer-does-lunch-meat-cause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hospitals-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chocolate-and-stroke-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-healthiest-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-just-say-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-raisins-good-snacks-for-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liquid-calories-do-smoothies-lead-to-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-fruit-nut-bars-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-chocolate-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raisins-vs-jelly-beans-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-treatment-for-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foods-increase-happiness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-its-all-greek-to-the-usda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-healthy-on-a-budget/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funded-research-bias/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-raisins-good-snacks-for-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cocoa-good-chocolate-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-dates-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-chocolate-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-treatment-for-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-just-say-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/USDA,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/licorice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-its-all-greek-to-the-usda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Chocolate,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Greece,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-licorice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cocoa	
T-374	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens/	carcinogens	Cancer is the #2 killer in the United States, and diet may be the #1 cause of cancer. The balance of evidence suggests that a whole food, plant-based diet may help prevent, treat, slow, and even reverse cancer progression. It’s never too late to start eating healthier, as cancer risk may drop after starting a plant-based diet at any age.Some reasons why plant-based diets may be effective include lowering methionine intake, inhibiting angiogenesis, intercepting carcinogens, and increasing fiber and antioxidants. Populations eating diets centered on whole plant foods have lower rates of cancer. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables—at least 9 daily servings may boost detoxifying enzymes, lower inflammation, lower cholesterol, and make for healthier bowel movements, ridding the body of excess estrogen and cholesterol.Specific foods that research studies have associated with anti-cancer properties include:Other lifestyle habits that appear to help prevent cancer include an hour of exercise every day, 7-hours sleep every night, and reduced exposure to tanning beds, cell-phone radiation, CT scans, and dental x-rays. Meditation may also improve DNA health, preventing premature shortening of our telomeres.Consumption of animal products appears to increase the risk of cancer.  Research has shown an association between increased risk of cancer and the consumption of the following foods:It may be the inflammatory Neu5Gc molecule found in meat that accounts for some of the increased cancer risk. Certain tumors thrive in an inflammatory setting. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) may also been linked to cancer. Heme iron found in the blood and muscle tissue of animal foods may also increase risk of cancer, as may the chemical pollutants in meat, which can lead to premature puberty, putting children at higher risk for cancer later in life.After a cancer diagnosis, cutting down on saturated animal fat appears to improve cancer survival. A neutropenic diet (one devoid of fresh fruit and vegetables) may not help those undergoing chemotherapy, but oatmeal lotion may help with chemotherapy induced rashes.Other exposures that appear to increase cancer risk include:See also these specific topics:	-	cancer,animal products,women's health,eggs,hormones,meat,poultry,dairy,breast cancer,milk,alcohol,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular

T-378	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-disease/	cardiovascular disease	Heart disease is the #1 killer in the United States, and elevated cholesterol appears to be a primary cause. A plant-based diet is free of cholesterol and saturated animal fats; a convergence of evidence suggests that a plant-based diet may protect against and help manage and even reverse heart disease. Heart disease has been found to be almost non-existent in populations eating a diet centered around whole plant foods. The arteries of plant-based eaters may have less atherosclerotic plaque than runners and people who follow a low-carb diet.Unfortunately, with the lack of nutrition education in medical schools and the “sick population” concept that leads nutrition studies to underestimate the role of diet in disease, many doctors may be unaware of the power of nutrition to prevent and treat heart disease. Doctors’ ignorance is an important factor in the lack of information that heart patients receive on dietary interventions. This is changing, however. More doctors than ever before are informing their patients of the cardiovascular benefits of a plant-based diet.Medicare now reimburses providers for programs that treat heart disease through diet and lifestyle changes. The American Heart Association endorses seven lifestyle goals to combat heart disease. Unfortunately, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines are not as strong as they could be about heart-healthy eating, and the U.S. has yet to follow the lead of other countries that have successfully combatted heart disease.There are certain plant foods which appear to be especially protective against heart disease, especially those high in nitrates, antioxidants, fiber, and potassium. These foods include:Research shows that, in addition to good dietary choices, exercising 1 hour each day and sleeping 7 hours each night may help prevent heart disease.While vitamin C supplements and multivitamins may be of little use against heart disease, some supplements, including vitamin A, E, and beta-carotene, may actually introduce risk. Foods and chemicals associated with adverse cardiac consequences include:Alcohol appears to be protective against heart disease, but is not recommended because it increases the risk of cancer.	-	heart

T-387	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carrots/	carrots	Nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day are now recommended, and variety is important, as different vegetables may benefit different cognitive domains of the brain. Carrots are rich in beta carotene, which, when eaten in whole foods, may reduce the risk of some types of cancer. Carrots also ranked well in a study of fifteen types of vegetables in ability to bind carcinogenic bile acids, facilitating their removal from the body. Whether due to their beta carotene content, bile-binding capacity, or another factor altogether, carrot consumption was associated with a significant decrease in breast cancer risk in African-American women.Carrots are also rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, which are important for eye health, and may be responsible for the significant decrease in glaucoma risk associated with carrot consumption in populations that traditionally eat these vegetables cooked; antioxidant availability from carrots increases when cooked, regardless of cooking method. Taking advantage of this increased antioxidant value upon heating may be particularly useful because, relatively speaking, carrots are not particularly rich in antioxidants and the nutrient values of commercial crops may have declined 15% over the last 50 years. One can also increase antioxidant intake by choosing to eat regular carrots, rather than baby carrots, as they are richer in these health protective compounds.One should note, however, that fruit, vegetable, and fruit/vegetable juice consumption—including carrots and carrot juice—may have a detrimental effect on tooth enamel. Commercial carrot juice is probably best avoided altogether, as it has been found to contain benzene, a known human carcinogen.	-	fruit,vegetables,phytonutrients,cancer,beta carotene,antioxidants,women's health,vitamin C,supplements,greens,tobacco,berries,heart health,tomatoes,smoking	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/21/time-hospitals-stop-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/12/how-to-get-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/24/is-it-better-to-bake-boil-or-steam-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/13/prevent-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/25/do-vegans-get-more-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hospitals-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/crop-nutrient-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carrots-vs-baby-carrots-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industry-response-to-plants-not-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/using-the-produce-aisle-to-boost-immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benzene-in-carrot-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/citrus-peels-cancer-zest-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-canned-fruit-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/crop-nutrient-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carrots-vs-baby-carrots-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benzene-in-carrot-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beta-carotene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/juice,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/benzene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bile-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/	
T-389	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/casein/	casein	Casein is a milk protein found in human breast milk and cow’s milk.Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that typically strikes children and young adults. Both genetics and external factors play a role in the disease. Certain casein proteins break down into casomorphin. The opiate-like casomorphin from the more concentrated casein in cow’s milk may contribute to health conditions, including altering immune function and perhaps increasing susceptibility to infections that may trigger type 1 diabetes.The excessive protein in cow’s milk–based formula may set children up for obesity later in life. For example, a 2012 Journal of Nutrition study found that teens exposed to dairy proteins, such as casein, skim milk, or whey, experienced a significant increase in their body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to controls. The casein in milk may increase abdominal fat: compared to milk protein, the protein in soy prevents the increase in abdominal fat observed with the milk protein casein.Tea is associated with lower heart disease risk, but if you add milk to tea, the casein in the milk completely prevents the biological activity of the tea in terms of improvement in the function of the endothelium, which is the inner lining of our blood vessels.Casein’s opiate-like peptide casomorphin may play a role in attacks of infant apnea (when babies stop breathing) and may trigger pseudo-allergic reactions and other abnormalities seen in crib death (sudden infant death syndrome). Casamorphin in cow’s milk may have effects similar to morphine and may inhibit the respiratory center in babies’ brain stems, which could lead to abnormal breathing, apnea, and death.	-	milk,dairy,women's health,protein,children,diabetes,casomorphin,breastfeeding,green tea,soy,weight loss,tea,obesity,infants,calories	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/03/how-to-prevent-childhood-obesity-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/16/how-milk-may-contribute-to-childhood-obesity/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tea-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-casomorphin-and-crib-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-and-mucus-a-myth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soymilk-suppression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/milk-protein-vs-soy-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-casein-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/formula-for-childhood-obesity/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tea,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/abdominal-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/morphiine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/casomorphin,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endothelium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/autoimmune-diseases,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/type-1-diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/03/how-to-prevent-childhood-obesity-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/crib-death,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/sids	
T-395	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cats/	cats	The presence of cats and other furry pets in the home appears to cut the odds of acute respiratory illnesses in half, and may even decrease the risk of getting the common cold. In a study that compared the benefits of cat and dog contacts, dog contacts showed a more significant protective role on respiratory infectious disease. Though when it comes to protecting children from tummy aches, living with either cats or dogs appeared equally effective in reducing the risk of gastroenteritis.Having a cat may also be protective against cancer. One study showed that even living with a cat in the past appeared to confer some protection against developing lymphoma.Research studies are mixed about whether pets can help lower a person’s blood pressure.In a study of how people who live together share a greater similarity in gut bacteria than those who live apart, it was found that living with a cat appears to have little effect on the sharing of microbes among family members, whereas dogs appear to act like a bridge to pass bacteria back and forth between people.	-	meat,dogs,pets,children,animal products,chicken,respiratory infections,medications,viral infections,allergies,zoonotic disease,poultry,fish,fat,immune function	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/27/hives-from-tick-bite-induced-meat-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/06/which-pets-improve-childrens-health/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tick-bites-meat-allergies-and-chronic-urticaria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-cats-or-dogs-more-protective-for-childrens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pets-human-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-obesity-infectious/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/respiratory-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dogs/	
T-397	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cauliflower/	cauliflower	Disguised in meals for those less keen on cruciferous foods or eaten straight out, cauliflower is worth the effort.Cauliflower is one of the vegetables that is especially good at boosting our intestinal defenses, which may lower the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, as well as leaky gut. Cauliflower also contains a phytonutrient that acts through the Ah receptors, leads to frontline immune function against intestinal pathogens, and plays a role in boosting immune function. Bile binding—a predictor of how well a food lowers cholesterol—is another of its powers.Like other cruciferous vegetables, cauliflower is capable of providing sulforaphane, which boosts our liver’s detoxifying enzymes. The enzymatic action from eating cauliflower may also protect brain, eyesight, fight against free radicals, induce detoxification enzymes, and help prevent and treat cancer.Cauliflower was found to be protective in people suffering with gout, possibly because of the fiber, folate, and vitamin C, which appear to protect against uric acid buildup and gout.To assure that the enzyme sulforaphane is created, eat cauliflower raw or utilize the “whack and wait” technique: chop the cauliflower and wait 40 minutes—enough time to produce the enzyme—which will then be heat stable. If there is no time, all is not lost! Just sprinkle your frozen or cooked cauliflower with a little dry mustard powder which also encourages the formation of sulforaphane. Steaming of cauliflower significantly improves the bile acid binding. 	-	vegetables,broccoli,kale,cabbage,cruciferous vegetables,Brussels sprouts,plant-based diets,fruit,greens,women's health,vegans,collard greens,mortality,carrots,vegetarians	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/07/our-immune-system-uses-plants-to-activate-gut-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/29/quadrupling-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/17/how-to-get-our-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/05/beans-and-gas-clearing-the-air/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/24/cancer-and-the-animal-to-plant-protein-ratio/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-home/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/using-the-produce-aisle-to-boost-immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ah-receptor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sulforaphane/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eye-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leaky-gut-theory/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cauliflower/vitamin%20C,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mustard-powder/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bile-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/intestinal-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/steaming/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/folate/	
T-400	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cdc/	CDC	The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is a U.S. government agency focused on protecting public health. The CDC has reported on a number of research findings in order to raise public awareness of these health issues. The CDC reported the public should avoid specific fish due to the food poisoning known as ciguatera. They have also reported that the public is facing a growing health threat of antibiotic-resistant microbes in meat, including pathogens from fecal matter contamination.  The CDC says eating contaminated pork can result in Hepatitis E; intake of raw alfalfa sprouts is risky from a food safety perspective; for every reported case of Salmonella poisoning, about 38 are not reported; in 2012, Campylobacter bacteria was found to contaminate 38% of sampled chicken breasts; a 2003-04 survey found pregnant women in the U.S., on average, harbor 35 different chemicals; pork tapeworms on the brain are a growing cause of neurological disease in the U.S; 78 million Americans are not getting enough arginine, which may help the body burn fat; a higher IQ is associated with higher future earnings; green tea phytonutrient ointment may be helpful in clearing external genital warts; and eating too much salt may be deleterious to our health. Also, it was in 2002 the CDC started noting lead poisoning cases connected to Ayurvedic medications and lastly, in 2012, the CDC reported the U.S. public was eating less in vegetables and fruit than in 2002.A CDC spokesperson asked it if was reasonable that a parent lose a child because undercooked meat because the industry is trying to shift responsibility for food safety on to the consumer rather than providing a safer product.

T-401	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/celery/	celery	Celery contains beneficial antioxidants, enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. Celery actually increases in antioxidant power when it is cooked; therefore, adding celery to vegetable soup, for example, actually boosts the soup’s nutritional value.Celery adds bulk and flavor to meals while being low in calories. Researchers undertook a study to find out whether celery took more energy to digest, assimilate, and store than the calories it contains. They found that the 16 calories in about two cups of celery took 14 calories to digest, leaving two calories.  Combined with its high fiber and water content, celery is helpful in a diet for weight loss or management.Eating too much salt can contribute to health problems. In fact, four million deaths a year have been attributed to a diet high in salt. Celery provides a flavoring that can be used in place of salt.Fruits and vegetables contain phytonutrients that can boost our detoxification enzymes, modulate gene expression, and even repair DNA damage. To find out which plants might boost DNA repair, researchers tested lemons, persimmons, strawberries, oranges, choy sum, broccoli, celery, lettuce, and apples. Of those tested, the plants that provided DNA protection at low doses were celery, broccoli, apples, strawberries, lemons, and persimmons.	-	vegetables,fruit,carrots,cancer,broccoli,lettuce,onions,garlic,phytonutrients,spinach,kale,greens,weight loss,tomatoes,antioxidants	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/08/eat-protect-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/25/starving-tumors-of-their-blood-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-there-foods-with-negative-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruits-vegetables-boost-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-angiogenesis-cutting-off-tumor-supply-lines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/shaking-salt-habit/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/salt/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/

T-421	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cheese/	cheese	Cheese may contain certain ingredients of concern, for example aluminum compounds, phosphorus, industrial pollutants, titanium dioxide, uric acid, and pus cells.  In rare cases, cheese manufacturers use certain insects to give particular flavors and aromas to specific cheeses.In the United States, cheese is the number one source of saturated fat, and also contains trans fats. A high dietary saturated fat intake from foods like cheese and chicken is linked to periodontal disease. Lowering saturated fat intake may help reduce endotoxemia risk. Cheese intake has also been linked to lower sperm counts, higher inflammatory bowel disease risk, Parkinson’s disease, and cellulite formation. Eating sausage and cheese together can worsen arterial function within hours of consumption. Cheese is one of the top ten sodium contributors to the American diet and may have heterocyclic amines, a carcinogen normally connected with cooked meat, as well as putrescine. Consumers must be aware of misleading studies that suggest cheese and other foods high in saturated fat are not risky to our health.	-	dairy,heart disease,heart health,protein,plant-based

T-428	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chemotherapy/	chemotherapy	A whole-food, plant-based diet may reduce cancer risk and also has potential to treat cancer. Breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may benefit from adding phytates to their diet. Other specific plant-based foods that may help treat cancer include sweet potatoes, seaweed, strawberries, flaxseeds, amla, avocados, and soy. Turmeric seems especially helpful in treating cancers such as pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and skin cancer, perhaps due to curcumin’s ability to boost immune function.A type of fiber found in shiitake mushrooms is approved for use as adjunct chemotherapy. However, there are certainly circumstance when chemotherapy is more effective than alternative treatments in both prolonging life and boosting quality of life.Rheumatoid arthritis patients and multiple sclerosis patients sometimes use chemotherapy drugs to treat their disease, and a plant-based diet may be a safer alternative. The Swank Diet, low in saturated fat, may be particularly helpful for MS patients.A neutropenic diet (one devoid of fresh fruit and vegetables) has not been found to be beneficial in preventing infections in immune-compromised patients such as those undergoing chemotherapy. Oatmeal lotion may relieve itch and irritation caused by Cetuximab, a class of chemo drugs. Peppermint aromatherapy may help with post-chemotherapy nausea.While attempting to come up with a chemotherapy-like dose of broccoli or broccoli sprouts, researchers found them to be toxic after about 100 cups a day. The food additive red dye #3 and a few liquid smoke products may cause DNA damage comparable to chemotherapy drugs, which are designed to break down DNA. The chemotherapy drug, Taxol, comes from the bark of the Pacific yew tree.	-	cancer,complementary medicine,alternative medicine,mortality,women's health,nausea,ginger,inflammation,vomiting,cancer

T-430	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cherries/	cherries	Many kinds of fruits and vegetables exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, and red cherries are no exception. Fresh or frozen, red cherries are a nutritional powerhouse, and, as a dried fruit, red cherries rank second only to goji berries when it comes to antioxidant levels.Red cherries, which contain anthocyanin phytonutrients, are a natural COX-2 inhibitor. COX-2 is an enzyme in our stomachs that is responsible for pain and inflammation, while COX-1 protects the stomach lining. Red cherries may inhibit inflammation in our bodies more effectively than nonselective drugs (like Vioxx or ibuprofen), because these fruits suppress the COX-2 enzyme more than COX-1. Pharmaceutical drugs, on the other hand, indiscriminately target both COX 1 and COX2, which can cause internal bleeding or heart attacks.Studies have shown that as little as a half cup of cherries, or two tablespoons of cherry juice a day, may significantly lower the risk of gout, a painful inflammatory arthritis.In one study, regular cherry juice consumption even allowed gout patients to stop taking their anti-inflammatory medication. In another study, healthy individuals who ate about 45 cherries daily for a month saw a 25% reduction in C-reactive protein, which is a marker for chronic inflammation; people with higher levels of inflammation showed similar improvement after the cherry regimen. Cherry juice was found to have significant but modest improvements in sleep among older subjects with chronic insomnia. Similar results were noted when subjects ate cherries. Researchers believe it was the melatonin levels in the cherries that led to these results; please note that tart cherries have much more melatonin than sweet or dried cherries. Cherries’ inflammatory-fighting capabilities may also combat muscle soreness, the kind triggered by an overly rigorous workout.	-	inflammation,fruit,phytonutrients,juice,side effects,alternative medicine,complementary medicine,oxidative stress,muscle health,berries,antioxidants,pain,tart cherries,chronic diseases,heart health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/15/using-cherries-to-treat-gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/13/reduce-workout-soreness-with-watermelon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/08/berries-to-prevent-muscle-soreness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/28/how-to-boost-the-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/03/foods-with-natural-melatonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/08/how-to-treat-gout-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/06/which-are-more-anti-inflammatory-sweet-cherries-or-tart-cherries/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gout-with-cherry-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gout-treatment-with-a-cherry-on-top/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhanced-athletic-recovery-without-undermining-adaptation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-for-sore-muscle-relief/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-life-is-a-bowl-of-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-chocolate-milkshakes/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/juice,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tart-cherries,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/muscle-soreness,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pain/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout	
T-437	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken/	chicken	Research studies, including the largest prospective nutrition study ever, continue to suggest that industrial toxins such as dioxins, PCBs, methylmercury, and arsenic in chicken and eggs may increase the risk of cancers such as breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, penis cancer, and lymphoma. The high-temperature cooking (such as frying) of chicken can create cancer-causing compounds, which may help explain why those consuming fried chicken may be at higher prostate cancer risk (and inflammation). Barbequed chicken may be carcinogenic; and cured chicken as in deli meat may contain carcinogenic nitrosamines. Researchers study the connection between cancer and chicken viruses by looking at poultry workers, who seem more prone to cancer and neurological diseases.Eating chicken and eggs may also negatively affect emotional, mental, vascular, and hormonal health.Chicken consumption seems particularly linked to weight gain. Genetic manipulation of chickens has led to clinically obese birds, which may play a role in the human obesity epidemic due to not only their fat content, but a potential obesogenic virus that is transferable to (and among) humans.The 2010 USDA Dietary Guidelines suggested consuming less than 200mg of cholesterol per day for anyone at high cardiovascular disease risk. Chicken is a leading cholesterol source (see here, here, and here), and in some ways may be just as harmful as red meat. Comparing key measures, vegetables and fruit appear more cost-effective in nutrients than chicken and other meats. U.S. taxpayer subsidies, however, for towards lowering the price of chicken and other meats. Some studies have suggested saturated fat from animal products like chicken or processed foods is not harmful (see also here), but these studies are misleading. Intake of saturated fat is not only associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but also higher bacterial vaginosis risk and diabetes risk (see also here).Parasitic worms found in fish fed to chickens may cause allergic reactions in chicken consumers. Alkylphenols, endocrine disruptors that can be found in chicken and fish, can worsen allergies in general. Chicken is deficient in antioxidants, phytonutrients, and fiber, and may contain excessive salt, AGEs, harmane (a neurotoxin which may cause tremors), heme iron, arachidonic acid, banned medications and pesticides, glycotoxins (which may be linked with increased rates of Alzherimer’s), paralysis-causing bacteria (that can cross-contaminate other foods and surfaces) phosphate additives which may increase Campylobacter bacteria contamination risk, and can increase uric acid production,. Chicken is also associated with endotoxemia, Salmonella food poisoning (the meat industry is legally allowed to sell food contaminated with Salmonella), C. difficile, and Listeria. Fecal contamination of chicken presents a food safety risk, including human urinary tract infections. The overuse of antibiotics in chicken is creating superbugs (like MRSA), even in organic chicken.	-	meat,eggs,plant-based diets,vegans,vegetarians,dairy,heart disease,heart health,cardiovascular

T-439	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chickpeas/	chickpeas	Chickpeas are a legume, also known as garbanzo beans, Bengal gram, chana, and other names.“Longevity legumes” such as chickpeas have been used in traditional medicine to treat high blood pressure and diabetes. They contain many nutrients, antioxidants, phytochemicals, and phytates. Chickpeas contain five times more the antioxidant content when sprouted.Including chickpeas in one’s diet may reduce risk of the type of prediabetes known as metabolic syndrome. Chickpeas are anti-inflammatory and contain an abundance of non-heme iron—the safest form of iron. Chickpeas, along with other legumes, have been responsible for dropping C-reactive protein levels. Eating beans, chickpeas, split peas, or lentils at least three times a week was associated in one study with 33% less risk of colorectal polyps. 	-	beans,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,cancer,lentils,garbanzo beans,split peas,vegetables,diabetes,legumes,fruit,mortality,plant-based diets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/24/which-works-better-adding-beans-or-portion-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/21/colon-cancer-prevention-is-it-the-fiber-or-the-phytates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/25/are-canned-beans-as-healthy-as-home-cooked/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/20/how-beans-help-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/03/sprouted-lentils-healthier-canned-lentils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/12/might-turmeric-help-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slow-beating-heart-beans-vs-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-sprouting-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-beans-theyre-good-for-your-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brca-breast-cancer-genes-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-bean-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increased-lifespan-from-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooked-beans-or-sprouted-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/canned-beans-or-cooked-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/c-reactive-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/polyps/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/garbanzo-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/longevity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/metabolic-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sprouting/	
T-440	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/children/	children	Only 1 in 500 children eats the equivalent of a single leaf of Romaine lettuce a day. Most doctors are not adequately educated about nutrition to be capable of giving helpful advice to parents, who have been found to overestimate the quality of their child’s diet. Increasing children’s intake of whole fruits and vegetables can help prevent and manage the following childhood diseases: asthma, atherosclerosis, obesity, and pre-diabetes. Recent studies support several approaches for getting children to eat healthier foods in social settings and at home.Dairy consumption is strongly linked to constipation in children, as is low intake of whole plant foods. Many packaged foods contain artificial dyes that have been associated with hyperactivity in children. Aluminium has been tentatively linked to brain ailments, including Alzheimer’s; children’s main dietary exposure to aluminium is cheese and shellfish. Some teas may contain high levels of aluminium, and children should be discouraged from drinking more than one quart per day.IGF-1, a hormone found in all animal products, may be a powerful tumor-promoting agent and is associated with early onset of puberty and obesity. Xenoestrogens are associated with birth defects, preterm birth, neurobehavioral disorders, thyroid disorders, obesity, allergies, and early onset of puberty. Higher intake of soy products is associated with later onset of puberty.The processing and packaging of meat products introduce harmful compounds, including ammonia, arsenic, and nitrites, the last of which have been shown to increase the risk of childhood leukemia and brain tumors. Fecal bacteria transferred during the butchering process often contaminate meat. Even placing children in shopping carts with raw meat may be sufficient to infect them. One strain of E.Coli can create a toxin that causes acute kidney failure in children. Poultry may harbor an adenovirus suspected to promote obesity in infected children.Children are more susceptible than adults to mercury poisoning, which comes mainly from fish intake. Potential damage may include: microcephaly, delayed development, delayed cognition, and gross neurological disorders. This may partially explain the finding that vegan and vegetarian children have, on average, higher IQs.Industrial pollutants—possibly found in animal products such as fish oil supplements—are linked with thyroid disease, liver disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neuronal birth defects and endometriosis and may have detrimental effects on endocrine function and impair sexual development in boys.

T-443	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/china/	China	China and the United States lead the world in perfluorochemical exposure from food, and both nations also have the highest amount of bacteria-contaminated money.China has seen a drastic shift from a traditional plant-based diet (high in carbohydrates and fiber) to a Westernized diet increasingly composed of animal foods. A study following men from rural China transitioning to life in the US found dramatic increases in prostate cancer risk, thought due in part to the dietary change. It has been observed that African American men have a prostate cancer prevalence 120 times that of men in rural China, a figure that could in part be attributed to the traditional, more plant-based Chinese diet. Rates of diabetes in China have also skyrocketed with the introduction of a more Western diet.Rural Chinese populations regularly reveal extraordinarily low blood pressures. Ancient Chinese herbal medicines used natural components such as those found in green tea, which pharmaceutical companies are trying to replicate to create modern drugs.A lot of nutritional research comes out of China. For example, Chinese researchers showed that Vitamin B12 may be essential for good arterial health and that of all animal products, insects may be the most nutritional option—a decision echoed by the United Nations. The famous Oxford-Cornell-China Study revealed the potential for decreased inflammation (including arthritis), decreased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and coronary artery disease if a whole food plant-based diet is adopted.	-	cardiovascular disease,heart disease,plant-based diets,medications,vegans,cancer,stroke,diabetes,meat,fruit,vegetarians,cardiovascular health,chronic diseases,heart health,vegetables	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/05/dioxins-in-us-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/26/preventing-alzheimers-disease-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/19/pollutants-in-californian-breast-tissue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/18/the-vitamin-everyone-on-a-plant-based-diet-needs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tea-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-californian-breast-tissue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pesticides-in-chinese-bamboo-shoots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-matcha-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/never-too-late-to-start-eating-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-prostates-are-larger-than-others/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-acne-barberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleopoo-what-we-can-learn-from-fossilized-feces/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/never-too-late-to-start-eating-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-prostates-are-larger-than-others/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-matcha-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/18/the-vitamin-everyone-on-a-plant-based-diet-needs/	
T-446	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chlorella/	chlorella	Chlorella is unicellular freshwater green algae sold as powder or compressed into tablets. It does not have the toxins that may be present in blue-green algae or spirulina supplements. Although some adverse reactions have been reported in sensitive individuals, they were not due to toxins. For the vast majority of people, chlorella can be considered helpful.Chlorella supplementation may increase immunity. For example, chlorella supplementation appeared to prevent loss in immune function in athletes in training camp who experienced intense physical activity and group living. Athletes given a daily dose of chlorella did not experience a drop in immune function as did those who did not receive it. Another study by the World Journal of Gastroenerology was done to test the efficacy of chlorella supplementation in adults with chronic hepatitis C infection. Researchers found a significant improvement in ALT, a marker of liver inflammation, which could be explained by a beneficial immunostimulatory effect of chlorella supplementation.	-	sports medicine,respiratory infections,algae,supplements,complementary medicine,immune function,alternative medicine,athletes,exercise,side effects,psychosis,liver health,industrial pollutants,liver disease,mental health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/16/should-we-take-chlorella-to-boost-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/06/the-best-foods-test-your-nutrition-knowledge/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-hepatitis-c-with-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-athlete-immunity-with-chlorella-2/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hepatitis/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/spirulina,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/blue-green-algae,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/algae	
T-450	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chocolate/	chocolate	Chocolate usually contains added sugar and fat which may raise LDL cholesterol, while cocoa powder, which is 90+% cocoa, may have beneficial effects on arterial function and chronic fatigue syndrome. Because of the sugar and saturated fat in chocolate we should stick with using cocoa powder, especially since it has so many antioxidants. Pregnant women should therefore be cautious when consuming high anti-inflammatory foods like cocoa powder.The Kuna Indians drink over five cups of cocoa a day and have significantly lower rates of heart disease and cancer than Americans. Preliminary studies done on cocoa, however, were inconclusive as to their cardiovascular benefit..

T-453	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	cholesterol	Why do we need to lower our cholesterol? Because high levels may raise heart disease risk, the number one cause of death in the U.S.  Higher buildup of cholesterol in our blood appears to be linked to higher atherosclerosis in our coronary arteries. Cholesterol crystallization may be what causes atherosclerotic plaque rupture, the trigger for heart attacks. Regardless of total cholesterol level, LDL (low-density lipoprotein or “bad” cholesterol may be a risk factor for heart attacks.Data suggests that cholesterol levels can never be too low. The average U.S. blood cholesterol level is so high that a large part of the “normal population” is at high risk of coronary heart disease. The safe level for total cholesterol is likely 150 or lower; the optimal LDL level may be 50-70.High cholesterol may be linked to increased risk of:The American diet is so high in cholesterol-raising foods that even children may show signs of atherosclerosis. Rare genetic conditions can give people high cholesterol no matter what they eat, but for most people, poor dietary choices seem to be the main culprit behind their high cholesterol.Low carb diets seem to significantly raise “bad” cholesterol levels. For Americans, food prepared at home may have less cholesterol than food eaten at fast-food and sit-down restaurants. Eliminating saturated fat and dietary cholesterol can greatly lower cholesterol levels in the blood.A person trying to reduce cholesterol may want to be cautious of consuming meat, dairy products, chicken, and eggs. Switching from beef to chicken or fish may not lower cholesterol. Eggs may be one of the top sources of cholesterol, with just half an egg going over the safety limit.Coconut oil and non-filtered coffee may raise cholesterol levels, although olive oil and nut consumption does not seem to have an effect. Red yeast rice is not recommended, as the lovastatin dosing in it is unreliable. A plant-based diet high in fiber appears to lower total and LDL cholesterol. Unlike animal foods, plant foods do not contain dietary cholesterol.Specific foods linked to lower cholesterol include:Dr. Dean Ornish, the late Dr. Walter Kempner, and the director of the Framingham Heart Study have all promoted plant-based diets for their heart-healthy benefits. Many doctors may not be aware of this essential life-saving information, although this may be changing.Cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as statins, appear to be far less effective than generally assumed and may have side effects such as increased breast cancer risk.

T-457	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases/	chronic diseases	A plant-based diet may be able to prevent and treat diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer, prostate cancer, obesity, and hypertension. Phytonutrient rich foods are the ones most often associated with chronic disease prevention, treatment, and cure, and a healthy eating index can be calculated based on phytonutrient intake. Phytonutrients, by definition, originate only in plants. Foods high in antioxidants appear to help prevent many chronic oxidative stress diseases. Some of the best choices include: dried apple rings, goji berries, pomegranate seeds, Indian gooseberries, blackberries and green tea. The enzyme dismutase is thought to prevent the oxidation of our mitochondria and slow aging; a plant-based diet helps to boost this enzyme’s activity 300%. A study of 15,000 vegetarians found that they had lower levels of several chronic diseases as compared to the general population. This included lower rates of the following: coronary artery disease, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, and diverticulosis. But unfortunately, the prevention of chronic disease through diet and nutrition is an area of medicine in which most doctors are not trained and subsequently lack sufficient knowledge to properly advise patients (see also here). Seven out of ten deaths of Americans each year are from chronic diseases, and it is known that diet is a major factor in these deaths. Yet, efforts to require nutrition education in medical schools have met with serious opposition (see here, here, here). Multivitamins are often taken to prevent chronic diseases; unfortunately, they may actually increase the risk for breast cancer. Eggs and brains are the two most concentrated sources of cholesterol and should be avoided to prevent heart disease. And the hormones in dairy have also been associated with an increased cancer risk.	-	cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,heart health,inflammation,cancer,fruit,infertility,smoking,women's health,meat,menstruation,seaweed,men's health,lifestyle medicine	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/23/the-five-most-important-dietary-tweaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/01/improving-employee-diets-could-save-companies-millions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/13/whats-the-optimal-cholesterol-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/03/whats-the-mediterranean-diets-secret/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/24/reduce-saturated-fat-intake-to-protect-your-pancreas/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/10/medical-care-the-third-leading-cause-of-death/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-bpa-hasnt-been-banned/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-you-should-care-about-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-know-less-than-they-think-about-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tea-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lose-two-pounds-one-sitting-taking-mioscenic-route/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-nutrition-so-commercialized/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-eating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taking-personal-responsibility-for-your-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/would-taxing-unhealthy-foods-improve-public-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-for-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-story-of-nutritionfacts-org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-chronic-kidney-disease-with-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-philosophy-of-nutritionfacts-org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reductionism-deficiency-mentality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acne-cancer-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/multivitamin-supplements-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-treatment-for-angina/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-know-less-than-they-think-about-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acne-cancer-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/multivitamin-supplements-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/	
T-461	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cinnamon/	cinnamon	Cinnamon is a great source of antioxidants. As is true for a lot of spices, cinnamon provides nutrition without calories.  Some herbs and spices, including cinnamon, are so rich in antioxidants that just a small pinch can double your antioxidant intake for one meal. Cinnamon is also one of the cheapest source antioxidants you can buy.  You can try using it in this pumpkin pie recipe.Ceylon (true) cinnamon may be safer than the more common cassia (Chinese) cinnamon due to the compound, coumarin, present in cassia cinnamon which data suggests may be toxic to the liver in quantities of one or more teaspoons per day.  However, you don’t have to be concerned about getting too many oxalates as you do with turmeric. While cinnamon is chock full of antioxidants, it may not be an effective treatment for diabetes.	-	spices,antioxidants,cloves,blood sugar,diabetes,nutmeg,recipes,inflammation,ginger,medications,oregano,cancer,alternative medicine,oxidative stress,complementary medicine	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/20/the-top-four-anti-inflammatory-spices/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/27/can-we-fight-the-blues-with-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/29/cinnamon-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/23/can-antioxidant-rich-spices-counteract-the-effects-of-a-high-fat-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/27/is-caffeinated-tea-really-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/22/the-top-three-dna-protecting-spices/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-the-blues-with-greens-mao-inhibitors-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-antioxidant-superstars-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-cinnamon-for-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-cinnamon-for-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/spices,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/	
T-465	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/citrus/	citrus	Citrus, particularly lemons, may suppress the growth of cancer cells, and may help to improve the survival rates of some types of cancer. The bioflavonoids in citrus may help reduce muscle fatigue after strenuous exercise, treat dry eye disease, and may increase blood flow enough to warm the hands and feet of those with cold sensitivity. Specifically, the citrus phytonutrient, auraptene, may be effective at reducing the damage caused by industrial pollutants. Orange concentrates are a more concentrated source of potassium than bananas, and the smell of sweet orange essential oil may have anxiety-reducing properties. Citrus in conjunction with iron rich foods and the reduction of tea and coffee may be a better choice for treating iron deficiency anemia than supplements. Citrus and other antioxidants can also be effective in reducing inflammation levels.On the other hand, those eating more sour fruit may risk greatererosion of tooth enamel (especially if teeth are brushed in a softened state).  Sour fruits can enhance the absorption of iron, manganese, and aluminum. Grapefruit may increase the risk of side effects with certain drugs.  Also, the belief that grapefruit has some special fat-burning quality appears to be a myth.	-	vegetables,fruit,vitamin C,tea,supplements,women's health,phytonutrients,orange juice,sugar,berries,mortality,vegans,meat,herbal tea,fruit juice	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/06/citrus-to-reduce-muscle-fatigue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/31/does-orange-aromatherapy-reduce-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/25/starving-tumors-of-their-blood-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/08/berries-to-prevent-muscle-soreness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/12/how-grapefruit-affects-prescription-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-fiber-really-prevent-diverticulosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-angiogenesis-cutting-off-tumor-supply-lines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-gerd-acid-reflux-heartburn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-garlic-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/throw-household-products-off-the-scent/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-heart-nerve-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/club-soda-for-stomach-pain-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caution-anti-inflammatory-foods-in-the-third-trimester/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-fruits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-broccoli-and-bladder-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/citrus-peels-cancer-zest-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-canned-fruit-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocadoes-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tea,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/coffee,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-broccoli-and-bladder-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aluminum,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/

T-472	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cocacola/	Coca-Cola	Concern that one of the most commonly consumed food colorings may cause cancer has led to changes in soft drink formulation in California. Evidence from PET scans suggests brain activity changes due to the overconsumption of sugar may parallel that of drug addiction.  The consumption of phosphorus preservatives in junk food including soda may damage blood vessels, accelerate the aging process, and contribute to osteoporosis.  In response to definitive evidence showing that artificial colors may increase hyperactivity among children, a call has been made by consumer groups to ban food dyes. When combined with ascorbic acid in soda, the additive sodium benzoate can form the carcinogen, benzene.Given that obesity is a contributing cause of chronic disease in the United States, food corporations including the soft drink industry can be thought of as the new vectors of disease. Collaboration between corporations such as McDonald’s, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and the Registered Dietitian organization (formally known as the American Dietetic Association), may have influenced the ADA to publically announce that “there are no good or bad foods”.  The Coca-Cola Company even acknowledges that sugar is just empty calories with no micronutrients, yet billions in tax dollars are still used to subsidize the very foods that are making us sick.	-	soda,vegetables,industry influence,cardiovascular health,cancer,heart health,fruit,heart disease,sugar,hypertension,calories,blood pressure,cardiovascular disease,junk food,cholesterol	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-a-drink-of-water-make-children-smarter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/american-medical-association-complicity-big-tobacco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-raisins-good-snacks-for-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/collaboration-with-the-new-vectors-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reductionism-deficiency-mentality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-sugary-foods-addictive/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/american-dietetic-association/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/benzene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/collaboration-with-the-new-vectors-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-sugary-foods-addictive/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/California,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phosphorus/	
T-478	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/coconut-oil/	coconut oil	Coconut oil is one of the rare plant sources of saturated fat. The oil is extracted from the meat of mature coconuts that grow on the coconut palm. Coconut oil is not to be confused with coconut water, which is the fluid inside coconuts.Coconut oil has been shown to increase LDL, or “bad cholesterol,” which is the top risk factor for the #1 killer in the U.S., heart disease. One recent study found that coconut oil significantly worsened bad cholesterol. For people with LDL under 60 or 70, coconut oil may not be a problem.According to the Alzheimer’s Association, “There’s no scientific evidence that coconut oil helps with Alzheimer’s.” One study using a supplement of a concentrated form of the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil, purported to be the active ingredient, found no positive effects for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patients.The insecticide permethrin has been the standard treatment for head lice. Alternative treatments have been sought to avoid subjecting children to insecticides. A recent study found that a nontoxic shampoo, Paramide Plus Coconut Oil Emulsion, was 61% effective compared to the 14% of children cured with the insecticide treatments.Compared with canola, safflower, and extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil is the worst oil to deep fry with. The air pollution created produces volatile carcinogens and may pose a respiratory risk.	-	heart disease,heart health,saturated fat,cardiovascular disease,fat,cholesterol,processed foods,dementia,olive oil,Alzheimer’s disease,nutrition myths,butter,cognition,brain health,brain disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/30/is-coconut-oil-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/21/preventing-alzheimers-lifestyle-changes/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-cure-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coconut-oil-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nontoxic-head-lice-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediterranean-diet-and-atherosclerosis/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/head-lice,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/21/preventing-alzheimers-lifestyle-changes/	
T-485	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/coffee/	coffee	The new dietary guidelines for beverages recommend tea and coffee second only to water in healthfulness, but what about concerns that coffee might impair the function of our endothelium? While unfiltered coffee may raise cholesterol levels, paper filtered coffee and decaffeinated coffee doesn’t appear to; two cups a day might even increase the ability of our arteries to dilate. The same can be said about consumption of Greek (boiled) coffee. Coffee enemas as administered in a Gerson-style therapy might be of no help, though. Coffee also appears to decrease the risk of diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, Parkinson’s disease, chronic liver disease, and cancer. Unlike exposing chicken to high temperatures, roasting coffee does not seem to produce carcinogens, nor does not appear to build up benzene (unlike certain soft drinks). Although coffee has been shown to be beneficial to our health, tea is probably healthier. What about the caffeine? It may have some health-promoting properties, but pregnant women should limit their caffeine consumption. Coffee does not seem to speed up the cellular aging process, unlike fish and bacon.Coffee consumption around one to two cups a day is not associated with a change in mortality rate.	-	tea,beverages,vegetables,caffeine,chocolate,smoking,brain health,cardiovascular disease,tobacco,heart health,liver disease,cancer,liver health,exercise,safety limits	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/06/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/10/coffee-for-hepatitis-c/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/29/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/14/does-liquid-smoke-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/01/side-effects-of-aspartame-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/17/poultry-and-penis-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/10/coffee-caveats/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/23/role-caffeine-artery-function/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-and-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-something-in-tobacco-protective-against-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caffeine-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benzene-in-carrot-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-chocolate-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caution-anti-inflammatory-foods-in-the-third-trimester/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/club-soda-for-stomach-pain-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacterial-vaginosis-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-liver-cancer-with-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beverages,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dietary-guidelines,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tea,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caution-anti-inflammatory-foods-in-the-third-trimester/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/coffee-vs-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-and-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/water,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/caffeine-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-liver-cancer-with-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benzene-in-carrot-juice/	
T-486	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cognition/	cognition	Many nutrients present in plant foods may have a positive effect on cognition. Green leafy vegetables and soy beans may help improve memory. Both coffee and tea (and the caffeine they contain) are linked to positive cognitive benefits, but should probably be consumed without milk as dairy can block phytonutrient absorption. Anthocyanidins from berries may slow brain aging and improve memory; lavender extracts may alleviate generalized anxiety disorder and help with performing mental tasks; and flaxseed may contribute to better cognition in older adults. In addition to choosing the right foods, there are cognitive benefits to limiting calories altogether, and of course, getting plenty of exercise.Eating healthfully is critical for pregnant women. Numerous studies have shown that industrial pollutants such as flame retardant chemicals and mercury found in fish (such as tuna) may impair a baby’s cognitive development, and is associated with reduced cerebellum size in newborns; methylmercury contamination in fish generally outweighs DHA benefits on brain development measured as children IQ. The use of algae-based DHA supplements may offer the benefits without the risks. To stay on the safe side, mothers-to-be would have to stop eating fish at least one year before pregnancy. Licorice has also been shown to be harmful at excessive doses to the developing child. Raising the child on a plant-based diet has been associated with increased intelligence, but potentially confounding variables prevent firm conclusions. Making sure children are well hydrated may help them perform cognitively better.	-	brain health,brain disease,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,mortality,Alzheimer’s disease,aging,heart

T-494	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/collard-greens/	collard greens	Cruciferous vegetables like collard greens or kale may be especially protective against breast and kidney cancer. One explanation is that they are among the best bile acid-binding vegetables.

T-496	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-disease/	colon disease	A healthy colon starts with healthy bowel movements. High intake of plant fiber is needed for healthy bowel movements and may be associated with a decrease risk of cancer, heart disease, and numerous other chronic diseases.Though science is just beginning to unravel the complexity of our gut microbiome, it is clear that food entering the colon has profound effects on the composition and metabolic activity of these bacteria. Some species of gut bacteria appear to thrive on a high-fiber diet, while others prefer to metabolize fat or protein. The by-products of fiber fermentation, particularly butyrate, appear to have highly beneficial effects on bowel function. Butyrate and other products of fermentation are acidic, lowering the pH of stool and decreasing the ability of bile acids to form highly carcinogenic secondary bile acids.  Butyrate also helps to maintain proper intestinal barrier function, which may help decrease the risk of various auto-immune and inflammatory diseases, including Crohn’s disease.When animal protein and fat putrefy in the colon, they can produce ammonia, which can cause abnormal cell division and DNA synthesis. Luckily, the presence of fiber in the colon during protein degradation can minimize ammonia production. Long-term consumption of a plant-based diet can actually turn off the enzyme responsible for ammonia production entirely.Sulfur-containing amino acids, found highly concentrated in animal products, are metabolized by bacteria to hydrogen sulphide. This hydrogen sulfide production is associated with ulcerative colitis flare-ups and prevents our intestinal cells from properly utilizing butyrate.The sulfur-containing amino acid methionine may be carcinogenic; experiments on colon cancer cells show remarkable cancer cell death when methionine is restricted.Health-promoting bacteria also protect us from infectious diseases by competing for food with dangerous bacteria. A balanced flourishing microflora can also prevent and treat diarrhea. Healthy microflora may also help modulate weight, preventing obesity. In addition to a high-starch, high-fiber diet, regular administration of probiotic supplements can result in improvements in gut flora health; taking these supplements directly prior to or with a meal provides the greatest benefits.	-	colon health,microbiome,fiber,gut flora,plant-based diets,meat,animal products,short-chain fatty acids,Africa,vegetarians,intestinal health,colon cancer,vegans,butyrate,cancer	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/putrefying-protein-and-toxifying-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-hiatal-hernia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-oil-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cayenne-pepper-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome-and-chronic-indigestion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/microbiome-the-inside-story/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/getting-starch-to-take-the-path-of-most-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-to-take-before-a-colonoscopy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diverticulosis-when-our-most-common-gut-disorder-hardly-existed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resistant-starch-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-crohns-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-reverse-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-constipation-and-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-a-colon-cancer-mystery/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prebiotics-tending-our-inner-garden/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-bowel-movements-should-you-have-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-constipation/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-crohns-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/putrefying-protein-and-toxifying-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bowel-movements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ammonia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/microbiome-the-inside-story/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/methionine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/

T-502	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/complementary-medicine/	complementary medicine	Many modern medicines are derived from natural products such as plants, so it perhaps shouldn’t be surprising that plants themselves can have pharmacological effects. In the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, for example, the spice saffron has been found to work better than a placebo and just as well as a leading drug. Purslane has been shown to successfully treat the symptoms of oral lichen planus. Consuming rosehips may significantly reduce the pain associated with both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Flax may help prevent breast cancer, reduce cholesterol, reduce blood pressure, regulate blood sugar, and treat hot flashes and enlarged prostates. Indian gooseberries may be effective in preventing cancer. Nontoxic coconut oil emulsion shampoo works better to kill head lice than the standard insecticide treatment and eliminating artificial colorings may decrease impulsivity, inattentiveness, and hyperactivity in children. In a ranking of anti-oxidant activity among herbal teas, dandelion tea has the highest levels followed by rosehip, chamomile, lemongrass, and honeybush teas. Chamomile tea was shown to be effective in slowing the growth rates of various cancers in a petri dish. Among all teas, green tea has among the highest antioxidant levels and may help prevent cancer and even the common cold. Many nutritional supplements have been found to be useless or worse, though one might not know this speaking to health store employees who often lack the training to offer sound advice (see here, here, and here). Mangosteen juice, licorice, distilled cod liver oil, and Herbalife® supplements may all have adverse health effects. Though chlorella do not contain neurotoxins, spirulina and blue-green algae supplements might. . Ayurvedic medicine has been found to be contaminated with lead and toxic heavy metals (see also here, here). JuicePlus may be nothing more than an overpriced vitamin supplement that may even cause liver inflammation. Airborne supplements have been shown to be no better than a placebo in boosting immune response. Nasal irrigation using neti pots can be an effective treatment for sinus infections but should be sterilized between uses (with boiling water or microwaving). The current scientific consensus is that homeopathy is ineffective in treating ADHD, asthma, cancer, dementia, influenza, or in inducing labor. It also may actually be dangerous in large doses on infants.	-	alternative medicine,medications,cancer,pain,surgery,chemotherapy,weight loss,spices,cancer survival,mortality,Dr. Linus Pauling,vitamin

T-505	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/constipation/	constipation	The elimination all dairy products may be a cure for childhood constipation. Americans, and especially New Yorkers, are among the most constipated people on earth. Not surprisingly, then, constipation is the most common gastrointestinal complaint in the United States. One-third of preschoolers in the United States may be constipated in part due to the under-consumption of fiber-containing (whole plant) foods.The minimum fecal output should be about half a pound per day for cancer prevention. Larger bowel movements have also been associated with lower rates of appendicitis, colon cancer, constipation, and diverticulitis. Those who eat plant-based diets, on average, have the healthiest stools and are the most regular. This may be due to the fiber found in plants. On a traditional African diet, which consists largely of plants, constipation is essentially nonexistent.In addition to fiber, appropriate water intake could stave off constipation. Prunes may be especially helpful in treating constipation. On a plant-based, fiber-rich diet, people should be able to have an easily passable bowel movement after every meal.Women who have more frequent bowel movements appear to be at lower risk for breast cancer possibly because bile acids absorbed from our intestines concentrate in the breast and have an estrogen-like tumor promoting effect.Certain artificial sweeteners can have a laxative effect. In Latin America, greta, made almost of pure lead, is alarmingly used to treat constipation.	-	fiber,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,heart health,vegetarians,cardiovascular health,colon disease,colon health,diabetes,chronic diseases,cancer,plant-based diets,vegetables,vegans,standard American diet	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/07/how-probiotics-affect-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/03/stool-size-and-breast-cancer-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/29/where-do-you-get-your-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/11/we-can-end-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/17/prunes-metamucil-or-a-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/12/best-dried-fruit-for-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/11/a-simple-yet-neglected-cure-for-childhood-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/14/bile-acids-and-breast-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lose-two-pounds-one-sitting-taking-mioscenic-route/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-expanding-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-movement-frequency/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-reverse-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-constipation-and-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-bowel-movements-should-you-have-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/club-soda-for-stomach-pain-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diverticulosis-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-five-to-one-fiber-rule/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-movement-frequency/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-constipation-and-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bile-acids,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-bowel-movements-should-you-have-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diverticulosis-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/29/where-do-you-get-your-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-expanding-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/	
T-510	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cooking-methods/	cooking methods	In general, microwaving is among the healthiest cooking method. However, for individual vegetables, optimal cooking methods vary. Sweet potatoes boiled with the skins on may maximize nutrients. The benefits of raw broccoli can be replicated by either pre-chopping and letting it stand before cooking, or adding a little mustard seed powder after cooking. It is a myth that raw foods are always better. Steaming can increase bile acid binding ability of some vegetables. Cooked beans appear to be on par with canned and sprouted. Although some nutrients are partially destroyed by cooking, others may become more absorbable. Kale, for instance, may be healthier cooked. In fact, too many raw cruciferous vegetables can be dangerous (but only taken to an extreme).There are several carcinogens created when cooking at high temperatures, though. Deep frying may produce toxic fumes, and may also produce harmful acrylamide in French fries. Cooking animal foods may drive the production of harmful advanced glycation end-products. Frying, smoking, and other high heat methods of cooking meats also makes them particularly carcinogenic,, while boiling may be the safest. Some of these carcinogens may also be found in eggs and cheese, and it seems that no cooking method can render eggs healthy or safe. Roasting chicken produces carcinogenic HCA compounds (but not coffee or veggie burgers). Luckily just adding a side of vegetables, most notably garlic and broccoli, and a cup of tea (green is good, white is better) may help detoxify these carcinogens. Don’t like vegetables? Just spice it up!While cooking can kill Salmonella often found in store bought chicken, we often don’t clean our kitchens well enough to avoid cross contamination. Soaking and cooking will reduce the toxicity of poppy seeds. However, cooking will not kill neurotoxins found in some fish, and may only sufficiently kill pork tapeworms after a 30 day deep-freeze. Get your kids to eat more raw veggies by cutting them into star shapes.	-	meat,eggs,raw food,vegetables,cancer,antioxidants,fruit,dairy,animal

T-511	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cooking-temperature/	cooking temperature	Food safety risks associated with brain parasites such as worms (which can be linked to epilepsy), cancer-causing viruses, hepatitis E, rabies, and superbugs such as MRSA can be killed with proper cooking, though there are some bugs such as Salmonella and C. diff (getting increasingly common in pork) that are relatively heat-resistant (and there’s always a concern about cross-contamination, especially when the industry resists government controls). Endotoxins in raw or cooked animal and fermented foods may trigger inflammation that may be exacerbated by the presence of saturated fat. Handling poultry can lead to the colonization of one’s colon with antibiotic resistant E. coli that may result in bladder infections in women and cancers from exposure to oncogenic chicken viruses among poultry workers. Even with thorough cooking, though, rare neurotoxins, more common toxins, and biogenic amines in seafood as well as prions and drug residues cannot be effectively cooked out of the meat. While it is often safest to cook meat properly, certain carcinogens are actually created when muscle is cooked; green tea may protect against these heterocyclic amines. Volatile toxins may also pose a respiratory risk when released by oil when frying. Cooking with spices may enhance their DNA protection and may increase the bioavailability of some nutrients, but in extraordinary cases may increase toxicity. Smoked meats may also pose a carcinogenic risk.	-	cooking methods,safety limits,chicken,poultry,food poisoning,foodborne illness,animal products,fish,turkey,pork,colon health,milk,fecal bacteria,meat,smoking	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/14/does-liquid-smoke-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/17/meat-industry-wins-right-to-sell-tainted-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/21/clostridium-difficile-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/22/the-top-three-dna-protecting-spices/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-corpse-smell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-in-u-s-retail-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxic-megacolon-superbug/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hepatitis-e-virus-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sexually-transmitted-fish-toxin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-epilepsy-through-diet/http:/nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-epilepsy-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amnesic-seafood-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mad-fish-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-penis-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogenic-putrescine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/c-difficile-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heterocyclic-amines-in-eggs-cheese-and-creatine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-corpse-smell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-in-u-s-retail-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxic-megacolon-superbug/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hepatitis-e-virus-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sexually-transmitted-fish-toxin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-epilepsy-through-diet/http:/nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-epilepsy-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amnesic-seafood-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mad-fish-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-penis-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/e-coli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogenic-putrescine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/c-difficile-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heterocyclic-amines-in-eggs-cheese-and-creatine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/

T-515	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/corn/	corn	Corn production is heavily subsidized in order to facilitate its ubiquitous use in animal feed and high fructose corn syrup production. While consuming large amounts of corn syrup is not recommended, eating whole corn may be part of a healthful diet that lowers your stool pH thereby reducing risk of colon cancer. The prolific use of GMO Bt corn as animal feed may be the reason the insecticide can be found in the bloodstreams of pregnant women. Thankfully however, the insecticide may only be toxic to insects. Although you may get more health benefits from eating blue corn thanks to its anthocyanins, even yellow corn has more carotenoids than eggs. Corn was a major part of the traditional Ugandan diet where heart disease was almost non-existent.	-	mortality,heart disease,beans,heart health,fruit,vegetables,meat,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,cancer,grains,animal products,plant-based diets,industry influence,fiber	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/11/we-can-end-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/19/dont-forget-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/06/how-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/28/egg-consumption-and-ldl-cholesterol-size/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/25/our-tax-dollars-subsidize-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/28/gmos-safe-case-bt-corn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/08/currant-treatment-for-glaucoma/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-wrinkles-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-oatmeal-reverse-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fill-in-the-blank/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-antioxidant-superstars-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthy-food-movement-strength-in-unity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-gmos-safe-the-case-of-bt-corn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dr-burkitts-f-word-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gmos,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-gmos-safe-the-case-of-bt-corn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-fructose-corn-syrup/	
T-538	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables/	cruciferous vegetables	The best known members of the cruciferous family of vegetables are bok choy, broccoli, broccoli sprouts, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, mustard greens, radishes, turnips, and watercress.Cruciferous vegetables are considered to be a good source of antioxidants and may be able to activate a key receptor on our intestinal immune cells that helps fight pathogens and toxins. Cruciferous vegetables may boost our liver’s detoxifying enzymes, an effect that can last for weeks. The Harvard Nurse’s study reported that high consumption of cruciferous and green leafy vegetables were related to less cognitive decline.Cruciferous vegetables are considered one of the top two vegetable families that appear to aid cancer prevention (along with allium family vegetables like garlic and onions). Cruciferous vegetable intake appears to be linked to reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, breast cancer recurrence, and bladder cancer .  Broccoli may help reduce the spread of lung cancer cells.  Sulforaphane, a dietary component of cruciferous vegetables, may inhibit breast cancer stem cells.	-	vegetables,greens,beans,cancer,meat,fruit,grains,women's

T-545	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/	curcumin	Curcumin is the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric that may provide a range of health benefits.  Curcumin is noted for its safety, affordability, long-term use, and ability to target multiple cell signaling pathways. Turmeric curcumin may help reduce inflammation along with cloves, ginger, and rosemary. Curcumin may work as well or better than anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  Regular ingestion of curcumin may improve artery function similar to an hour of aerobic exercise training per day.  Curcumin may also reduce Alzheimer’s symptoms. Dramatically lower cancer rates in India may be due to their more plant-based, spice-rich diet, which often includes turmeric curcumin. Regular turmeric curcumin intake appears to significantly lower the DNA mutating ability of cancer-causing substances. Turmeric curcumin appears to be able to reprogram a number of cancer cells to self-destruct as normal cells should. Curcumin applied topically as an ointment may provide some relief against visible cancers on the skin. Turmeric curcumin may both prevent and treat colon polyps and temporarily reduce pancreatic cancer markers. A good way to boost the bioavailability of turmeric curcumin is to consume it with some black pepper. Those who are pregnant, have gallstones, or are susceptible to kidney stones may need to be cautious about their turmeric consumption.	-	turmeric,spices,inflammation,cancer,supplements,medications,curry powder,mortality,cardiovascular health,vegetables,leukemia,cardiovascular disease,heart health,heart disease,India	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/22/preventing-and-treating-colon-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/08/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/27/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/10/how-plants-can-be-both-safer-and-more-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/12/how-curry-can-kill-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/03/why-certain-plant-compounds-may-mimic-dietary-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/25/how-turmeric-can-help-combat-the-effects-of-sitting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/31/treating-pancreatic-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/12/might-turmeric-help-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/14/can-turmeric-help-with-alzheimers/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-lupus-with-turmeric-good-as-gold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/striking-root-turmeric-curcumin-ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-inflammatory-orbital-pseudotumor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-mgus-and-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-for-prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-vs-exercise-for-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenohormesis-what-doesnt-kill-plants-may-make-us-stronger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-of-gold-turmeric-vs-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/speeding-recovery-from-surgery-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogen-blocking-effects-of-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-reprogramming-cancer-cell-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ginger,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rosemary,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-vs-exercise-for-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-stones,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogen-blocking-effects-of-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-reprogramming-cancer-cell-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cloves,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/India	
T-547	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curry-powder/	curry powder	Curry powder is a blend of spices. One of its component spices, turmeric, gives some Indian dishes their distinctive golden yellow color. It’s one of many spices that can be used as a healthier alternative to salt. Turmeric has received much scientific attention in recent years due to one if its components, curcumin.Many studies suggest potential benefits of eating curry for those suffering a variety of illnesses ranging from diabetes to cancer.  While people in India have long used curry powder for pain and fatigue, scientists were only able to confirm its efficacy more recently, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients given curcumin following gallbladder surgery experienced a significant reduction in pain and fatigue. Curcumin has also been shown to reduce disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis sufferers while at the same time reducing joint tenderness and swelling. In addition, scientists have learned curcumin activates so-called “death receptors” that cause many different types of cancer cells to self-destruct, while leaving normal cells intact. Research has shown that curcumin may also reduce the number of precancerous lesions that are a precursor to colon cancer.To maximize absorption, curcumin should be eaten with a pinch of black pepper or eaten with fat, which facilitates direct absorption into the bloodstream. Bioavailability is enhanced when it’s used whole (powder or root).	-	curcumin,spices,turmeric,inflammation,cancer,India,chemotherapy,antioxidants,rectal cancer,colon cancer,supplements,kidney health,side effects,heart disease,cardiovascular disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/22/preventing-and-treating-colon-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/27/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/12/how-curry-can-kill-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/05/why-pepper-boosts-turmeric-blood-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/27/the-spice-that-helps-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/12/might-turmeric-help-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/22/the-top-three-dna-protecting-spices/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-of-gold-turmeric-vs-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-for-prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/speeding-recovery-from-surgery-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-reprogramming-cancer-cell-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogen-blocking-effects-of-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/shaking-salt-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curry-powder/Curcumin%20may%20also%20reduce%20the%20number%20of%20precancerous%20lesions%20that%20are%20a%20precursor%20to%20colon%20cancer.,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/joint-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-cancer/	
T-554	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/	dairy	The first U.S. dietary guidelines were issued in 1980 and recommended limits on saturated fat intake (found primarily in dairy), which was vehemently fought by the dairy industry. The dairy industry has sponsored groups that minimize the potential health risks of dairy consumption, using misleading studies that confuse the public into thinking saturated fat intake is not harmful. No studies financed completely by the industry had any unfavorable findings.Dairy products are not only high in saturated fat, but they are low in a number of beneficial dietary components such antioxidants, ergothioneine (an amino acid that may help protect our cells) and fiber, a nutrient that 97% of Americans are deficient in. Dairy products also contain cholesterol, trans fats, endotoxins, Neu5Ge and choline, all of which may raise the risk of inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and increased overall mortality risk.The hormones in dairy products (including skim milk) may promote acne and also contribute to risk of premature puberty, multiple pregnancies (which are riskier to both mother and children), breast cancer, prostate cancer, other hormone-dependent cancers, declining sperm counts, excess estrogen and heart disease.Industrial toxins such as dioxins, flame-retardant chemicals, PCBs, and perfluorochemicals in the dairy supply may in part account for the relationship between dairy intake and increased risk of cancer, Parkinson’s disease, lower testosterone levels and obesity. Pesticides and antibiotics can also build up in dairy fat. An analysis of the diets of California children found the top food source of lead as well as banned pesticides and dioxins was dairy products.Dairy intake is linked with a wide-ranging group of ailments including accelerated aging, being overweight, canker sores, kidney stones, childhood asthma, constipation, prediabetes and diabetes, prostate and other cancers, heart disease, imbalanced hormones, Parkinson’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, rising blood pressure, skin wrinkling, sudden infant death syndrome, ulcerative colitis, bacterial vaginosis and multiple sclerosis. Dairy intake may also impact global warming since livestock are one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.	-	meat,diabetes,milk,type 1 diabetes,autoimmune diseases,heart disease,heart

T-563	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ddt/	DDT	The insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was formally banned in the U.S. for use in 1974, but it is still in use today.Consuming fish may result in greater exposure to persistent pollutants like DDT than a plant-based diet as these compounds bioaccumulate up the food chain. Factory-raised fish generally have higher levels of DDT and other pesticides than wild-caught fish. Dairy and canned bamboo shoots from China are other food sources of DDT.The DDT half-life in the human body is as long as ten years, and DDT residues were found in 95% of mothers’ umbilical cord blood samples decades after its agricultural use was banned. The greater a woman’s exposure to the DDT metabolite, DDE, the higher the weight gain risk for their daughters. Estrogen-mimicking environmental metabolites of DDT may explain how exposure may lead to genital birth defects.	-	fish,persistent organic pollutants,industrial pollutants,meat,women's health,animal products,infants,dairy,pesticides,children,PCBs,mercury,pregnancy,poultry,dioxins	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/21/protecting-our-babies-from-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/26/how-to-counter-dietary-pollutants-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-make-your-own-fruit-and-vegetable-wash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-umbilical-cord-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pesticides-in-chinese-bamboo-shoots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-umbilical-cord-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bioaccumulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pesticides-in-chinese-bamboo-shoots/	
T-565	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dehydration/	dehydration	Drinking enough water is very important to human health. Studies suggest that dehydration may be associated with falls and fractures, heatstroke, heart disease, lung disorders, poor kidney health, bladder and colon cancer, urinary tract infections, constipation, dry mouth, cavities, decreased immune function, and cataract formation.Children also suffer the effects of dehydration. Studies have shown many children are in a state of mild, voluntary dehydration at the beginning of the school day. Significant improvement in their cognitive performance happens by simply having a drink of water.Since our brain is 75% water, hydration is extremely important for brain health. When we get dehydrated, our brain actually shrinks. Even mild dehydration has been shown to change brain function. Effects of fluid deprivation include increased sleepiness and fatigue, lower levels of vigor and alertness, and increased confusion. Drinking water can immediately reverse these symptoms, because water absorption happens rapidly – within five minutes from mouth to bloodstream. For faster hydration, cold water is absorbed about 20% faster than warm.We can also get water from other beverages, including caffeinated drinks. Black tea has been shown to offer similar hydrating properties to water, and drinking tea can include antioxidants to improve health, without adding calories. Drinking alcoholic beverages can lead to dehydration, as well as other health issues.An easy way to tell if you are dehydrated is to drink three cups of water. If your output is less than one cup, there’s a good chance you were dehydrated. Researchers recommend 4-7 cups of water per day for women and 6-11 cups per day for men.	-	water,heart disease,brain health,medications,complementary medicine,cardiovascular disease,alternative medicine,mental health,surgery,junk food,salt,sugar,vegetables,kidney health,women's health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/06/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/21/schoolchildren-should-drink-more-water/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-ice-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bottled-water-vs-tap-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-fainting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-a-drink-of-water-make-children-smarter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-fatty-foods-addictive/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-for-migraines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-dehydration-affect-our-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-aromatherapy-for-nausea/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dehydration/	
T-568	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dementia/	dementia	Four million Americans are stricken with Alzheimer’s disease, the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Possible contributing dietary factors include advanced glycation end-products (AGEs or glycotoxins; found mostly in chicken), pork tapeworms, steroid hormones in dairy, blue-green algae supplements, spirulina, copper in meat, the neurotoxin BMAA (found mostly in fish), dark fish (such as salmon), aluminum in cheese, and iron (in supplements). Poor cardiovascular health may clog cerebral arteries, cutting off blood flow to the brain and leading to the development of Alzheimer’s disease.On the other hand, coffee, tofu and other soy foods, vitamin D and B12 supplements, apples, blueberries and strawberries, saffron, turmeric, whole grains and fruits and vegetables with their component phytonutrients, and aspirin naturally found in plant foods may play a role in preventing dementia (and possibly treating). Plant-based diets in general may help prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Exercise too may help prevent and reverse mild cognitive decline.There may be a quick, non-invasive, cheap test involving smelling peanut butter which may help diagnose Alzheimer’s early on, which is

T-570	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dental-health/	dental health	Plant-based diets may help prevent oral cancer as well as gum disease. Fruits and vegetables contain a vast variety of phytonutrients that promote oral health.  For example, an apple a day has been linked with less oral cancer. The consumption of black raspberries may result in the regression of precancerous lesions in the mouth.   Cranberries have anti-proliferative effects on cancer in vitro. Within just a few weeks of eating a healthier diet, our taste buds may adjust so that healthier foods may begin to taste better. For those eating a plant-based diet, vitamin B12 supplementation is essential for oral health.Although the consumption of citrus and sour fruits may promote the erosion of tooth enamel, rinsing with water after consuming acidic foods appears to be a good preventive measure. Swishing with water may also protect tooth enamel from the natural acids found in beverages such as hibiscus tea. Rinsing with green tea may help prevent the growth of plaque bacteria without the genetic damage associated with chlorhexidine antiseptic mouthwashes. Yet children should be careful to limit their tea drinking, as the overconsumption of green tea during childhood may increase risk of dental fluorosis– or discoloration- due to its natural fluoride content. The antioxidants from lemonbalm tea may be protective against radiation-induced oxidative stress.Gargling is known to soothe sore throats, but in addition, gargling may reduce the risk of the common cold. Oral lichen planus, where the immune system starts attacking the lining of the mouth, has been successfully treated with the common plant, purslane. Amalgam fillings in our teeth contain mercury and release a certain amount every day; eating just a single can of tuna a week, though, may be the equivalent to having 29 fillings in your mouth. Bioaccumulation leads to the contamination of dairy and meat products with persistent organic pollutants, which may be linked to gum disease.  Research reveals that cow’s milk may also be linked to recurring canker sores.  Poultry workers have been found to have excess cancers of the mouth and other body parts.  For accessible cancers such as those of the mouth, the curcumin in turmeric may be topically applied to offer relief from the itching and oozing of recurrent, ulcerative lesions.	-	oral health,cardiovascular health,heart disease,heart health,cardiovascular disease,vegans,plant-based diets,cancer,vegetables,cavities,vegetarians,fruit,sugar,diabetes,beans	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/06/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/21/making-your-own-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/06/how-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-raisins-cause-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-lichen-planus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-our-taste-buds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inverted-rabbit-sign/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/club-soda-for-stomach-pain-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibacterial-toothpaste-harmful-helpful-or-harmless/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apthous-ulcer-mystery-solved/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wart-cancer-virusesin-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-lichen-planus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bioaccumulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-our-taste-buds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inverted-rabbit-sign/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/water,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oxidative-stress,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apthous-ulcer-mystery-solved/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wart-cancer-virusesin-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	
T-571	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression/	depression	Depression affects millions of people, and it may be a symptom of other health issues. For example, depression can be a symptom of gluten sensitivity, fibromyalgia, deficiency of the amino acid tryptophan, Vitamin B-12 deficiency, ciguatera poisoning, low testosterone, and pork tapeworms. Other foods associated with increased risk of depression include mercury (mostly from fish) and the artificial sweetener aspartame. Depression may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and heart disease. Plant-based diets, high in fruit and vegetable intake, may improve mood and decrease depression. This may be because plant-based diets supply lower levels of arachidonic acid, and higher levels of antioxidants. Other helpful foods when fighting and preventing depression include turmeric, saffron, probiotics, flaxseeds and walnuts, and a carbohydrate-rich evening meal. Regular physical exercise can help prevent depression, and may work better than antidepressants, which may actually not help much at all. Listening to Mozart can also decrease depression and anxiety.	-	mental health,mood,mortality,lifestyle medicine,anxiety,kidney disease,cholesterol,fish,meat,kidney health,cancer,cardiovascular

T-572	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/detoxification/	detoxification	Eating meat, including fish, is a major source of toxic pollutant exposure.  Due to potential pollutant exposure from eating fish, mothers-to-be might consider stopping fish intake one year before they intend to become pregnant.A woman’s accumulated pollutants can be passed on to her children through pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Due to the potential widespread exposure to pollutants, parents should consider starting their kids on a healthy diet.Beets, okra, and kale appear to be the best vegetables for binding toxic bile acids. Some phytochemicals help boost our liver’s detoxification enzymes. Eating berries may boost natural killer cell activity.  Regular flax seed intake provides lignans, which help with detoxification. Broccoli-family vegetables are a top source of sulforaphane, which aids our livers in the detox process.	-	cancer,women's health,heart health,heart disease,raw food,meat,pregnancy,persistent organic pollutants,PCBs,infants,industrial pollutants,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,coffee,cognition	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/23/boosting-anti-cancer-immunity-with-berries/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/miocene-meteorites-and-uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-green-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/okra,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-green-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Beets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sulforaphane,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	
T-573	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dha/	DHA	Those consuming fish and fish oil, a common supplement taken for its DHA content, may exceed the World Health Organization’s daily safety limit for dioxins and other industrial pollutants, such as PCBs. The pollutants in fish oil may increase inflammatory markers. Arachidonic acid and other pollutants found in fish may result in adverse effects on mood, which may lead to increased depression and possibly risk for suicide. Other industrial toxins in fish may include endocrine-disrupting pollutants and heavy metals such as mercury. During pregnancy, the health benefit from the DHA found in fish and fish oil, does not outweigh the possible mercury harm from eating most fish. Children’s fish oil supplements have been found to be contaminated.Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are no longer found in sufficient quantities in chickens due to genetic manipulation. Omega-3 fatty acids are therefore best obtained from pollutant-free chicken-free sources, such as microalgae-based DHA.. 	-	omega-3 fatty acids,fish,supplements,persistent organic pollutants,mercury,brain disease,brain health,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,seafood,PCBs,heart disease,EPA,fish oil,heart health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/05/the-reversal-on-fish-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-organic-salmon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-prostate-cancer-and-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegan-women-supplement-with-dha-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-brain-food-older-adults/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-dha-supplements-to-boost-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-problem-with-organic-salmon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish-oil,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heavy-metals,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Arachidonic-acid,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industrial-pollutants/	
T-576	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/	diabetes	Plant-based diets (especially whole foods) may successfully prevent, treat, and even reverse type 2 diabetes including in children.Excluding meat, milk, and other animal products and high fat and high protein foods may reduce the risk of diabetes and gestational diabetes by boosting our hormone-binding proteins, helping to prevent obesity, and reducing exposure to arsenic, BPA, dioxins, nitrites, and PCBs.Eggs may be particularly risky – eating only one egg a week may almost double the odds of getting diabetes. Fish, especially salmon, is one of the primary sources of PCBs and other industrial toxins, which may play a role in the development of diabetes.Indian gooseberries (amla), coffee, soy, flaxseeds, green tea, pulses (dried beans), chamomile tea, purple potatoes, broccoli sprouts, whole grains, vinegar, and beans may be protective. Beans may be especially beneficial when replacing meat or refined carbs, such as white rice. Cinnamon, depending on the variety, it may be either too toxic for consumption at high doses or ineffective at treating diabetes. Diabetes drugs, on the other hand, have been found to increase the risks of heart attack, heart failure, and death, and regular exercise and weight-loss may work just as well against diabetes. Erythritol is a nontoxic sugar substitute. By eating plant-based and living a healthy lifestyle, 90%-95% of type 2 diabetes is avoidable. Lifestyle medicine can work so well that it may even be able to reverse diabetic retinopathy. If left untreated, diabetes can cause blindness. Untreated type 1 diabetes can even be fatal. Babies fed baby formula seemed to have a higher risk of obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes.	-	prediabetes,meat,insulin,plant-based diets,dairy,women's health,protein,milk,pancreas

T-582	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dietary-guidelines/	dietary guidelines	The U.S. federal dietary guidelines have been challenged by the salt, sugar, dairy, egg, and meat industries since the release of the first recommendations in 1977. These fights continue today with the recent sugar industry attack on the WHO’s recommendation to limit the intake of added sugars, the egg industry fight against the American Heart Association’s recommendation to consume less eggs for heart health, and the meat industry prevention of any discussion on the scientific research for the health consequences of eating meat during the creation of the 2010 dietary guidelines. Food industries have even funded an analysis of misleadng studies in an attempt to prove that there is no significant evidence of health risk from saturated fat.Some findings have been widely adopted by the guidelines committee such as the fact that dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, and beans are excellent for optimizing diabetes control. In general, the latest U.S. guidelines are more consistent with an increasing body of research supporting the benefits of a plant-based diet in the prevention of chronic disease.For other foods, consensus is still emerging in the research, preventing the guidelines committee from making a decision on them. For example, further studies are needed to determine the daily serving size of soy, protein, and magnesium. Even though most dietary guidelines are conservative, they still highlight the shortcomings of the standard American diet. For example, the guidelines point out that less than 2% of Americans get the recommended daily intake of potassium. Some countries actually take action based on dietary guidelines: Finland carried out multiple initiatives to decrease meat consumption and experienced an 80% drop in cardiac mortality. In other cases, governments have refused to advocate for what science shows is best, like lowering the level of LDL blood cholesterol.	-	cardiovascular disease,heart disease,cardiovascular health,heart health,chronic diseases,cancer,meat,industry influence,fruit,vegetables,salt,cholesterol,processed foods,smoking,calories	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/29/where-do-you-get-your-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/19/dont-forget-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/13/whats-the-optimal-cholesterol-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/29/butter-is-back/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/29/why-some-dietary-cholesterol-studies-fail-to-show-harm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/26/how-learning-to-cook-can-save-your-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/04/how-to-design-saturated-fat-studies-to-hide-the-truth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/22/eliminate-most-of-your-chronic-disease-risk-in-four-easy-steps/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-great-protein-fiasco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turning-the-clock-back-14-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-set-up-to-fail/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-healthiest-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-versus-drugs-for-high-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-eating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increased-lifespan-from-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-cholesterol-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dr-burkitts-f-word-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-palatability-of-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-protein-recommendations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/canned-beans-or-cooked-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-canned-fruit-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-low-risk-means-high-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooking-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/shaking-salt-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-sugar-takes-on-the-world-health-organization/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-protein-recommendations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-set-up-to-fail/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-versus-drugs-for-high-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-sugar-takes-on-the-world-health-organization/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increased-lifespan-from-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-cholesterol-level/	
T-585	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins/	dioxins	Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants that can also be found in our food supply. These pollutants can persist for years in our bodies. Those eating plant-based diets appear to have the lowest levels of dioxins and other industrial pollutants. Phytonutrients found in plant foods may protect against the toxic effects of dioxins through the Ah receptor system.Most human dioxin exposure comes from eating fish such as salmon and tuna. Farmed fish have more dioxins than wild caught. In fact, human biomarkers for fish consumption now include dioxins, PCBs, and mercury. The negative health effects of dioxins and other pollutants in fish may outweigh any benefit from omega-3’s. Dioxins found in fish may be linked to increased risk of atrial fibrillation, lower sperm count and semen quality, diabetes, cancer, and impaired child neurobehavioral development. We may also be exposed to dioxins through the consumption of chicken, meat, dairy, and eggs. Dioxins found in chicken may explain the link between chicken consumption and cancer.	-	persistent organic pollutants,animal products,industrial pollutants,meat,fish,PCBs,cancer,animal fat,chicken,prediabetes,mercury,obesity,diabetes,fat,Europe	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/05/dioxins-in-us-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/11/salmon-may-be-the-greatest-source-of-dietary-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/28/dioxins-stored-in-our-own-fat-may-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/09/what-to-eat-to-reduce-our-toxic-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/28/how-to-reduce-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/05/epa-dioxin-limit-has-national-chicken-council-worried-products-could-be-declared-unfit-for-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/23/why-would-eating-fish-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/11/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lowering-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-poultry-viruses-in-human-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-fish-white-fish-dark-fish-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegan-women-supplement-with-dha-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-and-dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lowering-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/PCBs,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-fish-white-fish-dark-fish-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-and-dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/

T-590	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dna-damage/	DNA damage	Smoking and meat consumption are associated with increased DNA damage. Processed meats may contain carcinogenic nitrosamines that can even be found in the vapors from frying bacon. Smoked meats and fish capture most of the smoke’s carcinogenic compounds. Liquid smoke is not likely to be as carcinogenic as smoked foods. Cooked meats in general may cause DNA damage and have been linked with increased breast cancer risk. Heterocyclic amines found in eggs, cheese, cooked meat (including poultry and fish), and creatine may be one factor in that DNA damage. Animal fat also has the potential to increase the growth of gut bacteria that turn our bile acids into carcinogens.Plant-based diets have been associated with decreased DNA damage overall, slowed cancer growth, and possibly even slowed aging. This may be due to the high amounts of antioxidants in plant foods. Chlorophyll may also protect our DNA against carcinogens by intercepting mutations.Specific studies have shown the possible prevention or repair capabilities of apples, almonds and grapes, carob, broccoli, broccoli sprouts, legumes, dragon’s blood, garlic, green tea and white tea, coffee, purple potatoes, kiwi and other fruits, and soy (edamame, tofu, tempeh). Certain spices may be particularly beneficial in protecting against DNA damage such as turmeric, black pepper, ginger, rosemary, and tarragon (but there are concerns about a toxic compound in the latter). Ginger and lemon balm may even reduce the DNA damage caused by radiation, including radiation exposure from airline travel. Watercress may counter the DNA damage caused by high-intensity exercise. Meditation and stress management is also helpful in keeping our DNA healthy.Our risk of DNA damage through pesticide exposure by eating conventional produce is outweighed by the anti-cancer effects of eating more fruits and vegetables.	-	cancer,women's health,antioxidants,breast cancer,fruit,vegetables,phytonutrients,milk,meat,strawberries,breast health,lettuce,leukemia,apples,vitamin

T-602	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-caldwell-esselstyn/	Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn	Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn is a practitioner pioneer who showed that plant-based diets may not only stop heart disease, but reverse it.Dr. Esselstyn is best known for his landmark clinical study and follow-up book (Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease) involving patients with advanced heart disease from his practice as a heart surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic. He put the patients on a low-fat, whole-food plant-based diet. All of those who followed the diet experienced significant improvement, in some cases actual reversal of near end-stage heart disease.Since that study, Dr. Esselstyn switched to a plant-based diet himself and has worked to convince the medical profession that they should inform patients of dietary strategies for treating chronic diseases rather than assuming that they would not be willing to make changes in their diets. He reminds doctors and the public about the significant risks in heart bypass operations, including the potential to cause further heart damage, stroke, and brain dysfunction. So compelling is the evidence from his own studies and those of others that Dr. Esselstyn has called heart disease a “paper tiger” that need never exist and where it does now, need never progress.	-	heart disease,cardiovascular disease,plant-based diets,chronic diseases,cholesterol,Dr. Dean Ornish,cardiovascular health,heart health,fruit,mortality,nuts,meat,cancer,stroke,exercise	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/15/stopping-heart-disease-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/12/evidence-based-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/16/introducing-the-kempner-rice-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/02/why-do-heart-doctors-favor-surgery-and-drugs-over-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mediterranean-diet-or-a-whole-food-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-medicine-or-evidence-biased/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fully-consensual-heart-disease-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/predimed-does-eating-nuts-prevent-strokes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kempner-rice-diet-whipping-us-into-shape/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-diet-just-give-it-to-me-straight-doc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/everything-in-moderation-even-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-treatment-for-angina/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/medical-profession,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/reversing-chronic-disease	
T-606	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-dean-ornish/	Dr. Dean Ornish	For nearly 40 years, Dr. Dean Ornish has been a pioneer in the field of lifestyle medicine, demonstrating through clinical research how diet in conjunction with lifestyle changes that promote exercise and reduce stress may help reverse some of the leading causes of death in the U.S. such as coronary heart disease and perhaps even some cases, cancer.The treatment of chronic diseases in America relies heavily on medications, although there is a convergence of scientific evidence suggesting that an optimal plant-based diet may be able to help prevent prostate cancer, strokes, multiple sclerosis, sudden cardiac death, esophageal cancer, disabilities, and even reverse the cellular aging markers (See also here).Studies show that while eggs, processed meat, poultry and fish may accelerate cellular aging, plant-based diets promote telomere protection, something for which drugs cannot complete.The success of popular health fads today such as the Mediterranean Diet and Paleo Diet may have less to do with their specific food components, and more to do with their increased vegetable intake and lower processed food intake.Today Dr. Ornish and other health teams continue efforts towards national awareness and collaboration with medical professionals to promote the evidence supporting lifestyle medicine and its success over drugs and surgery in treating the underlying causes of chronic diseases.	-	plant-based diets,cardiovascular health,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular

T-618	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-neal-barnard/	Dr. Neal Barnard	Dr. Neal Barnard founded the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) in 1985. The non-profit group now consists of about 150,000 doctors and laypeople advocating the health benefits of a plant-based diet, empowering consumers and patients, promoting nutritional education for medical students and practitioners, and supporting alternatives to animal research.A prolific writer and speaker, Dr. Barnard shares research-based evidence about the dangers of the Standard American Diet, and the benefits of plant-based diets. In a campaign called “Meat is the New Tobacco,” Dr. Barnard and his organization highlighted how, until the 19080s, most doctors were bystanders, if not enablers, of smoking, and many doctors themselves smoked. But, once the full force of research about tobacco’s role in cancer and other chronic diseases was recognized by the medical community, doctors began to lead the fight against it.Dr. Barnard considers the standard American diet equivalent to the pre-1980s-smoking stage, when too many doctors enabled or at least took no action to help patients learn about and pursue diet-based interventions to fight and prevent chronic disease. Moreover, few doctors practice good nutrition in their own lives, despite the significant number of research studies demonstrating the serious risks of the Standard American Diet.	-	plant-based diets,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,heart health,Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,vegans,vegetarians,beans,exercise,grains,smoking,diabetes,weight loss,vegetables,cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/18/paula-deen-diabetes-drug-spokesperson/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-kept-secret-in-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-wait-until-your-doctor-kicks-the-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slimming-the-gecko-2/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-studies,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/physicians-committee-for-responsible-medicine/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/?fwp_search=diet+for+chronic+disease&fwp_content_type=video,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/standard-american-diet/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/	
T-633	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dried-fruit/	dried fruit	Dried fruits such as currants, cranberries and prunes offer health benefits. While fresh fruits such as blueberries are the go-to for antioxidant power, dried fruits and herbs such as Goji berries, Dragon fruit, Indian gooseberries and peppermint may provide higher antioxidant activity.Studies suggest that certain dried fruits may help fight cancer, cholesterol and insomnia. Daily dried apple consumption may promote cardiovascular health, and raisins are associated with a lower risk of premature birth and increased satiety levels in children, which could help with weight management.Indian gooseberries (amla) may be the highest antioxidant snack on earth. It may also help with diabetes and lower cholesterol.Avoid sulfites by choosing organic dried fruit. Although Amla has not been found to be contaminated with heavy metals, other fruit-based ayervedic supplements like triphala have.	-	fruit,cancer,vegetables,women's health,standard American diet,beans,meat,fiber,nuts,plant-based diets,raisins,lentils,chicken,soda,junk food	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/13/are-raisins-a-good-snack-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/17/amla-indian-gooseberries-versus-cancer-diabetes-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/24/raisins-vs-energy-gels-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/12/best-dried-fruit-for-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/31/treating-pancreatic-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/03/foods-with-natural-melatonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/19/choosing-the-best-nutrition-bar/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-raisins-cause-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-dragon-fruit-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-raisins-good-snacks-for-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-fruit-nut-bars-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-dates-figs-or-prunes-for-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-raisin-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-acne-barberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-raisins-good-snacks-for-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-fruit-nut-bars-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-dates-figs-or-prunes-for-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-raisin-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/amla,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-dragon-fruit-good-for-you/

Turkey meat may also contain dangerous amounts of the E. coli bacteria. Meat glue, an enzyme used to hold different pieces of meat together, might harbor E. coli bacteria.

T-660	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggplant/	eggplant	Eggplants are members of the nightshade family, which may be neuroprotective and help prevent Parkinson’s disease based on some not-yet-identified phytonutrient.Eggplants may also offer protection against the development of cancer, as they have been shown to have a high capacity to bind to carcinogenic bile acids, which helps remove bile acids from the body.As with nearly all vegetables, variation in preparation method may dramatically change the bioavailability of their health-promoting components; deep-frying and boiling methods that discard the cooking water generally decrease the health-promoting effects of vegetables.	-	vegetables,beets,carrots,asparagus,bell peppers,Brussels sprouts,broccoli,antioxidants,green beans,garlic,onions,celery,spinach,tomatoes,cauliflower	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppers-and-parkinsons-the-benefits-of-smoking-without-the-risks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bile-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bioavailability/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nightshades/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/frying/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/boiling/	
T-661	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/	eggs	Despite the powerful egg industry’s best efforts to put a “healthy” spin on egg consumption, eggs contain high levels of cholesterol and may contain carcinogenic retroviruses, heterocyclic amines, toxic pollutants (such as arsenic, perfluorochemicals like PCB, phthalates, flame retardant chemicals, dioxins), and Salmonella (see here and here). Consuming just one egg per day may significantly shorten our lifespans, increase the levels of the cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1, and increase our risk of heart disease, kidney stones, stroke, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and some types of cancer (such as pancreatic, breast, and prostate).Eating a plant-based diet may improve mood, lead to weight loss, lower the risk of cataracts, neurological diseases, food poisoning, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, help reverse rheumatoid arthritis, and may increase lifespan. This may be due in part to the arachidonic acid, cholesterol, sulfuric acid, choline, methionine, and sex hormones in eggs and the relative lack of antioxidant phytonutrients.	-	meat,plant-based

T-670	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endocrine-disruptors/	endocrine disruptors	Endocrine disruptors are compounds that can interfere with the body’s hormone system. Endocrine disrupting chemical pollutants can be found in meat and fish (even organic), and may be linked to early onset puberty, increased obesity risk, and lowered testosterone levels.Specific types of endocrine disrupting chemicals include: fire retardants, which may be carcinogenic and impair neurobehavioral development, xenoestrogens which can build up in animal fat and may reduce male fertility, and endocrine-disrupting alkylphenols (mostly found in fish), which may be linked to a rise in allergic diseases.Sex steroids naturally found in all animal products (but may be particularly high in pregnant cow’s milk) may increase cancer risk. These pollutants are pervasive. The CDC found that the majority of women in the U.S. are contaminated with endocrine disruptors, heavy metals, toxic solvents, fire retardant chemicals, PCBs, and pesticides, and a survey of California children exceeded cancer benchmark levels for four endocrine-disrupting pollutants. 	-	women's health,children,hormones,meat,cancer,dairy,industrial pollutants,men's health,persistent organic pollutants,plant-based diets,Europe,obesity,poultry,animal products,breast cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/13/estrogen-animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/05/how-to-suppress-the-aging-enzyme-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-organic-salmon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-bpa-hasnt-been-banned/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-adult-exposure-phthalates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-on-receipts-getting-under-our-skin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zeranol-use-in-meat-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-organic-salmon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cdc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heavy-metals,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/

Milk consumption has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Deep-fried foods such as French fries can contain acrylamide, which is generated when oil is heated; acrylamide intake has been associated with endometrial and other cancers.Soy intake may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer by up to 30%.

T-679	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/energy/	energy	Our bodies take glucose from our diets and oxygen from breathing to make the energy to fuel our brains and muscles. Our perceived level of energy relates to our mood, general happiness, and productivity.After being on a plant-based diet for five and a half months in a study looking at how an inflammation-reducing diet could affect persons with depression, a group of overweight or diabetic individuals reported increased energy, along with improved digestion, better sleep, better work productivity, and an increase in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health.In a study treating women’s painful menstrual periods with a vegan diet, the women not only had fewer cramps, but lost weight and experienced increased energy, better digestion, and better sleep.Raisins worked as well as commercial energy supplements in a study looking at replacing glycogen stores—the body’s source of quick energy—during athletic performance.Among other things, caffeine increases energy availability and expenditure, and decreases fatigue and the sense of effort associated with physical activity.Beets can enhance energy production at the subcellular level and thereby improve athletic performance. Human energy production (mitochondrial efficiency) was improved by consuming a beet-juice beveragebeet juice.Fatty and sugary foods are energy-dense foods, but eating a calorie-dense diet leads to a numbing of the dopamine response, making it harder to feel satisfied without increasing our consumption.	-	plant-based diets,vegans,vegetarians,inflammation,animal products,weight loss,mental health,fat,standard American diet,antioxidants,cholesterol,medications,soda,heart disease,animal fat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/17/treating-menstrual-pain-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/02/the-reason-we-need-more-antioxidants-and-why-were-not-getting-them/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/07/our-immune-system-uses-plants-to-activate-gut-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/28/how-fatty-foods-may-affect-our-love-life/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-diet-for-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raisins-vs-jelly-beans-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-fatty-foods-addictive/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-for-painful-menstrual-periods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/out-of-the-lab-onto-the-track/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/creatine-brain-fuel-supplementation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-dehydration-affect-our-mood/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/raisins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fatigue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/athletes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/menstruation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dopamine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/happiness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sports-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sleep/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/caffeine/	
T-687	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/enzymes/	enzymes	Certain plant phytonutrients help stimulate natural detoxifying enzymes in our bodies. Broccoli, for example, is an excellent source of sulforaphane, a phytonutrient that helps our liver to detoxify and may help fight cancer. The key for maximizing sulforaphane is to allow myrosinase enzymes to produce sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables by either eating them raw or adding myrosinase enzymes in the form of mustard powder to cooked, or pre-chopping the cruciferous vegetables, waiting at least 40 minutes, and then cooking. It is a common misconception that plant foods must be eaten raw because cooking deactivates live plant enzymes that we supposedly require.Specific plant foods may also have different affects on our enzymes. For example, COX-1 is an enzyme that helps protect our stomach lining, whereas COX-2 is an enzyme responsible for pain and inflammation. Taking aspirin may suppress the harmful COX-2, but also the helpful COX-1, while consuming cherries preferentially suppresses COX-2. Another example can be found with mushrooms; consuming five white mushrooms a day may be enough to suppress the enzyme breast cancer cells use to metastasize. One of the reasons plant-based diets protect against obesity may be because they boost the enzyme CPT, which helps burn fat.There is an enzyme called TOR which plays a role in aging. Reducing leucine by restricting animal proteins like dairy may lower TOR activity. The enzyme telomerase, on the other hand, may help rebuild telomeres and slow the aging process. 	-	vegetables,cardiovascular health,mortality,cardiovascular disease,cancer,broccoli,heart disease,cooking methods,heart health,breast cancer,cabbage,fruit,antioxidants,aging,women's health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/19/breast-cancer-stem-cells-vs-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/21/cows-milk-casomorphin-crib-death-and-autism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/18/broccoli-boosts-liver-detox-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/06/which-are-more-anti-inflammatory-sweet-cherries-or-tart-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/11/exploiting-autophagy-to-live-longer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruits-vegetables-boost-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/repairing-dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-life-is-a-bowl-of-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-upregulate-metabolism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-and-onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/miocene-meteorites-and-uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-mangosteen-juice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-we-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-vs-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/getting-starch-to-take-the-path-of-most-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pain,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/telomerase,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cherries,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aging,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-life-is-a-bowl-of-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-upregulate-metabolism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mustard-powder,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-we-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-vs-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sulforaphane,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aspirin,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mushrooms	
T-689	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/epa/	EPA	The USDA, FDA, and EPA’s mission of monitoring our food supply for drug and chemical residue contamination has yet to be fully realized. The average can of tuna in the U.S. exceeds EPA standards and may damage the brain of infants, children, and adults more than that in vaccinations, amalgam teeth fillings, high-fructose corn syrup and Ayurvedic supplements. Eliminating from the diet arachidonic acid from animal products may reduce brain inflammation and improve mood within two weeks. One in four women exceeds EPA mercury safety limits just from eating as little as one meal of fish per week. Because regulations in the U.S. allow up to ten times as much mercury in fish as EPA limit allows, it may be advisable for women who eat a lot of fish to get tested for mercury when considering pregnancy.One-third of more than sixty brands of soda tested for the carcinogen benzene exceeded EPAs safety limits. There is arsenic in American chicken products and handling poultry may transfer potentially cancer-causing viruses. Although banned decades ago, DDT is still found in products such as fish oil (even distilled is not pollutant free). Algae-based omega 3’s offer an organic, hygienic, and safer way to supplement with DHA and EPA status without heavy metal or industrial toxin exposure.	-	fish,omega-3 fatty acids,DHA,seafood,mercury,persistent organic pollutants,brain health,infants,meat,women's health,brain disease,memory,cardiovascular health,cognition,heart disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/27/mercury-testing-recommended-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/05/epa-dioxin-limit-has-national-chicken-council-worried-products-could-be-declared-unfit-for-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/04/how-seafood-can-impact-brain-development/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-best-lowers-phthalate-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-brain-food-older-adults/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury-before-considering-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nerves-of-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-prostate-cancer-and-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-brand-of-tuna-has-the-most-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tuna,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/USDA,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mercury-in-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury-before-considering-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/FDA,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nerves-of-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-brand-of-tuna-has-the-most-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/fish-fog/

T-696	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/esophageal-cancer/	esophageal cancer	In the last three decades, the incidence of esophageal cancer in the US has increased sixfold–an increase greater than that of melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer.This is likely because acid reflux is on the rise, and acid reflux can lead to inflammation, then esophagitis, then Barrett’s esophagus, and then, possibly, cancer. Numerous studies have been published on the association between Barrett’s esophagus, esophageal cancer, and diet. They found that meat and high-fat meals may increase cancer risk. Specific foods that have been shown to be associated with esophageal cancer include cured meats—like bologna, bacon, ham, and hot dogs—and eggs, because of frequent dioxin contamination. High intake of folic acid from supplements may also be associated with a significantly elevated risk of Barrett’s esophagus with precancerous changes.A higher intake of fiber may have highly protective effects against esophageal cancer. Individuals with the highest fiber intakes appear to have an approximately 30% lower risk of cancer. Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of strawberries in reversing the progression of esophageal cancer in the majority of patients.	-	cancer,meat,esophagus health,breast cancer,vegans,vegetarians,women's health,plant-based diets,fruit,vegetables,mortality,turkey,men's health,poultry,smoking	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/27/dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/17/strawberries-can-reverse-precancerous-progression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/19/black-raspberries-may-help-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/strawberries-versus-esophageal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-hiatal-hernia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-dietary-supplements-may-be-more-than-a-waste-of-money/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-gerd-acid-reflux-heartburn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-penis-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-more-nutritious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wart-cancer-virusesin-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/barretts-esophagus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/folic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/strawberries/	
T-701	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/estrogen/	estrogen	Estrogen is a steroid sex hormone. Eating a fiber-rich diet flushes excess estrogen out of the body. Some vegetables may inhibit aromatase, the enzyme used by breast cancer tumors to produce their own estrogen. Flax seeds may reduce the number of menstrual periodsa woman has, reducing lifetime estrogen exposure. Phytoestrogens, such as those found in soy products, do not appear to promote cancer. Rather, soy seems to be protective against breast cancer. Xenoestrogens (human-made environmental chemicals found contaminating fish flesh) have been linked to early puberty and low sperm counts. Eating beef from growth hormone-implanted cattle and dairy products may feed hormone-dependent cancers. Commercial cow’s milk may come from pregnant cows, who have exceptionally high hormones levels (buttermilk and skim milk are on top of the list), even when the cows are not subjected to bovine growth hormone injections. This may be why skim milk consumption is linked to acne. Many of us have microscopic cancerous tumors growing inside of us and so reducing our intake and production of growth-promoting hormones in adulthood may be useful in slowing cancer growth.	-	women's health,cancer,breast cancer,soy,hormones,phytoestrogens,supplements,Asia,mortality,breast disease,protein,Premarin,plant-based diets,men's health,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/12/gmo-soy-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/13/estrogen-animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/16/do-cholesterol-statin-drugs-cause-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/16/dietary-estrogens-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/17/organic-milk-and-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/26/why-are-chickens-fed-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/14/bile-acids-and-breast-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pomegranate-vs-placebo-for-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/morning-sickness-may-protect-mother-and-child/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zeranol-use-in-meat-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-to-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/statin-cholesterol-drugs-and-invasive-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-soy-healthy-for-breast-cancer-survivors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-most-potent-phytoestrogen-is-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-did-doctors-not-know-about-the-risks-of-hormone-therapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vitamin-d-supplements-reduce-the-risk-of-dying-from-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/hormones-in-skim-vs-whole-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/acne-cancer-connection/	
T-704	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/europe/	Europe	Europe often has more stringent rules on the safety and labeling of certain foods compared to the FDA and USDA regulations in the US. For example, the European Union requires a warning label on food products with artificial food dyes. Europe has also banned: carrageenan from infant formula, injecting hormones into farm animals, using anabolic sex steroids on farm animals to promote growth, the use of ractopamine in animal feed, injecting phosphate into meat, and alkylphenol use. Europe also has a lower allowable pus cell concentration limit for milk than the US, and a lower maximum acceptable daily intake level of the artificial sweetener aspartame. Stricter rules on the food industry may explain why in Europe, Salmonella contamination of poultry is as low as 2%, compared to a poultry contamination rate in the U.S. higher than 14%. The European food industry’s attempt to control fry times to decrease acrylamide levels has not, however, been effective. Also, U.S. grown rice may have lower arsenic levels than European-grown rice.Both Europe and the U.S. now allow a higher legal limit of the herbicide glyphosate on food and feed than they used to. The European, American, and Canadian Diabetes Associations were able to agree to recommend the consumption of dietary pulses to aid in diabetes control.Even with better regulations, Europeans face many of the same health issues as Americans. For example, the average European and American are both hypertensive by age 60, fish consumers in the U.S. and Europe may be at greater diabetes risk, their rates of multiple sclerosis, sensitive skin, and dementia are comparable to the US, and the most common type of liver cancer has been rapidly rising in both Europe and the U.S. More positively, physical activity levels have increased in both Europe and North America, and similar to doctors in the US, half of doctors in Europe have reported prescribing placebo treatments for their patients. 	-	heart disease,heart health,cardiovascular

T-708	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/	exercise	Men and women placed on a plant based diet with exercise were found to have levels of growth hormones in their blood drop dramatically, which could reduce cancer risk. Exercise (briskly walking just a few miles a day) may cut the risk of dying from heart disease in half. It appears to be possible to even reverse heart disease through diet and exercise (see here, here, here, here). Additionally, an hour of moderately intense exercise may significantly decrease breast cancer risk. And there also evidence that cancer survivors may survive longer if they exercise. Exercise has also been found to possibly reverse mild cognitive impairment and to cause bad cholesterol to drop and good cholesterol to rise (see also here). Vegans who exercise no more than meat eaters have been found to still weigh, on average, forty pounds less. In another study, even after controlling for weight and exercise, vegans had half the diabetes risk as meat eaters. Endorphins (natural pain relievers) are released during exercise. Even activities such as walking and gardening increase physical activity levels. Exercise has been found in the Harvard Nurse’s Study to extend a woman’s life (see also here). Beets have been found to boost athletic performance by possibly increasing energy extraction from oxygen (see here, here, here, here, here). Lowering blood pressure and increasing exercise tolerance may be due to vegetable nitrate intake (see here, here, here, here, here). And increased blood oxygenation (associated with increased aerobic fitness) causes increased blood redness, which may explain why skin redness (rosy glow) has been associated with increased attractiveness. Moderate alcohol consumption for a minimally healthy person who exercises for 30 minutes day has been found to have no longevity benefit. Lack of exercise is a risk factor for obesity (see also here). The economic downturn has been associated with increased exercise. Wrigleys has pointed out that chewing gum expends 11 calories/hour, but that hardly counts as exercise! Unfortunately, many doctors are not aware of the possible healing effects of lifestyle modifications such as exercise so patients may need to inform and empower themselves. Dr. Greger covers exercise in his full-length presentation, Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death, where he explores the role diet may play in preventing, treating, and even reversing our top 15 killers.	-	cancer,mortality,cardiovascular disease,heart health,cardiovascular health,heart disease,fruit,plant-based diets,meat,smoking,vegetables,supplements,breast cancer,women's health,cancer

T-713	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eye-disease/	eye disease	Plant-based diets may help prevent each of the four common causes of vision loss – namely cataracts, glaucoma (see also here and here), age-related macular degeneration (see also here) and diabetes (see also here, here, and here).

T-716	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/factory-farming-practices/	factory farming practices	Industrial animal agriculture has brought us commercial milk (including in some cases organic milk) tainted with antibiotics, manure, pus cells as well as hormones. The US meat supply has been found to be contaminated with industrial pollutants, staph bacteria, drug residues, anabolic steroids, Ractopamine , copper, parasites, and antibiotics. The often stressfull, overcrowded, unhygienic conditions has led to widespread use of nontherapeutic antibiotics by farmers to prevent animals from getting sick and to increase their growth.  This injudicious abuse of miracle drugs leads to antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Clostridium difficile,  Yersinia, and MRSA that are too often found in retail meat. The FDA estimates 80% of available antimicrobial drugs are used for farm animals. Simply living in close proximity to industrial animal farms may increase susceptibility to encountering antibiotic resistant bacteria. This is evident in slaughterhouse employees and people growing up on animal farms.Factory farmed chicken is often tainted with fecal residues as well as E. coli and arsenic. Foster Farms chicken may have infected and sickened more than 10,000 people due to this contamination. Millions of people are exposed to pathogens such as Salmonella and avian influenza each year.  More than one quarter of Salmonella found in retail chicken breasts were resistant to five or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs according to a 2013 FDA Retail Meat Report.  Antibiotic resistant E. coli from chicken has been linked to UTIs (bladder infections) in women. Even organic chicken is often infected with superbug bacteria. Eating outside of our own animal kingdom may ensure less exposure to these bugs.Because of the way the animals are raised and genetically manipulated, the meat is also high in calories and fat. Factory farmed fish may also be contaminated with industrial toxins, artificial coloring, and possibly mad cow disease prions.The FDA issued voluntary guidance to remove nontherapeutic antibiotics from farm animal production, however, it is non-binding and legally non-enforceable.  Unhealthy food is subsidized heavily to the tune of $10B.  Subsidies are often given to animal production instead of healthier options.	-	farm animals,cancer,chicken,animal products,meat,viral infections,zoonotic disease,milk,dairy,poultry,fish,bovine leukemia virus,FDA,feed

T-720	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/farm-animals/	farm animals	Farm animal exposure has been found to be a risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and poultry exposure specifically has been associated with a variety of diseases including thyroid conditions, schizophrenia, senile and pre-senile psychotic conditions, and autoimmune neurological disorders such as myasthenia gravis.Due to genetic manipulation, most of retail milk, including skim milk, now comes from pregnant cows and is, thus, high in steroid sex hormones, which may explain why vegan women have five times less chance of having twins. Due in part to the rise in industrial animal agriculture, farm animals and/or their meat have also been found to be contaminated with: Hepatitis E, E. coli, drug residues, prions, obesity causing chicken viruses, anabolic steroids, staph (Staphylococcus) bacteria, and the sarcocystis parasite. Processed meats are high in nitrites, which can form carcinogenic nitrosamines. Avian leukosis/sarcoma virus has been found in 14% of retail egg samples, though the human public health implications are unknown. Farm raised fish and chicken can high levels of toxic pollutants (dioxins), thought due to the sewer sludge fed to them. Most of the GMO soy grown in the US is fed to farm animals. Greenhouse gas emissions from farm animals may play a role in climate change.One way to promote growth in farm animals is to feed them antibiotics. This injudicious abuse of miracle drugs leads to antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Clostridium difficile and MRSA that are too often found in retail meat. The FDA estimates 80% of available antibiotics may be used for farm animals. Simply living in close proximity to industrial animal farms may increase susceptibility to encountering antibiotic resistant bacteria.

T-723	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fast-food/	fast food	The fast food industry, so embedded in our culture that preschoolers favor the taste of foods and drinks if they’re told the foods are from McDonald’s, may be considered a major threat to public health. The famous, almost exclusively plant-based, Okinawan diet in Japan that led to long and healthy lives may have been eroded by fast food restaurants, and now the islands’ inhabitants have gone from the leanest Japanese to some of the fattest, with serious health issues.A study of hamburgers from eight different fast food restaurants found that the actual meat content in the hamburgers ranged from 2% to 14.8%. An analysis of two chains’ chicken nuggets revealed that 50% or less was chicken meat. A study of the levels of heterocyclic amines in chicken samples from seven fast food restaurants revealed high levels of the carcinogen, leading the researchers to recommend that people reduce or avoid grilled chicken products in restaurants. Fast food was shown to be the second-highest risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysms.Nearly one in three children’s hospitals have a fast food restaurant inside, reminiscent of the time when cigarettes were sold in hospitals. Many have questioned the alliances of health organizations with fast food companies like Pepsi and McDonald’s. In one medical journal, several cardiologists envisioned giving away packets of statins alongside fast food meals to help reduce the health risk.	-	junk food,fruit,vegetables,processed foods,cholesterol,mortality,smoking,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,fat,weight loss,soda,meat,plant-based diets,eggs	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/10/coca-cola-stopped-sponsoring-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/20/what-do-eggs-do-to-our-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/21/time-hospitals-stop-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/26/how-learning-to-cook-can-save-your-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/21/where-are-phosphate-additives-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/24/whats-driving-americas-obesity-problem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/18/what-is-actually-in-chicken-nuggets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/23/generic-lipitor-is-not-the-answer-to-our-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-all-children-have-their-cholesterol-checked/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-the-obesity-related-plastic-chemical-bpa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-diet-soda-increase-stroke-risk-as-much-as-regular-soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hospitals-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-help-prevent-abdominal-aortic-aneurysms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-nitrates-pollutants-or-nutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-do-you-want-fries-with-that-lipitor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-cholesterol-in-the-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooking-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-exercise-to-sustain-weight-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/modern-meat-not-ahead-of-the-game/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/autopsy-of-chicken-nuggets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/japan,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-do-you-want-fries-with-that-lipitor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heterocyclic-amines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hospitals-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-help-prevent-abdominal-aortic-aneurysms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hamburgers,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/autopsy-of-chicken-nuggets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mcdonalds/

More specifically, black currants and bilberries may relieve visual fatigue associated with staring at a computer screen all day.  As for muscle fatigue, daily citrus fruit, berry, and peppermint tea consumption may help. Caffeine will also lessen fatigue.Neurotoxins found in seafood may cause a chronic fatigue-like syndrome, but chocolate may alleviate symptoms.	-	exercise,mood,junk food,depression,dairy,brain health,lifestyle medicine,mental health,plant-based diets,vegans,medications,vegetarians,processed foods,mortality,chicken	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/06/citrus-to-reduce-muscle-fatigue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/10/coffee-for-hepatitis-c/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/04/why-athletes-should-eat-nutritional-yeast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/20/can-peppermint-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/27/plant-based-diets-for-fibromyalgia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/08/drugs-vs-lifestyle-for-preventing-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/13/foods-for-computer-eye-strain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-immune-function-in-athletes-with-nutritional-yeast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-dehydration-affect-our-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-level-dynamics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatments-for-computer-eye-strain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raisins-vs-jelly-beans-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pharmacists-versus-health-food-store-employees-who-gives-better-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-treatment-for-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhancing-athletic-performance-with-peppermint/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ciguatera-poisoning-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/speeding-recovery-from-surgery-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-prediabetes-from-turning-into-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-athlete-immunity-with-chlorella-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-liver-cancer-with-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-level-dynamics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatments-for-computer-eye-strain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chocolate,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-immune-function-in-athletes-with-nutritional-yeast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-treatment-for-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhancing-athletic-performance-with-peppermint/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ciguatera-poisoning-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-prediabetes-from-turning-into-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-dehydration-affect-our-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	
T-728	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fda/	FDA	The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the federal agency responsible for enforcing public health and safety guidelines in the areas of food, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, supplements, and others.The FDA advises not to eat alfalfa sprouts; they have been linked to salmonella food poisoning (about 100 cases/year, although eggs have been linked to about 118,000/year) (see also here). Feeding arsenic to chickens and pigs has been approved by the FDA to increase the rate of weight gain. Arsenic-containing drugs are also used on factory farms to help decrease the parasite load in food animals.The agency has said that BPA, a chemical found in certain plastics, is safe. BPA has been linked to heart disease, diabetes, and liver inflammation. The FDA measured and reported benzene levels in sodas and found that more than 60% of the beverages were contaminated.The FDA refuses to ban cochineal beetle extract, made from crushed bugs, which is used as a red dye in food; it has, however, required it to be listed in the ingredients. Aspartame has been found by some to be so harmful that they are petitioning the FDA to have it pulled from the market.	-	cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,heart disease,cancer,stroke,heart health,vegetables,fruit,inflammation,meat,animal studies,eggs,diabetes,immune function,sugar	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/05/dioxins-in-us-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/10/how-plants-can-be-both-safer-and-more-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/23/latest-antibiotics-agribusiness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/10/antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/27/how-may-eating-plants-help-prevent-alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/31/treating-pancreatic-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/01/side-effects-of-aspartame-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/26/are-sugar-pills-better-than-antidepressant-drugs/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-food-using-the-tobacco-industry-playbook/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-intestines-for-food-and-cosmetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-determines-if-food-additives-are-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-and-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superbugs-in-conventional-vs-organic-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-plastics-are-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-on-receipts-getting-under-our-skin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/seeing-red-no-3-coloring-to-dye-for/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-nutrasweet%C2%AE-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-raw-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangers-of-dietary-supplement-deregulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-aspartame-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibiotics-agribusinesses-pound-of-flesh/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-canned-fruit-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-antidepressant-drugs-really-work/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-a-neutropenic-diet-necessary-for-cancer-patients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funded-research-bias/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-plastics-are-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-nutrasweet%C2%AE-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-raw-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-alfalfa-sprouts/	
T-730	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fecal-bacteria/	fecal bacteria	Salmonella causes a million cases of food poisoning each year and is the result of fecal matter contamination in chicken processing plants. Just handling chicken can lead to exposure to antibiotic resistant E. coli, which may result in bladder infections in women. Listeria is the third most common bacterial infection related to food and is found commonly in the meat supply. The phosphorus preservatives injected into poultry may not just be an arterial toxin, but may also increase the growth of Campylobacter bacteria. In 200 pork samples, more than 2/3 were contaminated with antibiotic resistant Yersinia. A representative from the USDA’s meat inspection program said pig processing lines move so quickly that “Tremendous amounts of fecal matter remain on the carcasses… not small bits, but chunks.”  C. diff. (a superbug) might not only contamination meat via fecal contamination, but may transfer spores from the gut into the muscles (meat) of the animal.In Supreme Beef vs. USDA, a federal appeals court found it was not illegal to sell contaminated meat, as cooking the meat kills the bacteria. Particularly in the case of poultry, cooking the meat may kill the bacteria, but there is a large risk of cross contamination in the preparation of the poultry.  Those who eat meat risk food poisoning from undercooked meat, but also exposure to cooked meat carcinogens in well-cooked meat.The “meat glue” enzyme, transglutaminase, is widely used in the US and may increase E. Coli contamination. The foreign meat molecule, Neu5Gc, may not only contribute to the progression of cancer and heart disease, but can set children up for life-threatening reactions to E. Coli toxins.Organic produce may be contaminated with fecal pathogens due to noroviruses linked to produce from the use of pesticides in water sprayed on crops contaminated with fecal matter.	-	poultry,chicken,food poisoning,foodborne illness,fecal contamination,meat,turkey,Salmonella,USDA,animal protein,industry influence,vegans,vegetables,farm animals,plant-based diets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/20/how-to-prevent-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/16/what-is-meat-glue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/18/what-is-actually-in-chicken-nuggets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/16/phosphate-additives-in-chicken-banned-elsewhere/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/17/meat-industry-wins-right-to-sell-tainted-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/28/how-avoiding-chicken-could-prevent-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/21/clostridium-difficile-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/12/chicken-salmonella-outbreaks-show-food-safety-systems-failure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/10/viral-food-poisoning-from-pesticides/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/c-difficile-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foster-farms-responds-to-chicken-salmonella-outbreaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-may-exceed-daily-allowance-of-irony/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-meat-glue-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zero-tolerance-to-acceptable-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/norovirus-food-poisoning-from-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/autopsy-of-chicken-nuggets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-may-exceed-daily-allowance-of-irony/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-meat-glue-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/e-coli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phosphorus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/campylobacter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Organic-foods,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/c-difficile-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/usda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/yersinia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foster-farms-responds-to-chicken-salmonella-outbreaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zero-tolerance-to-acceptable-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/norovirus-food-poisoning-from-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/autopsy-of-chicken-nuggets/	
T-735	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/feed-additives/	feed additives	The FDA issued voluntary guidance to remove antibiotics from farm animal feed, however, it is non-binding and legally non-enforceable, so 80% of available antibiotics may still be squandered on farm animals.  Mass feeding of antibiotics to livestock is directly linked to antibiotic resistant bacteria infections in humans. Clostridium difficile is one of the superbugs found in the U.S. meat supply (including up to 42% of poultry sampled), and may be even more dangerous than MRSA.Dioxins are highly toxic pollutants that may be found in contaminated feed fed to chickens and farm-raised fish.  Canthoxanthine feed additives given to farmed fish may be linked to gold dust retinopathy. The poultry industry feeds their birds millions of pounds of arsenic-containing drugs every year, ending up in chickens and feathers (which is used along other unusable chicken parts to feed back to farm animals). Estrogen levels found in this chicken litter fed back to chickens may trigger premature development in consumers. Researchers in Greece fed infected cow brains to farm fish and found evidence mad cow-like changes in the fish.Bacteria-eating viruses have been approved as meat additives to reduce the risk of Listeria and Campylobacter found in processed meat and poultry products. Most GMO soy grown in the US is fed to farm animals. The egg industry is attempting to improve the fatty acid lipid profile of eggs by feeding blubber from the Canadian harp seal hunt to laying hens to lower their arachidonic acid level. Government subsidies of livestock feed keep these unhealthy products so cheap.	-	chicken,poultry,meat,farm animals,fish,cancer,animal products,women's health,estrogen,industry influence,dairy,factory farming practices,eggs,Europe,turkey	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/12/gmo-soy-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/05/dioxins-in-us-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/14/how-chemically-contaminated-are-we/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/23/latest-antibiotics-agribusiness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/13/estrogen-animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/10/antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/25/our-tax-dollars-subsidize-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/26/why-are-chickens-fed-prozac/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxic-megacolon-superbug/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-superbugs-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mythcrushers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibiotics-agribusinesses-pound-of-flesh/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mad-fish-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zeranol-use-in-meat-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chickens-fate-is-sealed/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxic-megacolon-superbug/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antibiotics,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mythcrushers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mrsa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/listeria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibiotics-agribusinesses-pound-of-flesh/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mad-fish-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chickens-fate-is-sealed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/campylobacter/	
T-740	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fertility/	fertility	Fish and other seafood intake may introduce hormones and other pollutants that interfere with male fertility by lowering sperm count and sperm quality, even if the exposure occurs in infancy. Hormones in meat, especially chicken, may be associated with ovulatory infertility in women; consumption during pregnancy may alter testicular development of a male fetus and produce behavioral disorders. Hormones in cow’s milk may be the reason that women on a conventional diet have five times the rate of twin births than vegan women. Soy hormones do not decrease sperm count and, in fact, vegetable protein increases fertility. But non-GMO soy is commonly contaminated with Monsanto’s Roundup which may disrupt embryonic development of rat testicles.	-	men's health,cancer,reproductive health,hormones,milk,infertility,obesity,breast cancer,women's health,diabetes,endocrine disruptors,fat,immune function,animal products,fish	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/07/monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/10/25/what-should-women-eat-to-live-longest/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-benefits-of-caloric-restriction-without-the-actual-restricting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-bpa-hasnt-been-banned/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/striking-root-turmeric-curcumin-ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vit-d-supplements-help-diabetes-weight-loss-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ergothioneine-a-new-vitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-hormones-male-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-hormones-male-infertility/	
T-742	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/	fiber	The under-consumption of unrefined plant foods in our diet has resulted in a low fiber intake. The standard American diet is highly lacking in fiber. Sadly, one-third of preschoolers have been found to be constipated. Nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day at a minimum are recommended. Fiber causes an increase in stool size, which has been associated with a decreased cancer risk, specifically colon cancer, as well as lower risk of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, appendicitis, constipation, and diverticulitis.A plant-based diet high in fiber can flush excess estrogen and cholesterol out of the system. This may help explain why high fiber intake is associated with reduced breast cancer risk. The target minimum fecal output is about half a pound a day. The amount of time it takes food to travel through the body perhaps ideally should be 24-36 hours. And at the same fiber intake, antioxidant rich foods reduce inflammation better than less nutrient-dense foods.Foods relatively rich in fiber include: dates (date sugar has fiber since it’s just powdered dates), chia seeds, flax seeds, veggie chicken, flaked coconut, dark green leafy vegetables, and beans.It used to be thought that fiber just passed through us with no effect other than providing bulk. However, it is now known that metabolites are actively produced by our gut bacteria that eat fiber. These compounds may have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-obesity and blood sugar control effects. Fiber has also been found to bind nutrients, so if you juice, you are losing more than just the fiber. Smoothies on the other hand allows for greater absorption of nutrients, although depending on what is in the smoothie, disrupting the fiber may lead to a higher insulin spike.High fiber diets may also reduce the risk of stroke, high cholesterol and potentially heart disease.Fiber intake also has possible benefits for hiatal hernia, brain loss, kidney stones, COPD, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, weight loss, improved immunity, and ultimately increased longevity, possibly because fiber may help mimic some of the benefits of calorie restriction.	-	fruit,plant-based

T-751	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish/	fish	Many individuals consider fish a superior source of protein to animal products or poultry. But like meat, fish is low in antioxidants and phytonutrients and contains cholesterol. It is also high in methionine, an amino acid that appears to aid in cancer tumor growth, and may contribute to longevity-related oxidation in the body.Fish is a leading source of industrial pollutants such as mercury, dioxins, neurotoxins, arsenic, DDT, putrescine, AGE’s, PCB’s, PDBE’s, alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and even prescription drugs that end up in rivers and streams. Smoked food products amplify cancer-related dangers, with smoked salmon being the worst of all tested smoked foods.Fish consumption has been linked to a wide range of conditions including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), type 2 diabetes, kidney stones, atrial fibrillation, lower IQs among children, smaller infant brain size, shortened telomeres, which are a sign of aging, lower sperm counts, lower testosterone, more symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and earlier puberty.Fish consumption is also responsible for parasitic fish worm allergies, gold dust retinopathy, mad fish disease, food poisoning from fish toxins, chemical obesogens that may cause obesity, neurotoxic substances that are magnified when farmed fish are fed animal products, fish-induced keriorrhea, a form of amnesia, cataracts, ciguatera poisoning and the fecal contamination of sushi. Eating organic or even wild caught fish may not significantly lower industrial pollutant exposure. Analysis of fish oil capsules has revealed toxic contaminants, which may counteract the benefit of the omega-3 fatty acids. So advice to eat oily fish or take fish oil capsules to lower risk of heart disease, stroke or mortality is no longer supported by the balance of available evidence.Plant-based diets that depend on plant-derived omega-3 supplements provide the benefits without the contaminants. Long-chain omega 3s, found in golden algae, are bioequivalent to fish DHA; they’re also a far more sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly way to get one’s omega 3s.	-	plant-based diets,meat,vegans,high blood pressure,blood pressure,vegetarians,poultry,vegetables,animal products,hypertension,eggs,dairy,fruit,heart disease,mortality	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/22/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-and-fish-food-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/21/foods-linked-to-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/28/white-meat-may-be-as-cholesterol-raising-as-red/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/08/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-help-reduce-brain-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-diet-may-affect-stress-responses-in-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-best-lowers-phthalate-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-and-the-eskimo-fish-tale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-the-obesity-related-plastic-chemical-bpa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-brain-food-older-adults/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/morning-sickness-may-protect-mother-and-child/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-dha-supplements-to-boost-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-miso-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increasing-protein-intake-age-65/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-vinegar-help-with-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industrial-pollutants/	
T-752	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish-oil/	fish oil	Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for human health. For example, they are crucial for proper brain function and also may support joint health by reducing inflammation. Fish oil supplements (including distilled versions and cod liver oil) contain the long chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA but may also contain persistent organic pollutants such as PCB (see also here) and DDT, as well as toxic elements such as arsenic and mercury (see a mercury comparison between vaccines and tuna here). Dark fish (such as salmon) consumption may be particularly problematic. Because of these high levels of pollutants in fish, mercury levels in hair samples and arsenic levels in blood samples can now be used as biomarkers that can estimate a person’s past fish consumption. The good news is that we can get all the omega-3s we need from plants. However, the omega-3 fatty acid most commonly found in plant foods is the short chain omega 3 ALA (alpha-linolenic acid). The body can lengthen ALA into EPA and DHA, but it may not convert enough for optimal health. Therefore, an fish-free DHA and/or EPA supplement may be a good idea. These plant-based supplements may provide all the benefits without the contaminants.	-	fish,omega-3 fatty acids,supplements,heart disease,heart health,persistent organic pollutants,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,DHA,PCBs,seafood,mortality,cancer,cod liver oil,salmon	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/05/the-reversal-on-fish-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/05/epa-dioxin-limit-has-national-chicken-council-worried-products-could-be-declared-unfit-for-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/23/why-would-eating-fish-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-vitamin-d-should-you-take/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-and-the-eskimo-fish-tale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-intake-biomarker/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-prostate-cancer-and-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-pcb-chemical-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-fish-white-fish-dark-fish-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-cod-liver-oil-good-for-you/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/biomarkers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/epa/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/food-sources-of-pcb-chemical-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arsenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/fish-intake-biomarker/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-cod-liver-oil-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-fish-white-fish-dark-fish-atrial-fibrillation/	
T-756	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flavonoids/	flavonoids	Flavonoids are a group of antioxidant phytonutrients that, along with carotenoids, are responsible for the vivid colors in fruits and vegetables. Flavonoids also appear to contribute important health benefits.There are more than 5,000 different flavonoids in the plants we eat. Flavonoids are found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. They are plentiful in cocoa powder and, to a lesser extent, in other types of chocolate. Some flavonoids, like quercitin, are widespread in plant-based foods. Others are only found in certain food groups; hesperidin, for example, shown to increase blood flow, is mainly found in citrus fruits. In one study, researchers discovered that test subjects who drank two cups of orange juice had more improved blood flow compared to those who were given only the hesperidin that would be found in two cups of orange juice.The isoflavones (a type of flavonoid) found in soy may help lower cancer risk. Scientists believe flavonoids may prevent tumors from releasing angiogenic chemicals that spur the growth of new blood vessels that feed tumors. Phytonutrients in tea, spices, fruit, berries, broccoli and beans can suppress angiogenesis. In another study, researchers found that plant phytonutrients reduced DNA damage caused by consumption of meat mutagens in animal protein.Researchers who followed a group of 1,800 healthy individuals for eight years found that those who drank fruit and vegetable juice had a 76% lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Certain flavonoid phytonutrients in an in vitro study not only inhibited the spider web-like formation of synuclein fibers, which appear to play a role in Parkinson’s disease, but some could even break them up.Flavonoid phytonutrients in fruits, vegetables and beans appear to inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase, which leads to the formation of free radicals during exercise. Berries may reduce inflammatory muscle damage, and greens may reduce free radical DNA damage, with dark chocolate and tomato juice offering similar effects. Cherries or cherry juice appear to alleviate exercise-induced muscle damage and associated muscle soreness.	-	phytonutrients,fruit,berries,citrus,juice,exercise,women's health,fruit juice,plant-based diets,weight loss,cancer survival,cancer,isoflavones,vegetables,DNA damage	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/25/starving-tumors-of-their-blood-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/08/berries-to-prevent-muscle-soreness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/28/how-to-boost-the-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/03/burning-fat-with-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/09/blocking-cancer-formation-green-tea-garlic/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-chocolate-fix/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhanced-athletic-recovery-without-undermining-adaptation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-garlic-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-angiogenesis-cutting-off-tumor-supply-lines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hesperidin/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parkinsons-disease/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carotenoid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/orange-juice,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/quercitin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/isoflavones/	
T-759	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flax-seeds/	flax seeds	Flax is the #1 whole-food source of lignans with 800 times more lignans than any other food. The phytonutrient is associated with prolonged survival in cancer patients, especially breast cancer. Flax seeds may be beneficial in suppressing the growth of breast and prostate cancers because when consumed, tumor cell proliferation drops, cancer cell death increases and the c-erbB2 score is reduced. Combining flax with dietary fat restriction may have an even greater effect on prostate cancer.Scientists interested in looking at flaxseed’s cancer prevention powers studied women at high risk of breast cancer. National Health Institute researchers added a teaspoon of ground flaxseed to their daily diet; after a year, they saw lower expression of a proliferation biomarker associated with cancer.Eating only one tablespoon of ground flaxseed daily may help prevent and reverse diabetes. One study showed that a tablespoon of ground flaxseed daily led to a significant drop in fasting blood sugars, triglycerides, and cholesterol, as well as A1C level.  Researchers believe flaxseed may improve insulin sensitivity in people with glucose intolerance.Eating flax seeds may also diminish skin sensitivity and improve skin barrier function and condition. In one study, daily flaxseed was shown to reduce high blood pressure as good or better than any other nutritional intervention and as effectively as many hypertension drugs, which can have serious side effects.Those interested in adding flaxseed to their diet should note that lignans are activated by gut bacteria, so taking antibiotics may impair the production of the lignans.In addition to their specific cancer- and diabetes-fighting properties, flaxseeds are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, iron, zinc, calcium, protein, potassium, magnesium, folate, soluble fiber and even boron.	-	cancer,women's health,plant-based diets,fiber,breast cancer,vegetables,cardiovascular disease,fruit,heart health,cardiovascular health,heart disease,fat,mortality,meat,cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/17/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/05/treating-an-enlarged-prostate-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/26/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/01/flax-seeds-can-have-profound-effect-on-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/12/who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/14/breast-cancer-cells-feed-on-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/03/foods-with-natural-melatonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/05/how-to-treat-prediabetes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/12/treating-breast-pain-with-flax-seeds/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/was-it-the-flaxseed-fat-restriction-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-for-sensitive-skin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fill-in-the-blank/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-flax-seeds-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-feeds-breast-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-vs-chia-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-great-bad-killer-fats/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-epidemiological-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-clinical-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-cholesterol-fighters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-is-the-standard-of-care-for-prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-fine-kettle-of-fluoxetine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrient,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/potassium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lignans/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/17/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/calcium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lignans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/folate,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/skin-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/zinc,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/boron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/microbiome,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-blood-pressure,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iron	
T-761	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flexitarians/	flexitarians	A “flexitarian” is a “flexible vegetarian,” meaning someone who eats meat sparingly. Various studies tells us that this strategy for health is better than the standard American diet, but may not be as optimal as an even more whole-food, plant-based diet. This is partially due to higher cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fat intake compared to vegans. Switching from eating beef to consuming chicken or fish does not lower cholesterol. The largest study ever indicated that meat intake may increase total mortality, the risk of developing diabetes and prediabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, heart disease, cataracts, fibromyalgia, lymphoma, metabolic syndrome, and many other common diseases. Although flexitarians do live longer than those eating the standard American diet, vegetarians live longer than flexitarians, as long as they get enough B12. Plant-based diets contain more than enough protein and often provide more nutrients than omnivorous diets.Those eating whole-food, plant-based diets have significantly lower levels of IGF-1, steroid sex hormones, and industrial pollutants than those just eating vegetarian. Cutting down on meat may also be better for the environment.	-	vegetarians,plant-based diets,vegans,vegetables,meat,heart health,animal products,eggs,fish,animal protein,dairy,animal fat,mortality,cardiovascular health,heart disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/29/where-do-you-get-your-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/15/stopping-heart-disease-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/12/how-grapefruit-affects-prescription-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/10/how-plant-based-diets-may-extend-our-lives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/28/white-meat-may-be-as-cholesterol-raising-as-red/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-meat-or-no-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/daily-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-sex-hormone-binding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saturated-fat-cancer-progression-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/metabolic-syndrome-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-palatability-of-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension-strategy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-climate-change-cooking-up-a-storm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-meat-or-no-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-sex-hormone-binding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saturated-fat-cancer-progression-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/standard-american-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/metabolic-syndrome-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beef,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-climate-change-cooking-up-a-storm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/

T-770	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/food-additives/	food additives	A small number of food additives have been found to be harmless or even healthy. Those in the “harmless” category include MSG, citric acid, stevia (in limited amounts), and erythritol. Of all added sweeteners, only date sugar and molasses are considered to be health-promoting. Black pepper and gum arabic appear to offer health benefits.Many food additives may be harmful to human health such as nitrate, a carcinogenic substance found abundantly in hot dogs and cured meats. Another dangerous additive is phosphate, found mostly in chicken meat. Other harmful additives include the preservatives sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, sulfites, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, arsenic compounds, and coumarin (which has been banned). Diacetyl, an artificial flavoring for popcorn, and most types of artificial coloring (found in farmed fish as well) have been linked to disease risk. Red dye number 3 has been associated with ADHD symptoms in children, cancer, and liver and thyroid diseases. Aluminum, found in many cheeses, the “fortifying” nutrient folic acid, and flavor additives salt, corn syrup, and NutraSweet also introduce health risks.  Some additives have themselves been found to be contaminated with mercury. The meat industry is currently considering additives to try to make meat safer.	-	cancer,carcinogens,meat,industry influence,FDA,plant-based diets,children,soda,heart disease,beverages,Coca-Cola,diabetes,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,artificial colors	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/23/reducing-arsenic-in-chicken-and-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/13/does-caramel-color-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/14/what-do-meat-purge-and-cola-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/21/where-are-phosphate-additives-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/29/avoid-butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/16/phosphate-additives-in-chicken-banned-elsewhere/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/10/food-dyes-and-adhd/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-nutrasweet-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/miocene-meteorites-and-uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-additives-to-diminish-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-potassium-sorbate-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zeranol-use-in-meat-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/seeing-red-no-3-coloring-to-dye-for/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangers-of-dietary-supplement-deregulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-nutrasweet-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-citric-acid-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phosphate,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/can-folic-acid-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/sugar-vs-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-additives-to-diminish-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mercury-in-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-potassium-sorbate-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-msg-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nitrates,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/does-tofu-cause-dementia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/seeing-red-no-3-coloring-to-dye-for/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-artificial-butter-flavor-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-black-pepper-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/aluminum-in-vaccines-vs-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-gum-arabic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/molasses,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/	
T-775	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/foodborne-illness/	foodborne illness	What people think of as “stomach flu” is typically food poisoning. Hand-washing is critical after handling raw meat and fish, although even washing carefully with bleach and soapy water may not eliminate the threat of Salmonella and Campylobacter from raw chicken. C. diff, the superbug associated with pseudomembraneous colitis and toxic megacolon, was found in 42% of U.S. retail meat in one study. The superbug MRSA also affects the U.S. meat supply (see also here). Nearly half of retail meat for sale in the United States was found contaminated with staph in general. Meat is not only the #1 source of toxin-producing E. Coli, but also contains Neu5Gc, a protein which allows the bacteria to enter human cells more easily. Adding phosphates may increase the amount of pathogenic bacteria in meat. Even placing children in the basket of a shopping cart with raw meat could pose a danger. Poultry is the #1 cause of food poisoning, and ever since the end of the Clinton administration, the incidence of Salmonella poisoning is on the rise. One study found that nine out of ten packaged chicken are contaminated with fecal matter. Viruses from poultry may even be associated with neurological diseases, and bacteria from poultry have been associated with paralysis (see also here). Extra-intestinal E. coli, found in almost half of all retail poultry samples tested, may cause urinary tract infections. Pork tapeworms infecting one’s brain is the leading cause of adult-onset epilepsy. 90% of Yersinia, a foodborne illness from pork, may be antibiotic resistant. The hepatitis E virus is carried in the livers and bloodstreams of pigs and is transmitted through feces and by eating undercooked pork. There are a number of heat-stable toxins in fish that can cause food poisoning (some of which may even be sexually transmitted). We can get cholera from raw oysters; tapeworms, brainworms, and eyeworms, and a rare form of amnesia from sushi. Fecal microbes are not just found on animal products: several brands of bottled water and water sprayed on crops have shown bacterial contamination. Salmonella has been found in alfalfa sprouts, so broccoli sprouts are safer. Sea vegetables are an excellent source of iodine, but eating kelp (and sausages containing thyroid glands) can lead to iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis. Eggs cause an eggborne epidemic of Salmonella, sickening more than 100,000 Americans every year.	-	food poisoning,meat,cancer,women's health,poultry,vegetables,antioxidants,fruit,eggs,breast

T-791	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/	fruit	Most Americans don’t eat enough fruit, with only 3% of calories coming from fruit on average. One study estimated that greater worldwide fruit intake could save an additional 4.9 million lives each year. Greater fruit intake appears to help lower the risk for heart disease and cancer mortality, as well as help extend overall lifespan. Nutritional problems of fructose and sugar seem to come when they are added to foods, but not as a natural part of whole fruit.Whole fruit raises fiber intake, which helps slow the rate of fruit sugar absorption into the bloodstream—a key reason why whole fruit is almost always better than fruit juice. Smoothies made from whole plant foods helps boost fruit and vegetable intake, although eating whole fruit may be more filling than consuming the same amount in a smoothie.To get a full range of phytonutrients and the best phytonutrient absorption, one should eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, both raw and cooked. Fruits contain antioxidants, magnesium, and other minerals. There appear to be no consistent differences in the levels of vitamins and minerals in organic versus conventionally grown produce, but organic fruits and vegetables have more phenolic phytonutrients. The preservative sulfur dioxide can be avoided by buying organic dried fruit.Obesity-causing pollutants found in fish are found in significantly lower levels in fruits and vegetables. One should wash fruit to reduce pesticide residues and noroviruses. Those eating sour fruit may risk tooth enamel erosion, but rinsing with water after eating should reduce the risk. One study found that higher intake of high-fiber foods, especially fruits, may slow down periodontal disease progression. Fruit intake may help lower the risk of:Fruit intake may have positive effects

T-793	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit-juice/	fruit juice	The fructose found in fruit juice may not produce the same insulin spike as “industrial fructose” (table sugar and high fructose corn syrup).Drinking cherry juice seems to reduce muscle pain in long-distance runners and help insomnia, although whole cherries might work even better. Cranberry juice may help to prevent bladder infections, concord grape juice seems to improve verbal learning skills, orange juice may improve blood flow, and a daily cup of apple juice may not produce any change in cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s patients, but apple juice concentrate may help protect human nerve cells from the neurotoxic Alzheimer’s plaque protein, amyloid Beta.While grape fruit juice may have a high phenolic content compared to other fruit juices, consuming the whole fruit may be better in terms of brain protection. This may be because the majority of polyphenol phytonutrients may be bound to the fiber found in the whole fruit, but removed when juiced. Although, tomato juice may yield more antioxidants than tomatoes.Fruit juice may not just be ineffective, but it could actually be harmful. Drinking apple juice may produce uric acid in the body, and even pureed apples leads to a spike in insulin, but eating heated pureed apples may decrease hunger leading to fewer calories consumed throughout the day. Drinking fruit juice may also lead to enamel erosion, so be sure to rinse with water after consuming fruit juice.	-	fruit,berries,vegetables,fat,sugar,rice,apples,weight loss,bananas,greens,soda,phytonutrients,bread,blood sugar,smoothies	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/21/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/09/what-about-all-the-sugar-in-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/02/the-reason-we-need-more-antioxidants-and-why-were-not-getting-them/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/08/berries-to-prevent-muscle-soreness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/28/how-to-boost-the-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhanced-athletic-recovery-without-undermining-adaptation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safety-of-noni-and-mangosteen-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liquid-calories-do-smoothies-lead-to-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caution-anti-inflammatory-foods-in-the-third-trimester/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-vinegar-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clinical-studies-on-acai-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-morbid-obesity-be-reversed-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-fruit-whose-juice-is-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-smoothies-what-does-the-science-say/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/insulin,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tomato-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/water,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cherries,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Cranberry-juice,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tomatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-fruit-whose-juice-is-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-fructose-corn-syrup,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-smoothies-what-does-the-science-say/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	
T-794	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/frying/	frying	Frying (along with grilling, roasting, and barbequing) beef, pork, poultry, and fish creates heterocyclic amines, which may be carcinogenic. Deep frying foods can also create volatile toxins, which may pose a respiratory risk, and neurotoxins that may be linked to hand tremors. Even just the vapors of frying bacon contain the potent carcinogen nitrosamine.Frying potatoes to make French fries and potato chips (and even frying sweet potatoes) may create acrylamide, which is a known carcinogen. Frying foods also adds a lot of relatively empty calories.	-	cancer,carcinogens,heterocyclic amines,cooking methods,chicken,meat,antioxidants,poultry,oils,breast cancer,DNA damage,women's health,beef,fat,pork	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/29/collaboration-new-vectors-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/24/is-it-better-to-bake-boil-or-steam-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-kept-secret-in-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-carcinogens-in-animal-fat-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-more-nutritious/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/essential-tremor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/	
T-806	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/garbanzo-beans/	garbanzo beans	Garbanzo bean are a legume, also known as chickpeas, Bengal gram, chana, and other names.“Longevity legumes” such as chickpeas have been used in traditional medicine to treat high blood pressure and diabetes. They contain many nutrients, antioxidants, phytochemicals, and phytates. Chickpeas contain five times more the antioxidant content when sprouted.Including chickpeas in one’s diet may reduce risk of the type of prediabetes known as metabolic syndrome. Chickpeas are anti-inflammatory and contain an abundance of non-heme iron—the safest form of iron. Chickpeas, along with other legumes, have been responsible for dropping C-reactive protein levels. Eating beans, chickpeas, split peas, or lentils at least three times a week was associated in one study with 33% less risk of colorectal polyps.	-	chickpeas,beans,heart disease,heart health,legumes,diabetes,lentils,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,split peas,cancer,vegetables,meat,grains,cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slow-beating-heart-beans-vs-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-sprouting-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-beans-theyre-good-for-your-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooked-beans-or-sprouted-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brca-breast-cancer-genes-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-bean-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/canned-beans-or-cooked-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increased-lifespan-from-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/c-reactive-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/chickpeas,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/polyps/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/longevity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/metabolic-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sprouting/

T-840	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gmo/	GMO	The safety of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) remains an open question since few human studies have been conducted.  The greater danger of GMOs may be the pesticides associated with them, particularly since 80% of GMO crops are bioengineered for pesticide resistance alone.One study found an insecticidal GMO crop protein in 93% of blood samples of pregnant women, but the health implications are unclear. The researchers suggested their exposure was linked to contaminated meat.Monsanto’s Roundup Ready soybeans are the number one GMO crop, and they have been found to have significantly higher pesticide residues than conventional, non-GMO and organic soy. The Roundup pesticide, glyphosate, appears to have effects on human tissue at the concentrations one might be exposed to eating GMO crops.But in addition to Roundup’s active ingredient, glyphosate, the pesticide also contains a range of adjuvants and surfactants designed to help the glyphosate penetrate into plant tissues. Roundup sprayed on GMO crops was shown to be toxic, with hormonal effects, at doses even lower than the concentration used in the fields.Toxicity levels for eight out of nine other pesticide cocktails were as much as one thousand times more toxic than their “active ingredients.” Roundup was found to be 100 times more toxic than glyphosate alone, which the manufacturer vigorously denies.	-	organic foods,pesticides,women's health,soybeans,glyphosate,industry influence,Monsanto,Roundup,soy,animal studies,reproductive health,pregnancy,safety limits,farm animals,breast health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/12/gmo-soy-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/07/monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/05/gmos-safe-case-roundup-ready-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/28/gmos-safe-case-bt-corn/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-gmos-safe-the-case-of-roundup-ready-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-gmos-safe-the-case-of-bt-corn/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pesticides,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soybeans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/glyphosate,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Roundup,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Monsanto

Gooseberries may also protect the liver, kidneys, and nerves, and they have demonstrated an apparent anti-invasive effect on cancer cells in vitro, with the distinct advantage of doing less damage to neighboring normal cells than many other cancer-fighting compounds.They are often used in dry powder form, called amla.Gooseberries may be effective for diabetes sufferers in bringing sugar levels down into the normal range. They are high in the phytonutrient pyrogallol, which appears to reduce inflammation while boosting immune and anticancer function. Other Ayurvedic herbal preparations such as triphala are often contaminated with toxic metals, but not so with gooseberry powder. By adding a teaspoon of gooseberry powder to a breakfast smoothie or other recipe, one can get a powerful and inexpensive boost of antioxidants and other nutrients.	-	amla,berries,India,fruit,phytonutrients,dried fruit,antioxidants,oxidative stress,cancer,cloves,blueberries,medications,ranking foods,in vitro studies,Ayurvedic medicine	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ayurvedic-medicine/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/amla/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/triphala/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoothies/	
T-851	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout/	gout	Gout is a painful inflammatory arthritic disease caused by too much uric acid in the blood, causing sharp crystals to develop in the joints.Purines of animal origin, heavy alcohol consumption, and being overweight as a teenager may increase the risk of gout. Fructose, found in both sugar and high fructose corn syrup leads to uric acid production in the body, increasing the risk of gout.Lead contamination may be linked to an increased prevalence. It has been recommended that doctors and nutritionists factor in the risk of lead contamination when advising clients to add bone broth in their diets, which has become more popular with the introduction of the Paleo Diet.Yeast (a natural immune system regulator) is high in purines, so those with gout may want to limit consumption to less than a teaspoon a day.The drug, allopurinol, is commonly prescribed for gout management. Research has also shown the potential to reduce the risk of gout through diet modification, without the use of expensive drug treatments and the risk of their associated side-effects.Higher consumption of purine-rich plant foods like cauliflower, mushrooms, peas, beans, asparagus, and lentils appear to be protective. Contrary to conventional medical advice, eating purine-rich plant foods (see also plant-based diets) have not been associated with high uric acid levels. Cutting out soda beverages may also reduce the risk of gout.In general, individuals eating a more alkaline diet—vegetarian, in this case—were found to flush significantly more uric acid from the body, decreasing the uric acid levels in the blood. In an interventional trial it was found that, in only a few days, participants experienced a 93% decline in the risk of uric acid crystallization.Due to the ability to dramatically decrease uric acid levels, cilantro may also be useful. Cherries fight inflammation and may lower uric acid levels. They show great potential to treat gout by dropping the number of flares, potentially enabling patients to go off medication. C-reactive protein levels dropped in a study where participants ate about 45 cherries a day for a month, with some anti-inflammatory benefit remaining even a month later.	-	uric acid,kidney disease,arthritis,cancer,meat,animal products,side effects,kidney health,inflammation,joint health,beans,purines,vegans,heavy metals,fish	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/03/how-to-prevent-childhood-obesity-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/15/using-cherries-to-treat-gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/06/why-some-like-cilantro-and-others-hate-it/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/12/who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/20/uric-acid-caused-by-meat-and-sugar/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/08/how-to-treat-gout-with-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gout-with-cherry-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gout-treatment-with-a-cherry-on-top/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-prediabetes-in-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/miocene-meteorites-and-uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-cilantro-gene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flesh-and-fructose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/allopurinol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fructose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lentils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/purines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/yeast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/peas/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asparagus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout/C-reactive%20protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alkaline-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cilantro/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cauliflower/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/	
T-852	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains/	grains	A healthy plant-based diet consisting of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts and seeds may help cut chronic disease risk. Nutrition research suggests that, unless you have been diagnosed with celiac disease, you should eat whole grains, including gluten grains, since overall, whole grains are linked to lower chronic disease risk. Unfortunately the standard American diet includes a high proportion of refined grains, which do not provide the equivalent health benefits.The Framingham Heart Study found that three or more daily servings of whole grains were associated with a slimmer waist.  Another study found that the eating of three whole grain portions a day alleviated hypertension as much as medication did. Whole grains may help lower risk for prediabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, cancer in general, and breast and prostate cancer in particular. Whole grains contain beneficial nutrients including magnesium, zinc, ergothioneine and phytates.  By sprouting grains, you can increase the antioxidant content.The toxic metal cadmium can be found in

T-854	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grape-juice/	grape juice	Grape juice has been found to have beneficial health properties, including an apparent decrease in platelet activity—similar to the effects seen with aspirin. This is significant, as platelet activity is implicated in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis.Concord grape juice is part of the category of blue/purple foods (such as berries) that are associated with improving verbal learning, due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Such foods may be helpful in improving cognitive function in older adults with memory decline. When a study compared multiple varieties of juice, purple grape juice was ranked first in terms of the amount of phenolics—phytonutrients that may provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease.Phytonutrients, such as those found in grape juice, may also play a role in increasing thermogenesis (heat generation) and fat oxidation, which both enhance metabolism.If grape juice has these benefits, consider how many more may be gained from eating intact grapes. When measuring the antioxidant capacity of various fruits and juices, the amount present in whole fruit far surpasses that found in juice—including grape juice with added vitamin C.The one thing juice offers that whole fruit does not is excessive sugar: Welch’s grape juice contains more sugar than Coca Cola—at the rate of nine teaspoons per cup.	-	phytonutrients,fruit juice,juice,grapes,fruit,Coca-Cola,vegetables,antioxidants,apple juice,apples,berries,brain disease,orange juice,brain health,soda	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/21/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/03/burning-fat-with-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/02/the-number-one-global-diet-risk/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-aggregation-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-fruit-whose-juice-is-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grapes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/platelets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aspirin/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-c/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cocacola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/	
T-858	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grapes/	grapes	In the U.S., what passes for black currants are usually actually champagne grape raisins, but may still be more nutritious than regular raisins, which come from green grapes. Raisins given as a snack for kids may be so satiating that the children end up eating fewer calories overall.The healthiest grapes are often grown in relatively dry, sun-exposed, relatively infertile soil. Eating whole grapes is probably more nutritious than just drinking grape juice and may significantly lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas fruit juice consumption is associated with a higher risk. Concord grape juice, however, may help slow brain aging, and an evaluation of nine common fruit juices showed purple grape juice to have the most phenols, which may be protective against Alzheimer’s disease. In terms of dental health, we must be careful with both whole fruits, like grapes, and their juices since their natural acids can erode tooth enamel. Grapes have antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and benefit gene expression. Green grapes, though, have a low antioxidant amount. Grapes have polyphenols and flavonoids that may help with weight loss.Grapes along with other fruits and vegetables, may help to decrease TOR enzyme activity, which in turn may lower cancer risk. Certain phytonutrients, including resveratrol in grapes, mimic the potentially beneficial physiological effects of caloric restriction. Consuming grapes may also help protect joint cartilage and reduce inflammation, reduce asthma symptoms, and improve mood. The grape components of de-alcoholized red wine, may improve arterial function, but eating grapes with seeds may be more effective than drinking wine if the goal is to reduce breast cancer risk. Concord grapes in particular may help prevent breast cancer, and red grapes may slow liver cancer cell growth.	-	fruit,vegetables,berries,cancer,inflammation,antioxidants,heart

T-865	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/green-tea/	green tea	Green tea is one of the healthiest beverages we can drink, with antibacterial, antitoxin, antiviral, antifungal, anti-cancer (including breast), UV protectants, and reduced all-cause mortality benefits (although hibiscus tea may actually have more antioxidants). Green tea may also reduce nausea, pain, and stress, boost our resting metabolism, and help prevent nitrate to nitrite conversion. Tea may even positively affect our mind and inhibit the production of TOR. Gargling tea may help prevent the common cold. Drinking coffee is also health-promoting, though green tea is better. But adding cow’s milk or soy milk to tea may compromise some of the beneficial effects. About 10 cups of tea a day is probably the safe upper limit. Drinking too much tea may increase risk of fluorosis in children. Matcha tea (powdered green tea leaves) is likely the healthiest form, but if brewing instead, cold steeping may actually be best.	-	tea,cancer,Japan,antioxidants,men's health,prostate cancer,beverages,vegetables,soy,fruit,black tea,mortality,stroke,EGCG,in vitro studies	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-green-tea-help-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tea-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gorlin-syndrome-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannabis-receptors-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-mgus-and-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pomegranate-vs-placebo-for-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-vs-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-vs-exercise-for-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-green-tea-for-boosting-antiviral-immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-green-tea-help-treat-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-level-dynamics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-the-blues-with-greens-mao-inhibitors-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beauty-is-more-than-skin-deep/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soymilk-suppression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenohormesis-what-doesnt-kill-plants-may-make-us-stronger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-dietary-supplements-may-be-more-than-a-waste-of-money/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-level-dynamics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannabis-receptors-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soymilk-suppression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-beverage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-vs-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/overdosing-on-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-matcha-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/	
T-867	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/greens/	greens	People may have gained health benefits from wild greens as long as 200,000 years ago. Today, greens are considered one of the healthiest vegetables, and they’re inexpensive. Organic greens may be healthier than non-organic greens due to their defensive response to getting bitten by bugs. The calcium in dark green leafy vegetables is more effectively absorbed by the body than that found in cow’s milk. Potassium from greens may be anti-inflammatory and may prevent strokes and heart disease.  Greens can also provide iron and zinc, antioxidants, and magnesium, a nutrient that may lower the risk of a range of health concerns including diabetes, heart disease, and sudden cardiac death.  Green leafy vegetables are the best source of plant-based nitrates. Nitrates from a plant-based diet are not considered harmful. In fact, nitric oxide formed from plant-based nitrate may play a role in the prevention of heart disease and high blood pressure. Eating whole plant foods is likely better for your health than taking supplements.  For example, folate, which can reduce the risk of depression, in greens appears preferable to folic acid supplements. Many nutrients found in greens are fat soluble, which means including some healthy whole food fats like nuts or seeds, in a meal can help you better absorb the phytonutrients.  Plant-based diets, including greens, tend to be alkaline-forming, which may help protect muscle mass and reduce the risk of gout and kidney stones. High consumption in particular of green leafy and cruciferous vegetables may be linked to lower rates of cognitive decline. Greens can be an important part of a plant-based diet that could reduce risk for cardiac disease  and heart attack. Some nutrients are destroyed by cooking, but some nutrients become more absorbable. So, a mix of cooked and raw vegetables, including greens, may be best. Smoothies may also be a great source to get all of the nutrients greens have to offer. Although make sure to drink whole food smoothies (not made from juice), and it may be better to use a straw to prevent enamel erosion.Consuming at least one serving a month of greens appears to reduce the risk of glaucoma by 69%. Lutein and zeaxanthin, nutrients found greens, also appear to be protective against cataracts and macular degeneration. Greens consumption is also associated with increased physical attractiveness, reduced facial wrinkling, improved dental health, better immune system, and may reduce free radical DNA damage.Two or more daily servings of greens may help clear the human papilloma virus, which can cause cancer. Eating green leafy vegetables may also reduce risk for breast cancer, kidney cancer, and lymphoma, and overall cancer risk. Adding mustard powder o cooked greens can boost sulforaphane levels to help protect against cancer.Overall, most people in the U.S. fall short in meeting guidelines set by the USDA.

T-875	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora/	gut flora	Our gut flora consists of trillions of bacteria living in our digestive tract. Its function is so important that it could be considered an organ. Recent studies analyzed the gut flora of people across multiple countries and continents and identified two enterotypes. Enterotypes correlate with our diet and can change as our diet changes. Diets rich in animal protein and saturated fat are associated with the Bacteriodes enterotype, while diets rich in healthy carbohydrates are associated with the Prevotella enterotype.When our gut bacteria process the food we ingest, by-products are created. Examples of potentially harmful by-products created in our gut from a diet rich in animal products include: hydrogen sulfide, which can be produced in the colon through putrefaction of meat and may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease; secondary bile acid, which may increase the risk for certain cancers, and Trimethylamine (TMA), a fishy smelling compound that is a by-product of choline, found in eggs, milk, liver, red meat, poultry, and fish, and may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.  Conversely, a whole-food, plant-based, high-fiber diet can have beneficial effects on our gut bacteria. Such a diet feeds bacteria that produce butyrate. Butyrate can be absorbed by our colon lining and block inflammation. Lignans from plants are converted to human lignans by our gut flora. High concentrations of lignans are associated with lower breast cancer risks. Sulforaphane, a powerful phytonutrient can also be produced by gut flora.Other advantages of having a healthy microbiome are healthy weight and estrogen suppression.	-	microbiome,fiber,meat,plant-based diets,vegetables,fruit,cancer,stroke,animal products,short-chain fatty acids,obesity,heart disease,diabetes,butyrate,heart health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/20/how-to-prevent-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/07/how-probiotics-affect-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/23/how-a-gluten-free-diet-can-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/20/food-additives-that-may-make-our-gut-leaky/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/19/how-eggs-can-impact-body-odor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/28/how-avoiding-chicken-could-prevent-bladder-infections/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/getting-starch-to-take-the-path-of-most-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-become-a-fecal-transplant-super-donor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resistant-starch-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-change-your-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prebiotics-tending-our-inner-garden/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-obesity-infectious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibacterial-toothpaste-harmful-helpful-or-harmless/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-your-gut-microbiome-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-microbiome-strike-it-rich-with-whole-grains/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-more-to-weigh-less/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-most-potent-phytoestrogen-is-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleopoo-what-we-can-learn-from-fossilized-feces/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-five-to-one-fiber-rule/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prebiotics-tending-our-inner-garden/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/choline,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-your-gut-microbiome-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	
T-884	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ham/	ham	Ham is pork that has been preserved either through curing, brining, salting or smoking. A number of studies have demonstrated processed meats such as ham have deleterious effects on our health. For example, the smoking process may instill carcinogens. Also, nitrates and nitrite use in processed meat to lower the risk of botulism may produce nitrosamines, potential carcinogens (see also here). Cured meat consumption may also be associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There may also be a positive association between processed meat intake (such as ham) and weight gain and cellulite formation. Ham and other processed meat consumption may also shorten our telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes.	-	cardiovascular health,mortality,heart health,heart disease,meat,cardiovascular disease,cancer,animal products,hot dogs,processed meat,bacon,plant-based diets,animal fat,turkey,carcinogens	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/26/how-to-protect-our-telomeres-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/24/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/14/does-liquid-smoke-cause-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-palatability-of-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-cancer-does-lunch-meat-cause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-industry-reaction-new-cancer-guidelines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bacon-good-or-is-spinach-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-compared-cigarette-smoking/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/	
T-890	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/harvard/	Harvard	Dr. Walter Willet, the Department of Nutrition Chair at Harvard University has pointed out that plant protein sources are healthier than animal sources. He has also recommended limiting consumption of coconut oil to prevent a rise in bad cholesterol.Earning a high score on the Alternative Eating Index, developed by Harvard faculty members, can lower macular degeneration risk.Like London School and Stanford counterparts, Harvard researchers have found exercise may be as effective as medications in treating heart disease, stroke, and in preventing diabetes. Harvard research has resulted in other key findings such as eating nuts regularly may lower total mortality risk; nut and fiber intake during teen years may reduce subsequent breast cancer risk; consuming eggs may increase the possibility of type 2 diabetes and the spread of prostate cancer; higher saturated fat intake is associated with lower sperm counts; trans fat and higher animal protein intake may increase heart disease risk; consuming more vegetables and fruit as well as peanut butter may be able to do the opposite; aiming for below-average cholesterol levels may provide better heart disease protection; eating whole grains may lower type 2 diabetes risk; eating more animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol may harm the kidneys; red meat intake might raise the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality; a low-carb plant-based diet may also mean a lower mortality risk; daily egg consumption may mean a higher mortality risk; meat and dairy intake may mean a higher cancer risk; the mercury amount considered by the U.S. EPA to be safe should be lower; a public cutback in mercury levels could raise both national I.Q. points and wages; there is an apparent link between adolescent milk intake, especially for skim milk, and teen acne; cured meat consumption may be a risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;   common household chemicals may produce childhood allergic reactions; and finally, buying more plant-based foods may help both a consumer’s health and budget.The Harvard Nurses Health Study (HNHS) is considered a key long-term population study on women’s health. Its findings include eating meat or eggs before pregnancy may raise gestational diabetes risk; regular nut and fiber consumption, along with limiting dietary cholesterol, may helpextend a woman’s life

T-891	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/harvard-nurses-health-study/	Harvard Nurses' Health Study	The Harvard Nurses Health Study (HNHS), started in 1976, is considered to be a key long-term population study on women’s health.The studies have identified important health risk factors including: persistent organic pollutants consumed through contaminated food may be linked to diabetes; eating meat or eggs before pregnancy may raise gestational diabetes risk; taking in less than a single alcoholic drink per day may still raise the risk of breast cancer; daily consumption of the amount of cholesterol found in one egg may shorten a woman’s lifespan as much as limited smoking; meat intake may be an infertility risk factor; there’s a positive association between teen milk intake, especially skim milk, and teen acne; and nut consumption does not lead to expected weight gain.Study findings have also suggested specific steps women can take to improve their health including: nut and grapefruit consumption may help prevent breast cancer; getting enough Vitamin E may reduce asthma risk; eating berries, along with cruciferous and green leafy vegetables may reduce cognitive decline; sufficient magnesium intake may help prevent heart attacks; getting enough plant-based omega-3’s may reduce depression; and, eating more plant protein and reducing refined carbohydrate intake may reduce heart disease risk.	-	plant-based diets,fruit,vegetables,women's health,vegans,vegetarians,mortality,cancer,antioxidants,animal fat,breast cancer,inflammation,meat,oxidative stress,fat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/21/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/11/salmon-may-be-the-greatest-source-of-dietary-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/20/food-additives-that-may-make-our-gut-leaky/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/12/how-grapefruit-affects-prescription-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-crohns-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-fine-kettle-of-fluoxetine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-alcohol-what-much-is-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/multivitamin-supplements-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-parts-of-the-mediterranean-diet-extended-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/national-dairy-council-on-acne-and-milk/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cognition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/national-dairy-council-on-acne-and-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nut,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/acne,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-e/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-fine-kettle-of-fluoxetine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-alcohol-what-much-is-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-gain/

T-904	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/	heart disease	Heart disease is the #1 killer in the United States, and elevated cholesterol levels are thought to be a primary cause. This may explain why a plant-based diet, which is free of cholesterol and saturated animal fats, has been so successful in preventing and treating the disease. The balance of evidence suggests that a plant-based diet may not only protect against but even reverse heart disease.Reversing heart disease is critical, considering heart disease often starts in childhood. Heart disease was found to be almost non-existent in populations eating a diet centered on whole plant foods. The arteries of those eating a plant-based diet have less atherosclerotic plaque than runners or those on a low-carb diet.Plant foods are the only source of heart-healthy fiber, while animal products are the only significant source of cholesterol.Unfortunately, due to a lack of nutrition education in medical schools, many doctors may be unaware of the power of nutrition to stop heart disease and improve heart health. The most common treatment for heart disease is the prescription of cholesterol-lowering drugs that may be linked to increased breast cancer risk, among other adverse side effects.Eating just one egg a day may exceed the safe limit of cholesterol and has been linked to a shortened lifespan. Eggs are so high in cholesterol that the egg industry cannot even legally claim that eggs are “nutritious.”Meat and heme iron found in animal products may increase heart disease mortality, and fish and fish oil supplements may not be as heart-healthy as once thought, due to contamination by mercury and industrial pollutants. Chicken and fish consumption may have the same negative impact as red meat on cholesterol. Dairy may increase heart disease risk because dairy products are the #1 source of saturated fat in the American diet, a fact the dairy industry has tried to hide through misleading advertising campaigns.There are certain plant foods that may be protective against heart disease, especially foods high in nitrates, antioxidants, fiber and potassium. These include greens such as kale, soy and other beans, nuts (including peanut butter), tea (especially hibiscus and green tea), flax seeds, whole grains, red rice, citrus, Ceylon cinnamon, coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate, dried apples, Indian gooseberries, golden raisins and currants, berries, tomatoes, oatmeal and some spices (such as turmeric). For additional benefits, combine a plant-based diet with one hour of exercise daily and seven hours of sleep each night.Certain foods, drugs and lifestyle habits are associated with adverse cardiac consequences including coconut oil and coconut milk, dark fish, Premarin, salt, high fat meals, BPA and smoking. Alcohol may be protective against heart disease but is not recommended because it increases cancer risk.	-	heart health,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,cancer,smoking,meat,cholesterol,mortality,lifestyle medicine,stroke,women's health,vegetarians,chronic diseases,vegans,plant-based diets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/23/the-five-most-important-dietary-tweaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/31/why-is-milk-consumption-associated-with-more-bone-fractures/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/14/how-much-fiber-should-you-eat-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/03/whats-the-mediterranean-diets-secret/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-green-tea-help-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-bpa-hasnt-been-banned/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-and-the-eskimo-fish-tale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-all-children-have-their-cholesterol-checked/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-diet-soda-increase-stroke-risk-as-much-as-regular-soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-smoking-in-the-50s-is-like-eating-today/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/physicians-may-be-missing-their-most-important-tool/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spin-doctors-how-the-media-reports-on-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-eating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-poultry-viruses-in-human-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-cholesterol-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-actual-benefit-of-diet-vs-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-carb-diets-and-coronary-blood-flow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxygenating-blood-with-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-on-receipts-getting-under-our-skin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/would-taxing-unhealthy-foods-improve-public-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-for-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fully-consensual-heart-disease-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-low-risk-means-high-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sesame-seeds-for-knee-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifestyle-medicine,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/potassium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nitrates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industrial-pollutants/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber

These include greens such as kale, soy and other beans, nuts (including peanut butter), tea (especially hibiscus and green tea), flax seeds, whole grains, red rice, citrus, Ceylon cinnamon, coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate, dried apples, Indian gooseberries, golden raisins and currants, berries, tomatoes, oatmeal and some spices (such as turmeric). For additional benefits, combine a plant-based diet with one hour of exercise daily and seven hours of sleep each night.Certain foods, drugs and lifestyle habits are associated with adverse cardiac consequences including coconut oil and coconut milk, dark fish, Premarin, salt, high fat meals, BPA and smoking. Alcohol may be protective against heart disease but is not recommended because it increases cancer risk.	-	cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,cancer,smoking,meat,cholesterol,mortality,lifestyle medicine,stroke,women's health,vegetarians,chronic diseases,vegans,plant-based diets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/06/do-you-meet-the-simple-seven/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/08/how-well-do-cholesterol-lowering-drugs-actually-work/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/01/flax-seeds-can-have-profound-effect-on-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/25/how-turmeric-can-help-combat-the-effects-of-sitting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/14/how-much-fiber-should-you-eat-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/04/how-to-design-saturated-fat-studies-to-hide-the-truth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/28/white-meat-may-be-as-cholesterol-raising-as-red/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/09/benefits-of-oatmeal-for-fatty-liver-disease/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-green-tea-help-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-bpa-hasnt-been-banned/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-and-the-eskimo-fish-tale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-all-children-have-their-cholesterol-checked/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-diet-soda-increase-stroke-risk-as-much-as-regular-soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-smoking-in-the-50s-is-like-eating-today/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/physicians-may-be-missing-their-most-important-tool/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spin-doctors-how-the-media-reports-on-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-eating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-poultry-viruses-in-human-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-cholesterol-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-actual-benefit-of-diet-vs-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-carb-diets-and-coronary-blood-flow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxygenating-blood-with-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-on-receipts-getting-under-our-skin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/would-taxing-unhealthy-foods-improve-public-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-for-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fully-consensual-heart-disease-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-low-risk-means-high-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sesame-seeds-for-knee-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-treatment-for-angina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifestyle-medicine,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/potassium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nitrates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industrial-pollutants/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber	
T-910	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heavy-metals/	heavy metals	Heavy metal exposure (the toxins, not the music!) can have detrimental effects on our health. Mercury can affect brain development, cadmium and lead appear to lower male fertility, copper may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s, and all may be associated with a higher risk of cancer.The heavy metals present in our food supply often exceed safe limits (see also here). Some metals are hard to avoid due to their presence in cigarettes, meats (see also here, here, here and here), seafood, some brands of nutritional yeast, supplements (see also here, here, here and here) and even whole grains and vegetables. There is also aluminum found in tea, but the phytonutrients also present prevent it from being easily absorbed. Hibiscus tea does have a high amount of manganese though, and so we should limit our intake to no more than two quarts a day. Research indicates that the bioavailability of heavy metals may be lower in plant-derived foods than in animal-derived foods, despite the fact that plant foods sometimes contain higher amounts. This is likely the reason why vegetarians had lower levels of cadmium, lead and mercury even though their heavy metal intake was higher than meat-eaters (and switching to a plant-based diet lowers levels within months). Organic produce may have less cadmium than conventional produce.	-	lead,fish,vegetables,supplements,cancer,carcinogens,fruit,phytonutrients,cholesterol,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,antioxidants,cardiovascular health,heart health,pesticides	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/17/aluminum-levels-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/30/why-pregnant-women-should-avoid-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/15/how-to-reduce-your-dietary-cadmium-absorption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/12/who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/04/how-seafood-can-impact-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/10/food-dyes-and-adhd/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/filled-full-of-lead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-associated-with-brain-shrinkage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-meat-a-risk-factor-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangers-of-dietary-supplement-deregulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/creatine-brain-fuel-supplementation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-canned-fruit-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-meat-a-risk-factor-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/filled-full-of-lead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-vs-omega-3s-for-brain-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/creatine-brain-fuel-supplementation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/	
T-916	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hemorrhoids/	hemorrhoids	The size and consistency of one’s bowel movement may affect and predict a host of health issues, including hemorrhoids as pressure backs up blood flow into the veins around the anus. Abdominal pressure caused by overexertion in the bathroom can also push part of the stomach up above the diaphragm, known as hiatal hernia. It may cause herniations in the wall of the colon itself (diverticulosis), or it can push blood flow back into the legs, resulting in varicose veins. These issues are rare in rural African populations eating traditional plant-based diets (such as beans and corn) who pass a bulky stool two or three times a day. White South Africans and black and white Americans not only have more than 50 times the heart disease (the #1 killer of Americans), 10 times more colon cancer, and more than 50 times more gallstones and appendicitis (the #1 cause of emergency abdominal surgery), but also more than 25 times the rates of so-called “pressure diseases,” including hemorrhoids.Frequency of bowel movements also plays a part in one’s health. Being vegetarian, especially vegan, is strongly associated with a higher frequency of bowel movements. Vegetarians also have a lower prevalence of allergies, coronary artery disease, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, diverticulosis, and diseases overall.The fiber in whole plant foods is about more than just reducing the risk for the #1 and #2 killers of Americans—cardiovascular disease and cancer. Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal complaint in the United States, leading to millions of doctor visits every year. More than just the discomfort, constipation can increase risk for hiatal hernia, varicose veins, and hemorrhoids.Chamomile is a powerful anti-inflammatory medicinal plant which may be beneficial in treating hemorrhoids, as well as other diseases.	-	vegetarians,plant-based diets,diverticulosis,vegans,cancer,diverticulitis,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,heart health,standard American diet,varicose veins,diabetes,fiber,Africa,colon health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/11/we-can-end-the-heart-disease-epidemic/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/putrefying-protein-and-toxifying-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-movement-frequency/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lose-two-pounds-one-sitting-taking-mioscenic-route/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-hiatal-hernia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-you-sit-squat-or-lean-during-a-bowel-movement/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/allergies,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/varicose-veins,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chamomile-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/corn,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hiatal-hernia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Africa,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diverticulosis

T-921	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/herbal-tea/	herbal tea	Herbal teas, such as hibiscus tea, may contain antioxidant nutrients (see also here, here, here, and here). Drinking herbal tea may be associated with reduced blood pressure, protection against radiation damage, alleviated stress levels, and anti-inflammatory benefits. Endurance athletes can especially benefit from lemon verbena tea, which unlike antioxidant supplements, does not appear to interfere with the body’s adaptive hermetic response to exercise. Peppermint tea may also improve athletic performance and help nausea and irritable bowel syndromeHerbal tea might also be a better alternative for children who may otherwise be at risk for dental fluorosis by consuming regular tea. However, fruity and sour teas may still cause dental erosions (see also here). This complication can be avoided by using a straw or by rinsing your mouth out with water after drinking.You may want to consider limiting your intake of certain types of tea. For instance, hibiscus tea should not be consumed in excess due to the possible absorption of potentially harmful levels of manganese and aluminum. Yerba maté tea has been found to cause an increase in cell death and may have the capacity to cause cancer, so you may want to avoid it altogether. Men or women with high estrogen levels should be wary of nettle tea due to its high estrogen content. Lastly, pregnant women should be especially careful drinking chamomile tea so as to avoid possibly serious fetal complications.	-	tea,water,hibiscus tea,vegetables,junk food,side effects,citrus,green tea,exercise,peppermint,mint,kidney failure,safety limits,processed foods,black tea	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/17/aluminum-levels-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/06/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/10/plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/08/hibiscus-tea-flower-power/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/14/does-liquid-smoke-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/28/how-to-boost-the-benefits-of-exercise/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-herbal-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-yerba-mate-tea-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhanced-athletic-recovery-without-undermining-adaptation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-hibiscus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hibiscus-tea-vs-plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/natural-treatments-morning-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-oil-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-aromatherapy-for-nausea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-hibiscus-tea-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhancing-athletic-performance-with-peppermint/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-yerba-mate/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-herbal-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-yerba-mate-tea-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-hibiscus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hibiscus-tea-vs-plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-oil-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhancing-athletic-performance-with-peppermint/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-yerba-mate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-aromatherapy-for-nausea/	
T-923	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/herbs/	herbs	Some of the earliest populations have called upon the medicinal benefits of herbs to treat a variety of ailments. Herbs have some of the highest antioxidants levels. Just a dash of herbs has the power to reduce inflammation and may even protect against DNA damage (see also here). Combining herbs can increase their benefits by boosting the bioavailability of some of the compounds they contain.Hydroponic basil may be richer in antioxidants than soil-grown basil due to the higher amount of stress the plant is placed under. Pregnant women should be wary of feverfew and black cohosh, which was surprisingly recommended at health food stores. When it comes to herbs, however, it is best to stay away from retail supplement suppliers as their claims as recommendations, and ingredients are often unreliable and may be dangerous. In the case of Ayurvedic medicine, it may even be contaminated with lead and other heavy metals.	-	spices,cancer,inflammation,medications,women's health,heart disease,heart health,cardiovascular health,antioxidants,alternative medicine,turmeric,cardiovascular disease,DNA damage,vegetables,tea	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/20/the-top-four-anti-inflammatory-spices/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/04/inflammation-diet-and-vitamin-s/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/05/why-pepper-boosts-turmeric-blood-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/22/the-top-three-dna-protecting-spices/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangerous-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-antioxidant-superstars-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppermint-oil-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-hydroponic-basil-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-acne-barberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-its-all-greek-to-the-usda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-tarragon/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-hydroponic-basil-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangerous-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/	
T-929	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heterocyclic-amines/	heterocyclic amines	Heterocyclic amines are potentially carcinogenic chemical compounds formed in cooked muscle tissue. Examples of heterocyclic amines include harmane, which may cause essential tremor (see also here), and PhIP, considered an estrogenic carcinogen that may increase breast cancer risk. Poultry meat (see also here and here) appears to have the highest concentration of heterocyclic amines, but muscles are not the only source of these toxins. These carcinogens may be present in eggs, cheese, creatine supplements and cigarette smoke. There are some things those who eat meat can do to reduce the risk of developing cancer. Boiling appears to be the safest cooking method in terms of carcinogen levels. Other foods may help too. For example, cruciferous vegetables have been shown to reduce the absorption of heterocyclic amines for as long as two weeks after consumption. White and green tea may also be protective. Participate in Meatless Monday and our levels of PhIP and MelQx will drop to zero in just twenty-four hours. Veggie meat is a safe bet since it contains no muscle tissue. Even deep fried they contain no heterocyclic amines.	-	cancer,meat,poultry,turkey,carcinogens,chicken,fish,breast cancer,women's health,pork,animal products,DNA damage,cooking methods,beef,prostate cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/13/is-titanium-dioxide-in-food-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/21/why-the-egg-cancer-link/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/19/why-are-eggs-linked-to-cancer-progression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/18/broccoli-boosts-liver-detox-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/31/treating-pancreatic-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/18/why-do-vegan-women-have-fewer-female-cancers/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-vs-veggie-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heterocyclic-amines-in-eggs-cheese-and-creatine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-choline-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phip-the-three-strikes-breast-carcinogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/presidents-cancer-panel-report-on-environmental-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-more-nutritious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-vs-veggie-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heterocyclic-amines-in-eggs-cheese-and-creatine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-choline-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phip-the-three-strikes-breast-carcinogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/	
T-932	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hibiscus-tea/	hibiscus tea	Ideally, we should flood our bloodstream with antioxidants at every meal, and sip green tea or hibiscus tea all day long. Why hibiscus tea? Because a study of 282 beverages revealed that hibiscus tea ranked highest in antioxidant content ̶ higher than even green tea or matcha.Each time we eat, free radicals are produced as our bodies absorb food. So it’s best to consume generous amounts of antioxidant fruits and vegetables throughout the day to counteract the negative effects of oxidative cellular stress.High blood pressure kills millions of people. Hibiscus tea has been found to be potentially as effective as a leading blood pressure drug. The daily consumption of hibiscus tea may significantly lower blood pressure by boosting nitric oxide production, which could help arteries relax and dilate better.While hibiscus tea may confer some desirable health benefits, excess consumption may come with its own side effects. Aluminum in the diet has been associated with the development of brain diseases like Alzheimer’s. If you’re drinking lots of tea, are you absorbing high amounts of aluminum? Black, green, white and oolong teas don’t significantly contribute to aluminum absorption; research suggests that the bioavailability of aluminum in tea—how much our bodies actually absorb—is low. Hibiscus tea may be different because it contains natural acids, like citric acid. (Some hibiscus teas are as acidic as orange juice or colas.) While there’s insufficient data showing whether hibiscus tea acids boost absorption of its aluminum, or whether the high amounts of manganese found in hibiscus pose a problem, we suggest no more than about one quart of hibiscus tea a day for healthy adults (and less for kids or pregnant women). Acidic beverages can erode the enamel on your teeth. For this reason, smoothies or teas are best consumed using a straw. Wait at least an hour before brushing your teeth, but do rinse your mouth out with water after drinking to wash away some of the acids.	-	tea,herbal tea,antioxidants,green tea,fruit,phytonutrients,vegetables,World Health Organization,water,beverages,cholesterol,berries,standard American diet,smoking,sugar	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/17/aluminum-levels-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/10/plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/07/treating-pms-with-saffron/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-there-too-much-aluminum-in-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-hibiscus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hibiscus-tea-vs-plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clinical-studies-on-acai-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-hibiscus-tea-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aluminum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beverages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tea,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/orange-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nitric-oxide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/green-tea	
T-935	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-blood-pressure/	high blood pressure	Blood pressure is considered a key vital sign. High blood pressure may be the #1 killer risk factor in the world, as it is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (see also here), heart attacks, and possibly Alzheimer’s disease.High blood pressure is a serious risk factor like high cholesterol. Meat and sugar increase uric acid levels, which are associated with an increased risk for high blood pressure. Attempting to reduce high blood pressure with medications may not be as effective as lifestyle approaches, as they do not treat the cause. Even those on blood pressure lowering drugs can get a further 78% drop in risk by eating and living healthfully. Salt intake (see also here) and industrial fructose (added sugars), may also be associated with high blood pressure.On the other hand, fructose from up to 20 servings a day of whole fruit does not appear to raise blood pressure. Overall, a predominately plant-based diet appears to reduce high blood pressure risk (see also here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here) possibly due to the high fiber, potassium, and nitrate content of plant foods. Dr. Walter Kempner was able to reduce high blood pressure with a diet consisting of basically white rice and fruit (see also here). Specific foods or drinks that may help reduce high blood pressure include beans (see also here), whole grains, other legumes, beets, beet juice, cocoa, flaxseeds, greens, hibiscus tea (see also here), purple potatoes, and the seaweed, wakame.	-	blood pressure,hypertension,plant-based diets,meat,heart disease,heart health,cholesterol,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular

T-936	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-fructose-corn-syrup/	high fructose corn syrup	High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is an industrial sugar used to sweeten many processed foods and beverages.  It is made from corn starch and is relatively inexpensive to manufacture.  Most HFCS is composed of approximately 55% glucose and 45% fructose, while table sugar (sucrose) is 50% glucose and 50% fructose. The levels of all sugars consumed per person in the U.S. has increased from 4 pounds a year in 1776 to 20 pounds in 1850, to 120 pounds in 1994, and now 160 pounds per person per year.  Much of this increase in sugar consumption is from HFCS, especially in the form of soft drinks.Intake of meat and sugar including HFCS, is associated with an increased concentration of blood uric acid levels. Increased levels of blood uric acid may be associated with increased risk of gout, high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease.Increased consumption of all sugars, including HFCS, has been implicated in the recent increase of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While glucose is immediately used for energy in every cell of the body, fructose, like alcohol, is metabolized by the liver and turned into fat.A recent study of 5,000 10th graders has shown high consumption of HFCS-containing soft drink beverages (soda) may be tied to hyperactivity.In a recent study of 50 different brands of foods containing HFCS, 30% of all the foods contained measurable levels of the heavy metal mercury, a known neurotoxin and cardiac toxin, while 60% of the dairy products in the study contained mercury.Studies have shown that the natural sugar fructose in fruit is metabolized in the body differently than the fructose in HFCS.  The absorption of natural fructose in fruit is slowed down and buffered by the fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients contained in the fruit. As such, the spike in blood sugar, the corresponding rise in blood insulin levels, and then subsequent rebound dip into hypoglycemia observed after consumption of HFCS is not observed in the consumption of fruit.  In fact, studies have shown that even daily consumption of 20 servings of fruit a day does not negatively impact blood sugar levels.The American Heart Association (AHA) in its most recent recommendation has advocated lowering the consumption of all added sugars to no more than 100 calories a day for women and 150 calories a day for men.  The World Health Organization now recommends no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar a day.	-	sugar,blood sugar,soda,fructose,fruit,diabetes,meat,sweeteners,antioxidants,weight loss,high blood pressure,liver disease,calories,phytonutrients,chronic diseases	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/23/can-you-eat-too-much-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/27/mercury-testing-recommended-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/09/what-about-all-the-sugar-in-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/12/anti-cancer-nutrient-synergy-in-cranberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/19/much-added-sugar-much/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-diet-soda-increase-stroke-risk-as-much-as-regular-soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sugar-vs-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-hyperactivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flesh-and-fructose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-type-of-protein-is-better-for-our-kidneys/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fructose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-sugar/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soda,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/glucose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hyperactivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/insulin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar/	
T-953	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones/	hormones	The consumption of animal products may cause an increase of the hormone, IGF-1, which may increase both cancer risk and progression. Animal protein in particular may boost our IGF-1 production compared to plant proteins. The recent dramatic increase of hormone-dependent cancers in Japan has been speculatively linked to the steroids present in meat. Hormone replacement therapy (including bio-identical hormones) has been shown to be associated with increased risk of heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and invasive breast cancer.Hormones in meat may affect a woman’s fertility; eating a single serving of meat per day may increase infertility risk by 30%. Cooked meat contains PhIP, a heterocyclic amine that activates estrogen receptors almost as strongly as pure estrogen. Nettle tea and lavender may also have estrogenic effects. Early onset puberty in girls may be partly due to xenoestrogens (industrial pollutants often found in meat and fish) and the hormones found in animal protein and milk. In contrast, eating soy may be associated with starting puberty 7-8 months later than girls who eat little or no soy. Mushrooms may also help prevent breast cancer by blocking estrogen production, thus decreasing the tumor’s ability to grow. All animal products contain estrogen. This may explain why, in a study of over a thousand women eating plant-based diets, vegan women had one-fifth the number of twins compared with vegetarians and omnivores.Milk intake may be linked to increased prostate cancer risk and lower sperm counts in men. Endocrine-disrupting industrial toxins in the aquatic food chain may affect genital development of boysand sexual function in men. High rates of acne among milk drinkers may be associated with the high hormone levels in milk.Steroid hormones, either naturally occurring or via synthetics (estrogen implants, animal feed, etc.), are unavoidable in food of animal origin. Trace amounts of hormones may be common in the environment and have been found in the water supply.One way to decrease levels of steroid hormones in the body may be to avoid eggs, dairy, and meat. People on plant-based diets have lower levels of IGF-1, which does not seem to affect their ability to accumulate muscle mass. Those on plant-based diets also have lower levels of adiponectin, a hormone that may contribute to cellulite. Those eating more plants hold onto more DHEA, an important hormone associated with increased longevity. A study confirmed that vegetarian women have lower levels of estradiol and therefore presumably a lower breast cancer risk due to higher fiber intake, which helps the body eliminate excess estrogen. Sex-hormone-binding globulins, which remove excess hormones from our bodies, have been found at higher levels in those eating vegetarian diets. Certain plant foods high in the hormone melatonin may help with insomnia.	-	cancer,obesity,diabetes,women's health,heart health,plant-based diets,weight gain,prediabetes,breast cancer,cardiovascular

T-970	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension/	hypertension	High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, may be the #1 risk factor for death in the world, as it is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, heart attacks, kidney disease, stroke, blindness and possibly Alzheimer’s disease. Nearly one in three adults suffers from high blood pressure, and by the time Americans reach 60, nearly half have high blood pressure.Meat and sugar increase uric acid levels, which are associated with an increased risk for high blood pressure. Salt intake and industrially-manufactured fructose (added sugars) may also be linked to high blood pressure. Interestingly, the fructose found in up to 20 servings of whole fruit daily does not appear to raise blood pressure.In one study of rural Kenyans, the traditional diet of whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafy vegetables resulted in not a single case of arteriosclerosis among 1,800 individuals.Among rural Chinese residents who adhered to a traditional plant-based diet, blood pressures of 110 over 70 were the norm for teenagers as well as seniors in their 70s, defying the oft-held belief that blood pressures rise as a result of normal aging.The largest ever study of diet and blood pressure risk involving 89,000 Californians found a drop in blood pressure, along with diabetes and obesity rates, that correlated with volume of plant foods consumed. Simply removing meat from the diet can lower blood pressure in just seven days, without medication.Attempting to reduce high blood pressure with medications may not be as effective as lifestyle approaches, as medications do not treat the underlying cause. Even those already on blood pressure-lowering drugs can gain a further 78% drop in risk by eating and living healthfully.In the 1940s, Dr. Walter Kempner at Duke University was able to reduce his patients’ high blood pressure with a low-salt, low-protein diet consisting of white rice and fruit. The doctor successfully treated over 18,000 individuals using this all but forgotten intervention that was equal to or more effective than modern high blood pressure drugs. Despite his success, many physicians today fail to prescribe dietary changes to lower high blood pressure among their patients.Sadly, while there are now hundreds of blood pressure drugs on the market, high blood pressure remains the #1 cause of death and disability in the world, killing nine million people a year.A range of research into specific foods or beverages that may help reduce high blood pressure includes beans and other legumes, whole grains, beets, beet juice, cocoa, flaxseeds, greens, hibiscus tea, purple potatoes and the seaweed wakame.	-	blood pressure,high blood pressure,plant-based diets,meat,heart disease,vegetarians,cardiovascular health,vegans,heart health,cardiovascular disease,fruit,vegetables,cholesterol,diabetes,animal products	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/13/whats-the-optimal-cholesterol-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/08/eat-protect-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/09/what-about-all-the-sugar-in-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/01/flax-seeds-can-have-profound-effect-on-hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/16/introducing-the-kempner-rice-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-to-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-diet-may-affect-stress-responses-in-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diet-studies-show-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vit-d-supplements-help-diabetes-weight-loss-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-strengthen-the-mind-body-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-brain-food-older-adults/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-dha-supplements-to-boost-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-chronic-kidney-disease-with-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caramel-coloring-carcinogens-coke-pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reductionism-deficiency-mentality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-miso-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/curing-painful-diabetic-neuropathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taking-personal-responsibility-for-your-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sodium-and-arterial-function-a-salting-our-endothelium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/flaxseeds,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-walter-kempner/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/hibiscus-tea,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/salt,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/sugar,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/beets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/whole-grains,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-blood-pressure

Once our dopamine response is dulled, similar to when substance abusers must use more drugs to get the same high, we may overeat to achieve the degree of satisfaction experienced previously.	-	animal products,cheese,dairy,meat,fat,chicken,junk food,milk,industry influence,trans fats,saturated fat,cake,hamburgers,calories,poultry	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/29/butter-is-back/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/12/how-to-get-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/28/how-fatty-foods-may-affect-our-love-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/10/food-dyes-and-adhd/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-paratuberculosis-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-usda-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apthous-ulcer-mystery-solved/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-fatty-foods-addictive/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/type-1-diabetes,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol	
T-980	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/igf-1/	IGF-1	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a natural human growth hormone that assists the body’s transition from childhood into healthy adulthood. Once the body completes this natural growth period, high levels of IGF-1 are no longer necessary and over-production may become detrimental to health. Uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation (which may be the result of too much IGF-1) may lead to cancer growth. Having low levels of IGF-1 as an adult may improve the chances of acancer-free life.Animal protein consumption appears toincrease IGF-1 levels. Plant protein consumption in general may not have the same effect.Dairy products and excess soy may also result in similar IGF-1 results. A plant-based diet and a regular exercise routine may reduce our IGF-1 levels in less than two weeks. Lowered IGF-1 levels don’t appear to have any effect on muscular strength.	-	plant-based diets,meat,vegans,vegetarians,dairy,women's health,cancer,cardiovascular health,diabetes,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,breast cancer,animal protein,animal products,protein	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/02/estrogens-in-cooked-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/21/plant-based-diets-for-multiple-sclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/15/why-are-children-starting-puberty-earlier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/19/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/14/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/18/why-do-vegan-women-have-fewer-female-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/25/how-a-tick-bite-can-lead-to-food-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/23/role-caffeine-artery-function/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alpha-gal-and-the-lone-star-tick/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-hormonal-interference/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/curing-painful-diabetic-neuropathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clonal-deletion-theory-of-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-compared-cigarette-smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-meat-a-risk-factor-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-protein-recommendations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animalistic-plant-proteins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-bodybuilding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-proofing-mutation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-bodybuilding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-proofing-mutation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/

Chronic diseases associated with inflammation such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and arthritis may be prevented or even possibly reversed by a plant-based diet, whereas chicken and eggs may play a pro-inflammatory role. Avoiding meat during pregnancy may prevent childhood allergies and parasitic brain infections.	-	diabetes,children,autoimmune diseases,protein,dairy,type 1 diabetes,milk,vitamin D supplements,supplements,chronic diseases,prediabetes,women's health,respiratory infections,stress,high blood pressure	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/23/how-a-gluten-free-diet-can-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/16/should-we-take-chlorella-to-boost-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/27/the-spice-that-helps-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/25/how-a-tick-bite-can-lead-to-food-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-diet-for-depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/striking-root-turmeric-curcumin-ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vit-d-supplements-help-diabetes-weight-loss-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-plant-based-diets-help-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/using-the-produce-aisle-to-boost-immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-green-tea-for-boosting-antiviral-immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-paratuberculosis-in-meat-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-casein-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/laughter-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/halving-heart-attack-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-hepatitis-c-with-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prebiotics-tending-our-inner-garden/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kale-and-the-immune-system/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-obesity-infectious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-c-supplements-for-terminal-cancer-patients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/smoking-versus-kale-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preserving-athlete-immunity-with-chlorella-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gluten-free-diets-separating-the-wheat-from-the-chat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-happier-people-actually-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-a-neutropenic-diet-necessary-for-cancer-patients/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/zinc-gel-for-colds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/airborne%C2%AE-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/sleep-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cocoa-good-chocolate-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/halving-heart-attack-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/apthous-ulcer-mystery-solved/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/halving-heart-attack-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kale-and-the-immune-system/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/diet-lichen-planus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2011/10/04/inflammation-diet-and-vitamin-s/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/smoking-versus-kale-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/red-tea-honeybush-chamomile-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-gluten/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/	
T-983	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/impotence/	impotence	75% of men with narrowed arteries due to cholesterol have some form of erectile dysfunction and a lower quality of life. Popular diets, namely the Atkins diet, may actually increase your risk of developing sexual dysfunction. A plant-based diet, however, may help diseased arteries, benefiting not only blood flow to your heart, but all your vital organs.Nitric oxide is an enzyme essential for blood vessel dilation in all arteries–including those arteries in the pelvic region. Drugs specifically targeting erectile dysfunction increase nitric oxide production in vessels, but not without potentialside-effects. Two foods may be particularly effective in reducing or possibly even eliminating erectile dysfunction. Watermelon and pistachio nuts may improve erectile function. Certain plastics chemicals may impair function though.	-	erectile dysfunction,meat,plant-based diets,men's health,vegetables,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,sexual dysfunction,fruit,women's health,vegans,cancer,heart disease,heart health,animal products	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/22/foods-for-a-long-life-and-love-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/20/pills-vs-diet-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/27/pistachios-may-help-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/25/do-vegans-get-more-cavities/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-medicine-or-evidence-biased/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-power-of-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saving-lives-by-treating-acne-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/rosy-glow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-mans-diet-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-plastic-and-male-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-medicine-or-evidence-biased/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-power-of-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-plastic-and-male-sexual-dysfunction/	
T-984	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/in-vitro-studies/	in vitro studies	There are countless in vitro studies that attest to the healing power of plants: The blood of women on a plant based diet for two weeks was dripped on cancer cells; this reduced the cancer growth rate by 20%. Cells exposed to carcinogens had broccoli dripped on them; this helped prevent their DNA from being mutated. Broccoli juice, when dripped on cancer stem cells, was found to inhibit breast cancer stem cells. In a petri dish, broccoli prevents lung cancer cells from spreading. Smoker’s DNA in a test tube was exposed to a known DNA damaging chemical; those who were eating broccoli suffered significantly less damage. Chamomile, when dripped on various human cancer cells, slowed down their growth. Black beans have shown potent inhibitory activity against colon and breast cancer cells. Adding an extract of organic strawberries blocked colon and breast cancer growth by almost 75%. Apple peels have shown potent anti-proliferative effects on human cancer cells. A layer of human fat cells was placed in a petri dish; as soy phytonutrients were added, fat uptake was almost completely blocked. Specific vegetables have been found to halt tumor cell growth of specific cancers; thus, to protect ourselves against many types of cancers, it is important to eat a varied diet. When blood is dripped on prostate cancer cells in a petri dish, the standard group reduced growth by about 10%, those on a plant-based diet knocked the growth down 70%. Indian gooseberries have been found to kill cancer cells but leave normal cells alone (see also here, here). And when kale was dripped on white blood cells, it boosted their ability to produce antibodies. Other interesting in vitro studies: When measuring the beneficial effects of tea on arterial cells, soymilk as well as cow’s milk appeared to block the benefits of the tea. To test new Alzheimer’s treatments, you put human nerve cells and amyloid beta (which is the neurotoxic Alzheimer’s protein) and add a substance to see if it saves the nerve cells from death. Apple juice has been found to be effective. And when Dragon’s blood was dropped on human cartilage in a petri dish, cartilage breakdown was reduced. The standard ORAC test to determine the antioxidant power of various substances measures how good the substance is at altering a chemical oxidation reaction in a test tube. Red rice has been found to have ten times more antioxidants than brown rice.	-	cancer,Pritikin,women's health,plant-based diets,vegetarians,prostate cancer,vegans,standard American diet,men's health,mortality,exercise,cell death,breast disease,breast cancer,antioxidants	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-rice-vs-black-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-green-tea-help-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pinto-beans-vs-black-beans-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soymilk-suppression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kale-and-the-immune-system/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-slimming-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-acne-barberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sesame-seeds-for-knee-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-fighting-berries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-tea-honeybush-chamomile-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-a-plant-based-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pinto-beans-vs-black-beans-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-rice-vs-black-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soymilk-suppression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kale-and-the-immune-system/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-slimming-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-fighting-berries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-up-on-the-veggies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-tea-honeybush-chamomile-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/	
T-986	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/india/	India	India’s population has low rates of Alzheimer’s, cancer, childhood allergies, and asthma—as well as highly frequent bowel movements—why are they so much healthier? It may be because a larger portion of the population consumes a plant-based diet.The Indian gooseberry, or amla, is among the most antioxidant-rich food on Earth. These berries have been shown to decrease cholesterol, inflammation, and cancer cell growth in vitro. Indian gooseberries were shown to decrease breast cancer cell spread in a laboratory model of metastasis as much as a chemotherapy drug.Just one Indian gooseberry a day may decrease cholesterol in as little as three weeks, while two a day may decrease blood sugar in diabetics as much as some of the leading medications.Another staple in the Indian culture is turmeric, a spice featured in curry. Curcumin is the pigment within turmeric that gives it its yellow color. Smokers taking curcumin supplements appear able to decrease the level of carcinogens in their body.	-	curcumin,spices,turmeric,inflammation,animal products,vegetables,cancer,meat,vegans,vegetarians,curry powder,Alzheimer’s disease,brain disease,dementia,Japan	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/22/preventing-and-treating-colon-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/08/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/12/who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/05/why-pepper-boosts-turmeric-blood-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/12/might-turmeric-help-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/12/where-are-the-lowest-rates-of-alzheimers-in-the-world/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-inflammatory-orbital-pseudotumor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-and-triphala-tested-for-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-paratuberculosis-in-meat-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-to-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/speeding-recovery-from-surgery-with-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogen-blocking-effects-of-turmeric/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogen-blocking-effects-of-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/	
T-990	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industrial-pollutants/	industrial pollutants	Increasing exposure to environmental toxins, including those in food, appear to be linked to higher cancer risk and diabetes risk. Children’s pollutant levels may exceed the safety level by a greater margin than the level for adults.On average, pregnant women have 35 measured chemicals in their bodies including DDT and flame retardant chemicals, and it may be particularly bad in the US. These toxins can be passed on to the baby through breastfeeding. Women may want to consider not eating fish for up to one year before becoming pregnant due to their high level of pollutants.Industrial toxins build up in animal fat, and feeding meat and bone meal to farm animals may also result in the biomagnification of industrial pollutants. Meat, dairy, eggs, fish, and fish oil (including children’s fish oil supplements) seem to be the primary source of flame retardant chemicals in the U.S. diet. Animal products, especially fish, seem to be the top human exposure source for endocrine-disrupting pollutants called alkylphenols, which may be linked to allergies and can also be found in meat, dairy, and eggs. Animal products are a top source of other toxins such as perfluorochemicals as well.Xenoestrogens, industrial chemicals with estrogenic effects, have been associated with early onset puberty in girls and lowered sperm counts in males. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in fish may also impair male genital development and result in lower testosterone levels.Farmed fish, particularly salmon, have been found to have the highest levels of DDT, PCBs, and dioxins (compared to wild caught fish). Dioxins were found in 96% of catfish samples collected in the U.S. Tuna has been found to be especially high in mercury, which may be linked to increased rates of depression and suicide. The neurotoxin, BMAA, concentrates in seafood and may be linked to Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS).The pollutants in the aquatic food chain may explain the link between fish consumption and diabetes risk. Thus, pollution-free sources such as microalgae based DHA may be a better option than fish to get long chain omega-3s. The best way to detoxify the body of industrial toxins may be to not “tox” in the first place by choosing a plant-based diet as vegans may have the lowest levels of pollutants in their bloodstream. A plant-based diet can also help prevent contamination and help detox after contamination, which may take years. Certain plant foods, like canned Chinese bamboo shoots, and high fructose corn syrup may be contaminated with mercury. Other items to be cautious of include scented household products, certain Ayurvedic herbal supplements, (which may be contaminated with lead and mercury), creatine supplements, and protein powder supplements.  Among genetically modified crops, so far, Bt corn seems to be safe. Eating organic foods may reduce our risk of exposure to pesticides and heavy metals such as cadmium.	-	fish,children,meat,weight loss,pregnancy,seafood,women's health,fat,animal

T-991	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence/	industry influence	Much of what we eat is influenced not only by what restaurants and grocery stores offer, but also by associations that represent various food industries. Well-funded associations can influence legislation, regulations, dietary guidelines, nutritional research, and public messaging.The sugar, salt, egg, poultry, beef, pork, fish, juice, dairy, and snack food industries have been accused of downplaying the risks of their products, while the nutritional supplements industry has frequently been charged with exaggerating its marketing claims.Industry associations often underwrite research studies, sometimes producing a “funding effect,” the skewing of results favorable to research funders. Examples include a study showing that jelly beans may help boost sports performance, another demonstrating that kiwifruit may help treat insomnia, and another boosting water’s effectiveness for mental concentration. Partnering with different community groups, some food industries have promoted the message that inactivity, rather than calorie-rich foods, is the main cause of obesity. Sometimes industry-funded studies produce results consistent with non-industry-funded research, as with the chocolate, blueberry, and nut industries. Agribusiness has successfully influenced government guidelines on what to eat. In contrast to Greece, where the national health and welfare agency makes public dietary recommendations, in the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) makes the recommendations. Critics say the USDA’s mandate to promote agribusiness can conflict with its responsibility to provide public diet advice.  Reportedly, the 2010 USDA Guidelines Committee had less corporate influence than previous groups, resulting in plant-based foods being emphasized more than ever before.Meat industry influence may be a reason why antibiotics continue to be used as livestock feed, bacteria standards are less stringent than they could be, and questionable approaches like viruses as a food additive receive serious consideration. Across a number of food types, industry influence has helped keep possibly harmful additives legal, such as trans fats, caramel color, and phosphates. Pesticide regulations, such as those related to Roundup, appear to be based more on economic rather than scientific factors.The pharmaceutical industry has sometimes questioned the effectiveness of certain plant-based foods as treatment for specific medical conditions. Research funding to explore what plant nutrition can do is likely low at least in part because plants, unless genetically modified, can’t be patented. Traditionally, the pharmaceutical industry has focused on developing drugs with very specific actions rather than overall health promotion.Proposed California legislation supporting nutrition education for doctors was weakened by apparent medical profession influence. The balance of evidence supporting a plant based diet is often rejected by doctors in the face of prevailing conventional wisdom. The fast food industry promotes a positive image with doctors and patients by locating their restaurants in hospitals and donating to hospital causes.	-	heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular

T-992	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/infant-formula/	infant formula	While the current recommendation based on the best available science is that all babies should be breast fed for at least six months.Though babies are exposed to toxins and environmental pollutants excreted from the mother’s body into breast milk, such as PCBs and pesticides, epidemiological studies indicate any negative effects of these compounds are outweighed by protective effects conferred by other components of mother’s milk. Breast fed babies have a lower risk of obesity, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, asthma, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and childhood cancers, are more likely to consume a variety of fruits and vegetables after weaning, and are less likely to undergo premature puberty. Mechanistic connections between all these correlations have not been fully elucidated, but may be related to the high levels of protein and growth factors found in cow’s milk compared to human milk, leading to excess weight gain and growth in children. Interestingly, exclusive breast feeding does not fully eliminate exposure to cow’s milk proteins when the maternal diet contains dairy products; these proteins may be absorbed and excreted intact into breast milk and may be linked to colic symptoms in infants.Mothers wishing to minimize toxin excretion in their breast milk may be able to decrease their exposure by avoiding animal foods, which, due to bioaccumulation, can be more highly contaminated than plant foods. Long term plant-based diets, however, may lead to decreased maternal DHA levels, an unsaturated fatty acid important for brain development. The neural development of children of strictly plant-based breast-feeding or pregnant women may be supported by maternal supplementation with 200 mg/day DHA. These supplements should be algae based, as this eliminates the associated risk of contamination with pesticides, toxins or heavy metals found with fish consumption or fish-oil based supplements. Excessive DHA supplementation (800 mg/day) should also be avoided during pregnancy and lactation, as this may also have negative effects on neural development in babies. Breast-feeding mothers consuming fenugreek seed should be aware that this may cause a maple-syrup-like smell to infant sweat, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of a serious congenital disease, branched-chain ketoaciduria, a condition which also makes the infant smell sweet.Should one be unable to personally breast feed, feeding infants with human milk from another source show identical health benefits. Allowing the baby to be fed by a wet nurse or purchasing human milk from a milk bank are two possible alternatives for procuring human milk during the crucial first six months. If these options are also not viable and formula must be utilized, some in vitro evidence suggests avoiding formulas containing carrageenan may help protect babies from inflammatory bowel diseases, leaky gut syndrome and, consequently, autoimmune diseases later in life.	-	breastfeeding,infants,breast milk,women's health,dairy,pregnancy,milk,protein,PCBs,persistent organic pollutants,mercury,omega-3 fatty acids,autoimmune diseases,cheese,DHA	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/16/how-milk-may-contribute-to-childhood-obesity/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-paratuberculosis-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-infant-colic-by-changing-moms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegan-women-supplement-with-dha-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/side-effect-of-fenugreek-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthy-food-movement-strength-in-unity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/formula-for-childhood-obesity/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heavy-metals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/infants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carrageenan/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bioaccumulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fenugreek/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/autoimmune-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/premature-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industrial-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lactation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/growth-promoters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leaky-gut-theory/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/celiac-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colic/	
T-993	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/infants/	infants	Accumulated pollutants from food consumed by pregnant mothers can be passed on through the placenta or breast. Pollutants found in animal fat may increase the risk of having babies with smaller brains, cognitive impairment, and respiratory infections. Pregnant mothers eating chicken and eggs containing phthalate can lead to baby boys having a smaller penis. Expectant mothers eating hot dogs increases childhood cancer risk, and higher meat intake may be linked to childhood eczema. Babies delivered by cesarean section may be at an increased risk for allergies.Eating meat or eggs before pregnancy can raise the risk of gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Even a pregnant woman inhaling meat cooking fumes can jeopardize fetal development, and cooked meat carcinogens can be passed on through a woman’s breast milk. Fish consumption during pregnancy can result in babies with brain damage. Salmon, cod, anchovies, and mackeral may have alkylphenols, which are endocrine-disrupting pollutants that can be passed through breast milk. Mothers-to-be should consider not eating fish at least a year before pregnancy and during the pregnancy itself to reduce the chances of passing on pollutants to their child to prevent brain damage. Staying away from chamomile tea during pregnancy will reduce fetal risks. Pregnant mothers should also avoid eating spirulina to reduce seizure risk to their babies.While pregnant vegan mothers are likely to have a lower level of pollutants that could be passed on to their infants, pregnant and breast feeding vegan mothers should be sure they’re getting enough vitamin B-12 to reduce the risk of B-12 deficiency in their infants which can be life-threatening. Pregnant vegans should also make sure to get enough iodine.Mothers given non-fish DHA supplements had children with higher IQs. The healthiest food for infants is breastmilk. Infants under 3 months of age should not eat vegetables. Also, giving cow’s milk to babies may have adverse long-term health effects on the infants including increased risk of childhood obesity. In some babies, cow’s milk has been linked to sudden infant death syndrome. The casomorphin in cow’s milk has been speculatively linked to autism, type I diabetes, and other disorders. Parents should also note the food additive carrageenan has been pulled from infant formula in Europe, but is allowed in U.S. formula.Infants placed in the basket of a shopping cart with raw meat are at an increased risk for food poisoning. Homeopathic remedies can be harmful when used in excess in infants. Many Ayurvedic medicines have been found to be contaminated with lead, which has resulted in infant brain damage. Mothers must be careful not to give their infants solutions made with too many poppy seeds. Pediatric CT scans can raise cancer risk.

T-994	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/infertility/	infertility	Meat intake is associated with infertility. Eating a single serving of any meat per day has been associated with a 30 percent greater risk of interference with ovulation. Red meat increases infertility risk 40 percent; however, eating one serving of chicken a day (half a chicken breast) may increase women’s infertility risk more than 50 percent—worse than bacon and hot dogs. Replacing animal sources of protein with vegetable sources of protein—like beans—may reduce infertility risk that is due to failure to ovulate. Pregnant women may want to stay away from all meat because it is so packed with sex steroid hormones that eating meat could affect the development of their sons’ genitals while in the womb, with the possibility of adversely affecting their sons’ future fertility. Animal protein intake increases the levels of a growth hormone called IGF-1, which has been linked not only to infertility but to cancer.Soft drinks have been associated with infertility in women, though this may be from an indirect route, with soda linked to obesity and obesity linked to reduced fertilization rates.About one in a dozen women suffer from endometriosis, which accounts for about half of the cases of infertility, but soy food consumption may reduce the risk of endometriosis.Infertility affects 10 to 15 percent of couples attempting to conceive, and in about half the cases, a problem is found in the man. Increasing saturated fat intake just 5 percent was associated with a 38 percent lower sperm count, and the higher the saturated fat intake, the lower the sperm count—up to a 65 percent reduction in total sperm count. But male fertility is not just about sperm count, but about how well the sperm work. Manmade endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants that build up in animal fat, particularly fish, may be partially responsible for a decline in semen quality. High dietary intake of saturated fat–laden foods like meat products and milk may negatively affect semen quality in humans, while some fruits and vegetables may maintain or improve semen quality because of their antioxidants and nutrient content.	-	men's health,reproductive health,obesity,fertility,dairy,sperm counts,cancer,sexual health,hormones,milk,women's health,breast cancer,fish,saturated fat,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/04/male-fertility-and-dietary-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/16/dietary-estrogens-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/14/role-diet-declining-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/11/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/11/exploiting-autophagy-to-live-longer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-bpa-hasnt-been-banned/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-we-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-diet-in-declining-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-hormones-male-infertility/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endometriosis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soda,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fertility,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sperm-counts,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy	
T-995	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/	inflammation	Inflammation may play a role in a number of diseases, including asthma, premature aging, mental health issues, periodontal disease, obesity, skin aging, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cancer, arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Brain inflammation from arachidonic acid found in animal products may explain why those eating plant-based diets have less stress, anxiety and depression, and better moods.Oxidized LDL cholesterol may trigger the inflammatory response in artery walls which can eventually lead to a heart attack. Coronary artery disease and erectile dysfunction are two manifestations of inflamed and clogged arteries.Animal products, including eggs, dairy, meat, and animal protein in general may increase inflammation. A single meal of meat, eggs, or dairy may cause a spike of inflammation within hours that can stiffen one’s arteries. Several factors may account for this, such as heme iron, endotoxins, saturated fat, a high bacteria load, TMAO, tapeworms, advanced glycation end products or AGEs, and NeuGc, a foreign meat molecule that may increase the risk of heart disease and cancer.There are non-animal products that also cause inflammation. For example, excessive exposure to plastics with BPA may be linked with liver inflammation; acrylamide, which can be formed from deep-fried carbohydrate-rich foods; large doses of vitamin supplements; titanium dioxide; and carrageenan.Dr. Dean Ornish has written that healthy living and eating habits, which include eating a primarily whole-foods, plant-based diet, can downregulate genes that promote inflammation. Whole plant foods tend to be anti-inflammatory. This may explain higher blood protein levels in vegans. This is possibly due to the fiber, dietary magnesium, and phytates present in many plant foods.Though important to eat a variety of whole plant foods, fruits and vegetables with the highest antioxidant levels seem to reduce inflammation the most. Other specific plant foods identified as being anti-inflammatory include apples; black pepper; broccoli; broccoli sprouts; Ceylon cinnamon; cilantro; citrus fruits; ginger; cloves; rosemary; chamomile; dragon’s blood; dried apples and dried plums; berries; crimini, oyster, maitake, and white button mushrooms; nutritional yeast,  flaxseed oil or flaxseed; green leafy vegetables; turmeric, which may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, treat knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and reduce post-surgical pain; tomato juice, legumes, purple potatoes, nuts in general, and specifically English walnuts, which may be so effective that the equivalent of eating a single walnut half per day may cut the risk of dying from inflammatory disease in about half. Eating a plant-based diet may be as anti-inflammatory as taking aspirin (without the side effects), and sweet Bing cherries and watermelon specifically may be good NSAID alternatives. Fish oil, possibly due to the presence of industrial pollutants, has not been shown to reduce inflammation.From 28 weeks until birth, pregnant women may want to avoid large amounts of anti-inflammatory foods as these may harm the baby in the same way can anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin.	-	heart disease,cardiovascular health,heart health,cardiovascular disease,plant-based

T-996	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/	inflammatory bowel disease	Inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, is an autoimmune condition wherein the immune system attacks the intestines. It is typically debilitating, chronic, and relapsing-remitting—meaning there is no cure. Sufferers are often put on prescription drugs, and may have to get segments of their intestines surgically removed.Studies suggest that inflammatory bowel disease may start at a very early age. Babies fed formula, rather than breastfed, may have a higher risk of developing the disease. A diet high in animal protein seems to increase the risks, as well. This could be attributed to a variety of reasons: blood components in meat that degrade into carbon monoxide, carcinogens created by cooking muscle or consuming processed meat, pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid and iron, huge amounts of bacteria causing inflammation, or even the antibiotics in meat adversely affecting gut flora.An animal-based diet may trigger IBD by causing microbial enzyme activity in the intestines, which produces a harmful gas called hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide can interfere with the body’s utilization of fiber, and damage DNA. Fiber is used by our good bacteria to produce butyrate, a beneficial compound that can reverse the adverse effect of sulfide. Fiber helps maintain the intestinal barrier function, and decrease inflammation in the colon. One study showed women who consume high amounts of fiber have a 40% reduced risk of IBD. The standard American diet may have five or six times more sulfur than a diet centered around unprocessed plant foods. Also, sufferers in remission have a higher risk of relapse with consumption of meat and alcohol, both rich sources of sulfur. Sulfur-containing amino acids are also found in dairy and eggs, and even dried fruit contains sulfur dioxide. Choosing organic products helps eliminate the intake of sulfur. Cabbage family vegetables naturally have some sulfur compounds, but they are not associated with elevated colitis risk.Processed foods contain ingredients that may facilitate the invasion of bacteria. The main ones are polysorbate 80 (found commonly in ice cream, Crisco, Cool Whip, condiments, and cottage cheese); titanium dioxide (a whitening/brightening pigment); maltodextrin (found in Splenda, snack foods, salad dressings, and fiber supplements); and sucralose, which has been shown to increase IBD rates up to 12-fold. The good news is that after stopping consumption, the original balance of gut bacteria may be restored within weeks.Studies have shown that drinking wheatgrass juice, or ingesting curcumin and oat bran, appear effective and safe to decrease symptoms of disease activity and prevent relapse. Also, eliminating dairy may help roughly one in five sufferers. Certain soluble plant fibers may also inhibit Crohn’s-associated invasive bacteria. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage are essential for sustaining intestinal health. But, the best therapy is a whole food plant-based diet, which has afforded the best prevention of relapse, or even obtaining the disease in the first place.	-	ulcerative colitis,microbiome,gut flora,inflammation,colon disease,colon health,butyrate,fiber,short-chain fatty acids,chronic diseases,intestinal health,hydrogen sulfide,meat,standard American diet,plant-based diets	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/20/how-to-prevent-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/10/how-plants-can-be-both-safer-and-more-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/20/the-top-four-anti-inflammatory-spices/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/13/is-titanium-dioxide-in-food-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/07/our-immune-system-uses-plants-to-activate-gut-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/20/food-additives-that-may-make-our-gut-leaky/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/04/inflammation-diet-and-vitamin-s/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-change-your-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-crohns-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/striking-root-turmeric-curcumin-ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prebiotics-tending-our-inner-garden/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/microbiome-the-inside-story/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wheatgrass-juice-ulcerative-colitis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/standard-american-diet,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/tumeric,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/autoimmune-diseases,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-foods,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/intestinal-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hydrogen-sulfide,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/butyrate,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber	
T-1002	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/insomnia/	insomnia	Approximately one in three adults suffers from insomnia. Studies have indicated that seven to eight hours of sleep per night is associated with a longer lifespan, better short-term memory, and better immune function for adults.Insomnia has also been associated with PMS, fibromyalgia, and as a side effect of aspartame ingestion.Melatonin is secreted at night by the pineal gland, and helps regulate circadian rhythm. The production of melatonin decreases as people age, which may be one reason for a higher rate of insomnia among the elderly.Physical exercise has been found to help decrease insomnia. In cases where insomnia is thought to be due to other conditions, treating the underlying condition can then lead to improvements in sleep.In one study where subjects had eaten two kiwis an hour before bed, every night, for four weeks, subjects demonstrated significantly better onset, duration, and efficiency of their sleep. Tart cherries have been associated with improved sleep, as well as almonds, raspberries, goji berries, tomatoes and fenugreek seeds, which have all been found to contain natural levels of melatonin.Chamomile tea is commonly used as a sleep aid, but pregnant women should avoid using it during pregnancy, due to the tea’s anti-inflammatory properties, which can lead to fetal complications. 	-	mental health,depression,sleep,complementary medicine,inflammation,alternative medicine,brain health,headaches,pain,side effects,muscle health,mood,fatigue,medications,serotonin	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/01/two-kiwi-fruits-an-hour-before-bedtime/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/01/side-effects-of-aspartame-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/03/foods-with-natural-melatonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/26/are-sugar-pills-better-than-antidepressant-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/06/which-are-more-anti-inflammatory-sweet-cherries-or-tart-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/10/coffee-caveats/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-and-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-antidepressant-drugs-really-work/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-life-is-a-bowl-of-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aspartame/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/melatonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kiwifruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sleep/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chamomile-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tart-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fibromyalgia/	
T-1004	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/insulin/	insulin	Insulin is one of a number of hormones that regulate how the body uses sugar, fat, and amino acids (building blocks of protein).When blood sugar rises after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin into the blood, which moves sugar (glucose) out of the blood and into the cells of the body, including converting glucose to fat, among other things. The blood sugar then drops to normal levels. Sometimes it overshoots, causing symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Insulin deficiency leads to high blood sugar.In diabetes mellitus, there is a relative insulin deficiency. It is treated with medications like insulin, oral hypoglycemics, or both.  So when blood sugar rises after a meal in a patient with diabetes, it may not drop back down to normal levels–either because the pancreas cannot make enough (Type I); or the body’s cells are so resistant to the existing insulin that they can’t remove the glucose from the bloodstream (Type II). Insulin resistance also usually exists in Type I. Prediabetes is a state of borderline diabetes that may progress to diabetes. Diabetes is a strong risk factor for high cholesterol, vision problems (retinal damage), and cardiovascular health.  We now know that animal (not plant) fat, like that found in meat, can increase insulin resistance shortly after ingestion and for hours later, causing blood sugar to rise more than it would have in the absence of animal fat.There is evidence that diabetes can be prevented, and in many cases of Type II diabetes (and some adult-onset Type I) can be resolved, with plant-based diets.  Weight loss itself, independent of plant-based eating, also helps.Dairy has growth hormones in it, that cause our bodies to secrete additional insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which may stimulate cell growth and have some insulin effect also. In adolescence, a period of rapid growth, it is normal that IGF levels are among the highest in one’s life.  But after we are fully grown, high IGF is abnormal, and may promote growth of tumor cells or cancer cells.  	-	diabetes,prediabetes,dairy,meat,protein,milk,plant-based diets,women's health,vegetarians,vegans,heart health,heart disease,inflammation,eggs,type 1 diabetes	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/01/improving-employee-diets-could-save-companies-millions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/23/can-you-eat-too-much-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/09/what-about-all-the-sugar-in-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/22/how-a-low-carb-diet-is-metabolically-like-being-obese/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/05/how-to-treat-prediabetes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/24/reduce-saturated-fat-intake-to-protect-your-pancreas/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-paratuberculosis-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-lupus-with-turmeric-good-as-gold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-meat-a-risk-factor-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diet-studies-show-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-as-a-disease-of-fat-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diabetic-retinopathy-be-reversed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-reversal-is-it-the-calories-or-the-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-drugs-diets-dont-lower-diabetes-deaths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-for-prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/curing-painful-diabetic-neuropathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-insulin-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-become-a-fecal-transplant-super-donor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-vinegar-help-with-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-casein-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-smoothies-what-does-the-science-say/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/medications,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/IGF-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-sugar,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vision,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prediabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-loss,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat	
T-1012	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iodine/	iodine	Pregnant vegans, are at risk for iodine deficiency. Ensuring enough iodine intake is important particularly if a person consumes a high amount of raw cruciferous vegetables, as this may block the thyroid’s absorption of iodine.Sea vegetables such as nori, dulse, and alaria are excellent sources of iodine. Besides supplying iodine, the seaweed nori may reduce breast cancer risk, while wakame may help those with high blood pressure.Excessive intake of kelp (kombu), paddleweed, or thyroid-containing sausages, however, may lead to iodine toxicity (getting too much iodine). The seaweek hiziki, also known as hijki, is not recommended because it may contain arsenic. Another way to reduce the risk of overloading the thyroid with iodine is by not gargling with iodine solutions like betadine.	-	thyroid health,thyroid disease,sea vegetables,salt,Japan,plant-based diets,seaweed,kelp,dulse,fruit,supplements,women's health,hijiki,milk,sodium	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/05/do-eden-beans-have-too-much-iodine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/08/the-best-way-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/08/how-much-pus-is-there-in-milk/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iodine-supplements-before-during-and-after-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-iodine-can-be-as-bad-as-too-little/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/too-much-iodine-can-be-as-bad-as-too-little/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/	
T-1018	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iron/	iron	Since the human body has no mechanism to excrete excess iron, it is probably best to refrain from consuming blood-based (heme) iron and taking iron supplements unless prescribed (for example, for pregnant women who are demonstrably anemic). This is because iron pills have been linked to birth complications such as preterm birth and maternal hypertension. Presumably because of iron’s pro-oxidant qualities, it can be a double-edged sword; lowering the iron level of cancer patients has been associated with dropping death rates. The absorption of plant-based (non-heme) iron can be regulated by the body, though, making dark green leafy veggies and legumes such as lentils preferable sources, especially since food is a package deal.	-	heart disease,cardiovascular disease,cancer,fiber,cholesterol,cardiovascular health,mortality,heart health,diabetes,heme iron,vegetables,plant-based diets,seeds,nuts,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/05/latest-science-on-rooibos-nettle-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/21/colon-cancer-prevention-is-it-the-fiber-or-the-phytates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/09/the-healthiest-diet-for-weight-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/14/what-do-meat-purge-and-cola-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/19/how-eggs-can-impact-body-odor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/25/are-canned-beans-as-healthy-as-home-cooked/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/03/whats-the-mediterranean-diets-secret/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/12/where-are-the-lowest-rates-of-alzheimers-in-the-world/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-to-reduce-stroke-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/canned-beans-or-cooked-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fennel-seeds-for-menstrual-cramps-and-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veg-table-dietary-nitrate-scoring-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/microbiome-the-inside-story/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-was-heart-disease-rare-in-the-mediterranean/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrient-dense-approach-to-weight-management/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-lentil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/iron-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/plant-vs-cow-calcium-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/chicken-vs-veggie-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-iron-pills-good-for-you/

T-1026	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/japan/	Japan	Those eating a traditional Japanese diet, one low in animal and refined foods and high in legumes such as soy, seem to have lower rates of chronic disease and a longer lifespan. Consumption of soy (but not too much), green tea, mushrooms, and seaweed may explain the reduced breast cancer risk for Japanese women compared to women eating a standard American diet. Japan also has eight times less obesity than the United States.But, the shift from a traditional, more plant-based diet to a more Westernized diet may be linked to several rising Japanese public health concerns such as the dramatic increase in Crohn’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, allergic diseases, sensitive skin, prostate cancer, and mortality rates from breast and prostate cancer. African American males still suffer from advanced prostate cancer at 30 times greater the rate than Japanese men.There is also the issue of industrial pollutants in Japan. For example, after Fukushima, a nuclear accident in 2011, levels of radioactive elements went up in both tuna and shrimp. Endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants have been found to contaminate chicken and fish in the Japanese food supply just as in the United States. But, the level of fire retardant chemicals in the breast tissue of women in Japan is 50 times lower than that of women in California and 100 times lower than of women in New York.A lot of academic research comes from Japan. For example, in the 1990s, Japanese researchers first raised the question if stevia intake could be harmful, and the low-calorie sweetener known as erythritol was first available in Japan. Japanese research also included studies that showed oral intake of tomato extract may help improve sneezing symptoms, adding more than a tablespoon of red pepper powder to a high-fat meal could help boost the fat burned after the meal, it may be possible to halt glaucoma progression with black currants, gargling with water may prevent the common cold, just one egg per day may increase arachidonic acid levels in women, and a high intake of vegetables, fruit, mushrooms, and soy products appears associated with a reduced risk of depression. 	-	cancer,soy,tea,breast

In addition to possible inflammatory effects, meat contains high concentrations of uric acid that can end up as crystals in the joint space in a very painful condition called gout.The anti-inflammatory compounds in sesame seeds may reduce knee pain in sufferers of osteoarthritis, who lose joint cartilage possibly due to inflammation.A plant-based diet and the spice turmeric may alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, which is the progressive destruction of the joints by the body’s own immune system.Studies have shown that cherry juice may be useful in reducing gout flare-ups.	-	arthritis,joint disease,inflammation,pain,heart health,heart disease,meat,osteoarthritis,complementary medicine,alternative medicine,rheumatoid arthritis,gout,uric acid,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/15/using-cherries-to-treat-gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/06/why-some-like-cilantro-and-others-hate-it/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/27/the-spice-that-helps-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/08/how-to-treat-gout-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/02/the-number-one-global-diet-risk/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gout-with-cherry-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gout-treatment-with-a-cherry-on-top/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dragons-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-osteoarthritis-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-plant-based-diets-help-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-cilantro-gene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-aggregation-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sesame-seeds-for-knee-osteoarthritis/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pain,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/osteoarthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/joint-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rheumatoid-arthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout	
T-1037	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/juice/	juice	Overall, blending and consuming whole fruit can help provide more phytonutrients than drinking just the juice. While whole fruit consumption has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, greater fruit juice intake has been linked with a higher risk. Similarly, oranges seem associated with lower glaucoma risk, but orange juice is not, and apples may reduce heart attack risk, while apple juice may increase it. With apples specifically, the primary nutrition is in the peel rather than the juice. And, in terms of potential uric acid production, apple juice likely is worse than sugar water. Tomato juice is a unique case where the processed juice is considered healthier than eating the tomato itself.Juice advertising claims may not always be truthful. For example, almost 75% of manufacturers who claimed to offer 100% pomegranate juice did not. Safety may be another concern when consuming juice. Levels of the mycotoxin patulin in non-organic apple juice often exceeded World Health Organization safety guidelines. Also, bottled pasteurized carrot juice has been found to have benzene levels exceeding safety standards, acute toxicity has been associated with noni juice, and it’s possible to get liver toxicity if we drink about three and a half cups of broccoli juice daily for a month. There may be healthier beverages to drink. In terms of antioxidants, tea has more than cranberry juice, orange juice, or tomato juice; juice may not be as hydrating as water; and fruit juice may erode tooth enamel. The fructose naturally found in fruit and fruit juice does not, however, seem to have the same adverse effects as sugar and high fructose corn syrup. In terms of potential benefits, fruit juice can be a source of phytonutrients and antioxidants, may lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and increase blood flow. Cranberry juice may help prevent bladder infections, and cherry juice may help reduce muscle soreness, prevent gout flares, and improve sleep. The sulforaphane from broccoli sprout juice may target breast cancer cells. Kale juice intake may help lower bad cholesterol and boost good cholesterol, and beet juice can help provide nitric oxide that may help with both athletic performance and blood pressure.	-	fruit

T-1039	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/junk-food/	junk food	High calorie, low nutrient junk foods are a major contributing factor to why the Western diet rates so poorly. The intake of junk food should be as low as possible. In the U.S. dietary guidelines, the U.S. government has not directly stated this, likely due to food industry influence. In 2005, the meat, egg, dairy, and junk food industries may have influenced the government in their food recommendation graphic to give less visual importance to whole, plant foods.Industry influence may also be a factor as the world’s large association of nutritional professionals, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Academy of Family Physicians receive sponsorship dollars from meat, dairy, processed, and junk food companies each year. With the obesity epidemic, a key policy issue is whether food companies should be regulated to sell less junk. In the meantime, most people agree that overall, the public needs to limit its intake of junk food and animal fat, and eat more fruits and vegetables. The American Heart Association recommends the equivalent of a maximum of only two meals per week with meat, dairy, or junk food, with all other meals consisting of unprocessed plant foods. Those eating a Paleo diet agree that junk food intake should be greatly reduced. Avoiding processed junk food is almost universally recommended. Only when foods are ranked by cost per calorie is junk foodcheaper than fruits and vegetables.When people regularly eat calorie dense animal and junk foods, they may blunt their pleasure centers so much that they overeat to compensate. When children are given the choice to eat as much as they want of raisins, grapes, chips, or cookies, children choose to eat less fruit and more junk food.  Artificial sweeteners, which can be in junk foods, often maintain cravings for sweet foods. Plate and cup color may also affect the amount junk food eaten.Unlike whole plant foods, junk food has little or no fiber and generally lack the thousands of phytonutrients available in fruits and vegetables. Too much junk food may contribute to excess intake of phosphorus and trans fats, considered harmful to health.Junk food intake appears to raise the risk for high blood pressure, acne, and obesity. Junk food can raise LDL cholesterol, increase the severity of diabetes, and raise the risk of diseased arteries. Luckily, if we abstain from eating heavily fried and salted foods, our taste buds can change relatively quickly.	-	processed foods,mortality,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular

T-1041	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale/	kale	Kale is a dark leafy green, cruciferous vegetable, and an excellent choice for one of our nine a day servings of fruits and vegetables. Kale is a good source of antioxidants, calcium, nitrates, skin-enhancing carotenoids and other phytonutrients such as lutein and zeaxanthin, which may be protective against glaucoma. Unfortunately, kale is not common in the American diet.Kale like other cruciferous vegetables may boost mood, lower cholesterol, prevent DNA damage, improve immune function, prevent cancer (like breast and kidney cancer) increase cancer survival rates, and reduce the risk of chronic age-related diseases.Kale is one of the more effective bile acid-binding vegetables, which may play a role in lowering the risk of premature degenerative diseases. To avoid interfering with thyroid function, a person must be careful not to eat too much raw kale.

KFC advertises it as having “zero grams of trans fat.” While KFC’s chicken may be free of trans fat, it is not short on saturated fat, which may be associated with decreased rates of survival in those diagnosed with breast cancer. A list put out by the National Cancer Institute rates chicken as number five on the top sources of saturated fat. Also, studies have shown that switching from beef to chicken and fish may not lead to lower cholesterol.Furthermore, when meats are grilled or fried, heterocyclic amines are formed, which may be carcinogenic. Chicken may also contain the potentially carcinogenic chemical called PBDE and arachidonic acid, a compound associated with inflammation and implicated in diseases such as cancer, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders.Okinawa, which has been studied due to the longevity of its residents and their lower rates of diseases such as heart disease and cancer, now is home to at least 12 KFC locations—and over time has witnessed decreases in its average lifespan. Average diets there also now contain three times the saturated fat and sodium compared to prior, more traditional Okinawan diets.	-	cholesterol,saturated fat,eggs,chicken,mortality,beef,animal products,plant-based diets,women's health,poultry,dairy,fast food,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,heart health	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-food-using-the-tobacco-industry-playbook/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-cholesterol-in-the-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chickens-fate-is-sealed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-safe/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asthma,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rheumatoid-arthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sodium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifespan,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/autoimmune-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?fwp_search=PBDE,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heterocyclic-amines,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beef,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/national-cancer-institute/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/trans-fats,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/okinawan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease

T-1051	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-disease/	kidney disease	Kidney disease ranks as the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. What may be some foods to avoid in order to keep our kidneys healthy? Due to toxic metal contamination, NeuG5c, alpha-gal, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), meat (including poultry and processed meat), sugar, and high-fat meals should be avoided to maintain kidney health. Similarly, intake of betel nuts or star fruit can potentially shut down the kidneys, and the safety of chamomile tea for those with kidney disease has not yet been established.  High-temperature cooking may create kidney cancer causing carcinogens.Staying well hydrated, consuming phytates, which are in beans, nuts, seeds, and grains, and plant-based diets in general may help reduce kidney stone risk. Those with certain kidney stones should be cautious about nutritional yeast, turmeric, and beets. To eliminate uric acid kidney stones, drinking at least ten cups of water per day and reducing animal protein and salt intake may do the trick.Overall, plant-based diets appear to boost kidney health. Plant-based, fiber-rich diets may protect against kidney and other cancers, reduce the risk of childhood prediabetes (which can lead to kidney damage) and diabetes, the top cause of kidney failure. No surprise, then, that plant-based diets can be used to both help prevent and treat kidney failure.	-	cancer,heart disease,kidney health,heart health,meat,protein,cardiovascular

Similarly, intake of betel nuts or star fruit can potentially shut down the kidneys, and the safety of chamomile tea for those with kidney disease has not yet been established.  High-temperature cooking may create kidney cancer causing carcinogens.Staying well hydrated, consuming phytates, which are in beans, nuts, seeds, and grains, and plant-based diets in general may help reduce kidney stone risk. Those with certain kidney stones should be cautious about nutritional yeast, turmeric, and beets. To eliminate uric acid kidney stones, drinking at least ten cups of water per day and reducing animal protein and salt intake may do the trick.Overall, plant-based diets appear to boost kidney health. Plant-based, fiber-rich diets may protect against kidney and other cancers, reduce the risk of childhood prediabetes (which can lead to kidney damage) and diabetes, the top cause of kidney failure. No surprise, then, that plant-based diets can be used to both help prevent and treat kidney failure.	-	kidney disease,kidney health,plant-based diets,kidney

T-1055	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-stones/	kidney stones	In the U.S., 1 in 11 people suffer from kidney stones. This represents an increase from 20 years ago, when the data showed 1 in 20 were afflicted. In 75% of cases, kidney stones are comprised of calcium. Uric acid stones are the second most common form.Animal protein has been associated with the development of kidney stones, by increasing acid load, which fosters the stone production. In contrast, fresh fruit, fiber, and magnesium have been associated with a decreased risk of stone production. Those who have formed stones can reduce future risk of stone development by significantly reducing consumption of animal protein. Eliminating the consumption of animal protein not only decreases acid production, but also decreases the excretion of urate, which can form uric acid crystals.High sodium intake has also been associated with an increased risk of kidney stones. Yeast is high in purines, which can raise one’s risk of uric acid stones.Because soluble oxalates can bind calcium and form insoluble calcium oxalate stones, foods high in oxalates are also associated with an increased risk of kidney stones. Such foods include starfruit; beets; and high doses of turmeric (the equivalent of 6-7 capsules of turmeric supplement per day). Although cinnamon is as high in oxalates as tumeric, less than 10% of its oxalates are soluble, so significantly less are absorbed.Recommendations to prevent kidney stones include drinking 10 to 12 cups of water per day, decreasing animal protein intake, decreasing sodium consumption, and adding more vegetables into the diet. Phytates, found in beans, grains, nuts, and seeds have also been shown to prevent kidney stone formation.	-	kidney health,kidney disease,fruit,women's health,heart disease,vegetables,cancer,cardiovascular disease,vegetarians,inflammation,heart health,cardiovascular health,breast cancer,plant-based diets,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/12/who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/28/phytates-in-beans-anti-nutrient-or-anti-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-treatment-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-kidney-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sodium-skeptics-try-to-shake-up-the-salt-debate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-consume-curcumin-or-turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vitamin-c-supplements-prevent-colds-but-cause-kidney-stones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-star-fruit-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/purines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?fwp_search=sodium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kidney-stones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?fwp_search=tumeric,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oxalates/

T-1077	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lavender/	lavender	Lavender comes in many different forms: fresh, dried, essential oil, and capsule.Lavender has been found to change brain wave patterns. Therefore, its attracting greater scientific interest—from potential early indications for Alzheimer’s disease to generalized anxiety.Taken internally in capsule form, lavender has been found to effectively treat generalized anxiety, compared to benzodiazepines. Lavender may be a safer alternative, due to the side effects associated with many conventional treatments. Although dried lavender tea is commonly suggested to reduce stress, its objective physiological effects have yet to be determined.Lavender in its essential oil form has showed to improve overall mathematical performance, and may also be effective for acute management of migraine headaches, due to its analgesic effects. Using lavender essential oil could potentially stack up against conventional migraine treatments, helping about two-thirds of the time.	-	cancer,alternative medicine,women's health,rosemary,complementary medicine,medications,side effects,breast health,breast cancer,vegetables,endocrine disruptors,migraine headaches,men's health,elderly,hypertension	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/21/treating-migraines-with-lavender/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/14/using-lavender-to-treat-anxiety/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-herbal-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-migraine-headaches/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peanut-butter-smell-test-for-alzheimers/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/side-effects/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-herbal-tea/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/migraine-headaches,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/brain-waves/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stress/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/benzodiazepines/	
T-1079	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ldl-cholesterol/	LDL cholesterol	A plant-based diet high in fiber appears to lower total cholesterol and specifically LDL (bad) cholesterol (see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here).In accordance with the director of the Framingham Heart Study, the USDA Dietary Guidelines (see also here, here, here, here) recommend a more plant-based diet to lower cholesterol intake. Dr. Dean Ornish and the late Dr. Walter Kempner have promoted such diets for their health benefits. Unfortunately, many doctors may not be aware of this essential life-saving information (see also here and here), although that may be changing. A nutrition update for physicians published by Kaiser Permanente, the largest U.S. managed health care organization, has encouraged its doctors to recommend a plant-based diet to help patients lower their cholesterol. Cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as statins, may not only be far less effective than generally assumed (less than 5% effective over five years), but may have side effects such as increased breast cancer risk. Diet and/or lifestyle changes can be as effective as statins with positive side-effects.75% of heart attack patients are in the “normal” cholesterol range (see also here, here). Data suggests that cholesterol levels can never be too low. The average U.S. blood cholesterol level is so high that a large part of the “normal population” is at a very high risk of coronary heart disease. In fact, aiming for “below average” cholesterol is one of seven goals set by the American Heart Association to reduce U.S. heart disease deaths. The safe level for total cholesterol is likely 150 or lower (see also here), and the optimal “bad cholesterol” LDL level to achieve to avoid heart attacks may be 50 to 70.The American diet is so high in cholesterol-raising food components that even children as young as ten years old may show signs of atherosclerosis. There are rare genetic conditions that give people high cholesterol no matter what they eat, but such genetic defects occur in no more than 1 in 200 people. For most people, poor dietary choices seem to be the main culprit to their high cholesterol.Why do we need to lower our cholesterol? High cholesterol levels can raise heart disease risk (see also here, here, and here), the number one cause of death in the U.S.  Our stomach may act as a bioreactor for the oxidation of high-fat, cholesterol-rich foods. When LDL cholesterol infiltrates the lining of an artery and gets oxidized, it triggers an inflammatory response, and can eventually block the artery. Inflammation of the aorta, our largest artery can lead to an abdominal aortic aneurism, which can mean an unexpected painful death. Plant phytonutrients and antioxidants found in abundance in plant foods including fruits and vegetables can help prevent cholesterol from oxidizing.By preventing the buildup of cholesterol in our blood, we may be able to prevent atherosclerosis in our coronary arteries. Cholesterol crystallization may be what causes atherosclerotic plaque rupture, the trigger for heart attacks. Regardless of cholesterol size, LDL seems a risk factor for heart attacks.In addition to heart disease, high cholesterol has been linked to risk for adverse skin effects, lower back pain (see also here), sexual dysfunction (see also here, here, here and here), periodontitis, gallstones, type 2 diabetes risk (see also here and here), Alzheimer’s disease (see also here), increased risk for breast cancer, declining kidney function, and DNA damage leading to faster biological aging.A person trying to reduce cholesterol and bad cholesterol numbers should be cautious of consuming meat (see also here), dairy products, chicken, and eggs (see also here, here, here, here, here, here, and here). Surprising to many, switching from consuming beef to chicken and fish may not lower cholesterol. TMAO, which is produced in our guts when eating animal products, may increase the buildup of cholesterol in our arteries, and heme iron found in meat can contribute to atherosclerosis risk by oxidizing cholesterol.Brains contain more cholesterol than any other food, though in terms of the American diet, eggs are the top source of cholesterol (see also here and here). Eggs have so much cholesterol, they are not able to be labeled “healthy” under FDA guidelines, as just half of an egg goes over the safety limit. The daily consumption of the cholesterol found in a single egg may cut a woman’s life short as much as smoking 25,000 cigarettes over 15 years.Low carb diets seem to significantly raise LDL cholesterol levels, along with being overweight (see also here). For Americans, food prepared at home tends to have less cholesterol than food eaten at fast-food and sit-down restaurants. Eliminating saturated fat and dietary cholesterol can greatly lower cholesterol levels in the blood.Coconut oil and non-filtered coffee (see also here) may also raise cholesterol levels, although olive oil and nut consumption does not seem to have an affect. While a possible cholesterol reducer, red yeast rice is not recommended as the lovastatin dosing in it is unreliable. Unlike animal foods, plant foods do not contain dietary cholesterol. Whole-based plant foods that have been linked to lower cholesterol include Ceylon cinnamon; kale; legumes, including beans (see also here) and soy; Amla or Indian gooseberries (see also here); apples and dried apples (see also here); nuts (see also here, here, and here) and seeds including sesame seeds, pistachio nuts, flaxseeds (see also here and here), specifically Brazil nuts, walnuts (see also here), and almonds; kiwis;  green tea; cocoa; whole barley, whole oats (see also here and here); defatted coconut flakes; acai berries; possibly drinking water with baking soda; and hibiscus tea.	-	cholesterol,cardiovascular health,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,cancer,mortality,animal products,chicken,weight loss,vegetarians,diabetes,vegans,vegetables,saturated

T-1084	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/legumes/	legumes	Legumes include beans, lentils, split peas, chickpeas, soy, and peanuts. Most authorities agree that healthy diets should include beans. The USDA’s Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended that the public eat more legumes, which may fulfill both protein and vegetable needs, but 96% of Americans don’t eat the minimum recommended amount, with only a measly 3% of calories coming from beans and nuts in the standard American diet.Legumes, especially black beans and sprouted beans, provide antioxidants, fiber, lignans, folate, magnesium, and non-heme iron. Legumes may reduce risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, insulin resistance, provide for better blood sugar control, protect against prostate enlargement, improve bone density, protect against skin wrinkling, reduce levels of C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation), reduce high blood pressure, lower cholesterol (particularly LDL cholesterol), help reduce risk factors for and reverse metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and reduce risk for breast and other cancers. Overall, legume intake may be the most important dietary predictor of a long lifespan.

Lemon and cranberry juice suppressed the growth of liver cancer cells more than any other fruits in vitro. Eating sour fruit like lemons may risk greater erosion of tooth enamel, so rinsing with water after eating or drinking such fruit is advised to minimize any potential negative effects. When you’re flying, tea with lemon may be the healthiest beverage you can ask for, and lemons make a great addition to DIY fruit juice blends.	-	fruit,vegetables,fruit juice,vitamin C,oranges,cancer,mortality,citrus,tea,limes,DNA damage,heart health,garlic,celery,broccoli	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/06/citrus-to-reduce-muscle-fatigue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/10/which-common-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruits-vegetables-boost-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-fiber-really-prevent-diverticulosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-strengthen-the-mind-body-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-stop-hiccups/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-vinegar-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-tea-vs-white/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/shaking-salt-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/white-tea,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-tea-vs-white/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cranberry-juice,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/green-tea,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/	
T-1090	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lentils/	lentils	Lentils have the second-highest antioxidant content (behind black beans) among all tested legumes and offer significant levels of protein, iron, zinc, and folate as well. A diet rich in lentils and other legumes may help reduce cholesterol, hypertension, and the risk of prediabetes, fibrocystic breast disease, and prostate cancer proliferation. Lentils and other legumes may offer significant anti-inflammatory effects as well.Lentils are high in phytates, which may reduce the risk of colon cancer and may have protective effects against osteoporosis. Lentils and chickpeas appear to improve glycemic control (i.e., moderate blood sugar levels) not just at the meal when they are consumed, but even hours later or the next day. Lentils and other foods containing resistant starch may help block the accumulation in the colon of hydrogen sulfide, which is associated with inflammatory bowel disease.  The type of iron that appears to increase cancer risk (called “heme iron”) comes predominantly from meat; the safest form of iron (“non-heme iron”) is mostly found in lentils, other legumes, and several types of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Lentils and other whole foods contain magnesium, which may favorably affect a cluster of metabolic and inflammatory disorders including diabetes and heart disease.A high intake of lentils and other plant foods appears to be protective against skin wrinkles and may also improve periodontal healthNon-soy legumes like lentils appear to be more effective in decreasing bad cholesterol than soybeans. Sprouted lentils have twice the antioxidant content as unsprouted. Canned or boiled beans inhibited cancer cell growth in vitro significantly more than raw bean sprouts. Nutrition-wise, cooked and canned legumes are about the same, but the sodium content of canned beans can be 100 times that of cooked. Red lentils beat other lentils in overall nutritive benefits.Lentils’ and other legumes’ reputation for flatulence production may be undeserved: studies show that intestinal gas issues appear to return to normal levels after a few days or weeks of increased legume intake.	-	beans,vegetables,grains,fruit,heart health,cardiovascular health,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,processed

T-1092	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lettuce/	lettuce	Oak leaf and butter leaf lettuce make the top-ten list of vegetables high in nitrates, which may boost athletic performance and protect against heart disease. Lettuce is low in antioxidants, but even iceberg lettuce beats out most animal products. Red leaf lettuce has more antioxidants than green leaf lettuce.At the salad bar, the most nutrient-packed choice may be spinach, radicchio, or, in a pinch, romaine. Fat-free dressing may not be the best choice for salad, since some fat is needed to absorb the nutrients in these greens; the best choices are nut or seed-based dressings. It’s difficult to remove pesticidal residue from conventional lettuce and other plant foods; a 10% salt solution may work better.Iceberg lettuce is one of the least nutritious vegetables among all plant-based foods. Even federal recommendations for the minimum number of servings of fruits and vegetables do not count a serving of iceberg lettuce toward the total.	-	fruit,vegetables,meat,cancer,antioxidants,chicken,poultry,oxidative stress,phytonutrients,apples,strawberries,animal products,plant-based diets,fish,vitamin C	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/01/how-humans-benefit-from-stressed-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/01/foods-for-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/03/how-animal-proteins-may-trigger-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/23/can-antioxidant-rich-spices-counteract-the-effects-of-a-high-fat-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-make-your-own-fruit-and-vegetable-wash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruits-vegetables-boost-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/appropriating-plant-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-antioxidant-superstars-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-white-bread-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carrots-vs-baby-carrots-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-prevention-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-make-your-own-fruit-and-vegetable-wash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/spinach,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/seeds,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-white-bread-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carrots-vs-baby-carrots-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/	
T-1094	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leukemia/	leukemia	While total meat consumption, particularly hot dogs and other processed meat, poultry, and fish, seems to be related to the risk of developing different blood cancers, merely handling meat may also contribute to the risk. Pesticides seem to increase the risk of leukemia; however, choosing to buy organic can potentially mediate this risk. Pediatric CAT scans are also of concern with regards to childhood leukemia.On the other hand, plants may have a beneficial effect as vegetarians may have only a quarter of the risk of developing blood cancers compared to omnivores. Broccoli, acai berries, sweet potatoes, phytates (found naturally in whole plant foods), curcumin (the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric), periwinkle-based drugs and coffee all seem to have protective effects against leukemia.

T-1097	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifespan/	lifespan	Japan has the number one life expectancy of any nation while the US falls around 19th. A study recently suggested that eating a single serving of berries every day could add an extra year to our lifespan. The available evidence also suggests that eating nuts (specifically walnuts) and beans may extend our life (see also here). A plant based diet overall is thought to be capable of reversing heart disease and, thus, extending the lifespan (see also here, here, here, here) by almost 14 years. A study found that those eating one serving of fruits and vegetables a day died 19 months sooner than those eating five servings a day, a direct correlation between plant-based diets and lifespan. Just reducing the amount of meat one eats can increase lifespan. However, British vegetarians do not appear to live longer than British meat eaters (possibly due to the fact that they are less likely to supplement their diet with vitamin B12). Coffee has been associated with decreased all-cause mortality. Besides diet, sleeping 7 hours a night may maximize longevity. Severe caloric restriction has been found to extend the lives of animals in laboratories, and lowers our target of rapamycin, or TOR, which is a major determinant of aging. This caloric restriction can easily be met by reducing animal protein and increasing plant consumption. Meditation and stress management, along with a whole-food, plant-based, may slow the aging of our DNA. On the other hand, there are a few vitamin supplements that may increase all-cause mortality, or shorten the lifespan (see also here). Vitamin C and multivitamins don’t appear to offer net benefit.. Iron pills have also been linked to a shorter lifespan. Vitamin D, however, actually appears to make us live longer (see also here, here, here, here, here). Meat intake may increase total mortality according to the massive NIH-AARP study (the largest forward looking study of diet and health in history). Similarly, the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study linked red meat consumption to living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality. Not surprisingly then, people on animal-based, low carb diets have been found to live significantly shorter lives (increased risk of all cause mortality). A shorter life span has also been associated with untreated celiac disease, early puberty, consumption of processed meats and fish, kombucha tea, and eating just one egg a day has been found to shorten our lifespan (see also here, here, here). Dark fish consumption (such as salmon) has been linked with atrial fibrillation (a heartbeat arrhythmia, which can significantly shorten the lifespan). Moderate alcohol consumption does not appear to affect the lifespan of healthy people either positively or negatively.	-	longevity,mortality,heart health,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular

T-1099	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lignans/	lignans	Lignans are an anticancer plant compound found in red wine, whole grains, cruciferous vegetables, sesame seeds and flaxseeds.  Flaxseeds may contain up to 800 times more lignans than any other foods.  Flaxseeds also give you the most bang for your buck at just $1 per pound in the bulk food section. Just a teaspoon a day can give you your daily dose (although make sure it is ground flaxseed or else the nutrients may not be absorbed).  Those who eat a plant-based diet will most likely consume more lignans on a daily basis than those eating a diet rich in animal products.Lignans may reduce the risk of breast cancer along with prolonging the life of those living with breast cancer. Lignans may improve survival rate with breast cancer and cut mortality in half. Lignans found in flaxseeds may slow the growth of prostate cancer.  Studies have shown a decrease in PSA levels (biomarker of prostate cancer), decreased cell growth, and decreased cholesterol with daily flaxseed consumption.	-	flax seeds,women's health,cancer,breast cancer,seeds,plant-based diets,vegetarians,vegetables,vegans,breast health,fruit,grains,phytonutrients,breast cancer survival,bile acids	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/17/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/26/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/03/flaxseeds-for-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/14/breast-cancer-cells-feed-on-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/15/flaxseeds-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-clinical-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-flax-seeds-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-plant-based-diets-help-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-feeds-breast-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-vs-chia-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-epidemiological-evidence/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer-survival,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flax-seeds,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer	
T-1105	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lipitor/	Lipitor	Lipitor and other statins, which are meant to lower cholesterol, are some of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. However, the actual health benefits they provide are much lower than widely believed. Studies have found that patients typically credit Lipitor and the other statins to be about 100 times more effective than they actually are in the prevention of heart attacks.In reality, the best that statins may do is to lower one’s absolute risk of a heart attack by 3.1% over a span of 6 years.Up to one-third of patients on statins like Lipitor have adverse reactions, which include effects on the liver, kidneys, and muscles; abdominal pain; nausea, constipation, and dizziness; flushing; and skin and neurological disorders.  In February 2012, the FDA issued new alerts about side effects from statins, advising that they are also associated with cognitive effects, including memory loss and confusion; increased blood sugar; and new diagnoses of diabetes. The research surrounding these alerts suggested that for every 200 people taking statins, one of them will develop diabetes.  The effects of Lipitor and other statins on muscles deserve special attention. It has been found that 1-5% of people taking statins experience muscle damage, noting pain and weakness. Such side effects can be detected with blood tests. However, one study found that blood tests can be normal while patients are still experiencing muscle damage (based on muscle biopsies). Considering the number of elderly patients on statins, muscle weakness over time can increase fall risk.To decrease atherosclerosis (plaque formation in the arteries associated with cardiac disease), the goal is typically to achieve a serum total cholesterol level of less than 150. Lipitor and the other statins are often used to achieve this. However, a whole-food, plant-based diet has been shown effective in reaching this same goal, without Lipitor’s side effects.   Following a whole-food, plant-based diet may provide a 60% absolute risk reduction of heart attack over a period of less than 4 years. Put another way, 99.4% of patients who maintain such a diet may avoid a major cardiac event, such as dying of a heart attack.	-	cholesterol,heart health,medications,cardiovascular disease,statins,side effects,heart disease,mortality,plant-based diets,cancer,women's health,cardiovascular health,breast cancer,liver health,LDL cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/28/soymilk-shake-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/08/how-well-do-cholesterol-lowering-drugs-actually-work/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/12/how-grapefruit-affects-prescription-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/23/generic-lipitor-is-not-the-answer-to-our-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/13/cholesterol-lowering-in-a-nut-shell/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-actual-benefit-of-diet-vs-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-do-you-want-fries-with-that-lipitor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/statin-muscle-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-versus-drugs-for-high-cholesterol/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/statins,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes	
T-1114	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-cancer/	liver cancer	Major causes of liver cancer are diseases such as hepatitis and consuming too much alcohol. But there are plenty of ways to help lower our risk of liver cancer by dietary means. Eating broccoli, cranberries, lemons, amla, walnuts and pecans may lower our risk of liver cancer and cancer in general, as may increasing the amount of phytates in our blood, which are most commonly found in whole-foods such as beans, nuts and grains. Recently, coffee has been shown to decrease the liver cancer risk of those that consume alcohol by 50% (but simply not drinking alcohol is a better solution!). Sea vegetables may also suppress the risk of liver cancer, but be wary of their iodine content and avoid Hiziki (or Hijiki) seaweed and Spirulina. Lastly, it’s best to avoid added sugars, such as high fructose corn syrup and table sugar, as that can lead to fat build-up in our livers.	-	cancer,mortality,fruit,liver health,vegetables,women's health,alcohol,colon cancer,vegetarians,antioxidants,meat,plant-based diets,animal products,liver disease,breast cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/27/dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/10/coffee-for-hepatitis-c/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/12/anti-cancer-nutrient-synergy-in-cranberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/10/coffee-caveats/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-skin-cancer-from-the-inside-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-change-your-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/seeing-red-no-3-coloring-to-dye-for/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liver-toxicity-due-to-broccoli-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hepatitis-e-virus-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-penis-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-liver-cancer-with-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liver-toxicity-due-to-broccoli-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hepatitis-e-virus-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-liver-cancer-with-coffee/	
T-1115	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-disease/	liver disease	The liver is, among many other functions, a detoxification organ. Different factors can raise the risk of liver disease. Poultry workers may have nine times the risk of both liver, pancreatic, and penis cancer. The standard diabetes treatment which usually involves oral hypoglycemic medications and injected insulin, can lead to liver disease. A potential side-effect of statins, often prescribed to lower cholesterol, is liver damage. Drugs often given to rheumatoid arthritis patients may be toxic to the liver. Metabolic syndrome can put people at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic inflammation can cause chronic hepatitis, which may lead to liver cancer.There are also foods which may be toxic to the liver such as noni juice; Herbalife supplements; Juice Plus+ supplements; spirulina; BPA in plastics; cod liver oil; red dye #3; pesticides; coumarin, found in some types of cinnamon; industrial fructose, such as in high fructose corn syrup; overconsumption of Brazil nuts; kava kava; high intake of pork and alcohol; and green tea supplements.Fatty build-up in the liver appears to play a role in the development of diabetes. Animal protein intake can boost IGF-1 production from our liver, which in turn can increase cancer risk.The following appear to promote liver health: green tea, cruciferous vegetables, Indian gooseberries, turmeric, whole grains, chlorella, and broccoli.

T-1117	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-health/	liver health	The liver is, among many other functions, a detoxification organ. Different factors can raise the risk of liver disease. Poultry workers may have nine times the risk of both liver, pancreatic, and penis cancer. The standard diabetes treatment which usually involves oral hypoglycemic medications and injected insulin, can lead to liver disease. A potential side-effect of statins, often prescribed to lower cholesterol, is liver damage. Drugs often given to rheumatoid arthritis patients may be toxic to the liver. Metabolic syndrome can put people at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic inflammation can cause chronic hepatitis, which may lead to liver cancer.There are also foods which may be toxic to the liver such as noni juice; Herbalife supplements; Juice Plus+ supplements; spirulina; BPA in plastics; cod liver oil; red dye #3; pesticides; coumarin, found in some types of cinnamon; industrial fructose, such as in high fructose corn syrup; overconsumption of Brazil nuts; kava kava; high intake of pork and alcohol; and green tea supplements.Fatty build-up in the liver appears to play a role in the development of diabetes. Animal protein intake can boost IGF-1 production from our liver, which in turn can increase cancer risk.The following appear to promote liver health: green tea, cruciferous vegetables, Indian gooseberries, turmeric, whole grains, chlorella, and broccoli. Possibly protective against liver cancer: black beans, cranberries, coffee, and dietary phytates, found in beans, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.     	-	liver disease,medications,grains,fruit,fat,men's

T-1121	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/longevity/	longevity	Japan has the number one life expectancy of any nation while the US falls around 19th. A study recently suggested that eating a single serving of berries every day could add an extra year to our lifespan. The available evidence also suggests that eating nuts (specifically walnuts) and beans may extend our life (see also here). A plant based diet overall is thought to be capable of reversing heart disease and, thus, extending the lifespan (see also here, here, here, here) by almost 14 years. A study found that those eating one serving of fruits and vegetables a day died 19 months sooner than those eating five servings a day, a direct correlation between plant-based diets and lifespan. Just reducing the amount of meat one eats can increase lifespan. However, British vegetarians do not appear to live longer than British meat eaters (possibly due to the fact that they are less likely to supplement their diet with vitamin B12). Coffee has been associated with decreased all-cause mortality. Besides diet, sleeping 7 hours a night may maximize longevity. Severe caloric restriction has been found to extend the lives of animals in laboratories, and lowers our target of rapamycin, or TOR, which is a major determinant of aging. This caloric restriction can easily be met by reducing animal protein and increasing plant consumption. Meditation and stress management, along with a whole-food, plant-based, may slow the aging of our DNA. On the other hand, there are a few vitamin supplements that may increase all-cause mortality, or shorten the lifespan (see also here). Vitamin C and multivitamins don’t appear to offer net benefit.. Iron pills have also been linked to a shorter lifespan. Vitamin D, however, actually appears to make us live longer (see also here, here, here, here, here). Meat intake may increase total mortality according to the massive NIH-AARP study (the largest forward looking study of diet and health in history). Similarly, the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study linked red meat consumption to living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality. Not surprisingly then, people on animal-based, low carb diets have been found to live significantly shorter lives (increased risk of all cause mortality). A shorter life span has also been associated with untreated celiac disease, early puberty, consumption of processed meats and fish, kombucha tea, and eating just one egg a day has been found to shorten our lifespan (see also here, here, here). Dark fish consumption (such as salmon) has been linked with atrial fibrillation (a heartbeat arrhythmia, which can significantly shorten the lifespan). Moderate alcohol consumption does not appear to affect the lifespan of healthy people either positively or negatively.	-	heart disease,mortality,cardiovascular health,heart health,cardiovascular

T-1126	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/low-fat-diets/	low-fat diets	Fatty foods have been shown to be a leading cause of obesity and may actually be addictive. And substituting just 1% of saturated fat in your diet can add nearly a whole year’s worth of length to our telomeres (telomere length is a measure of cellular aging).  Consuming less animal fat may reduce cholesterol. Consuming more plant-based fat in the form of whole foods, though, such as those found in nuts and avocados, may actually be good for you. Some vitamins and other phytonutrients are fat-soluble, meaning they are best absorbed in combination with a source of fat, so choosing a low-fat or fat-free salad dressing to top your salad may not be as good for you (unless you add some walnuts or other healthy source of fat on top).	-	fat,cardiovascular health,heart disease,body fat,animal fat,heart health,mortality,weight loss,plant-based diets,cancer,cardiovascular disease,LDL cholesterol,cholesterol,vegetarians,vegans	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/15/stopping-heart-disease-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/29/quadrupling-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/14/breast-cancer-cells-feed-on-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/24/whats-driving-americas-obesity-problem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/28/phytates-in-beans-anti-nutrient-or-anti-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/28/how-fatty-foods-may-affect-our-love-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/24/want-to-be-healthier-change-your-taste-buds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/16/comparing-vegans-arteries-to-runners/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/was-it-the-flaxseed-fat-restriction-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-fat-or-whole-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fatty-meals-may-impair-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-treatment-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arteries-of-vegans-vs-runners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slimming-the-gecko-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-set-up-to-fail/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-fatty-foods-addictive/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-our-taste-buds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-feeds-breast-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-exercise-to-sustain-weight-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-fat-or-whole-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-set-up-to-fail/	
T-1129	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lung-cancer/	lung cancer	Lung cancer can grow for 20 years before being detected. A plant-based diet, however, may help prevent lung cancer. Total meat consumption (especially processed meat) has been associated with lung cancer risk. Eggs also may contain toxic dioxins, which appear to increase the odds of getting lung cancer.The inclusion of broccoli and other cruciferous and allium veggies in your diet is an effective dietary-based chemo-preventive strategy and seems to protect DNA from mutation. Cruciferous vegetables may be antiproliferative, and produce anti-tumor activity which may inhibit several types of cancer cell growth including leukemia, prostate, breast, cervical, and lung cancer. Similarly, Indian gooseberries also appear can also be effective in slowing cancer cell growth as shown in a petri dish. Supplements do not work as well as whole foods. In fact, lutein pills have even actually been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer.There is a concern for the risk of respiratory tract cancer from breathing the smoke caused by frying beef, pork and soy based foods. Other airborne contaminants such as asbestos are still present in many older buildings. Green tea is rich in flavonoids, which may explain why Asians have less lung cancer, despite their higher smoking rates. Drinking green tea also provides phytocannabinoids (which ease nausea, pain and have a calming effect) without the potential for increased lung cancer risk associated with smoking marijuana.	-	cancer,smoking,tobacco,cardiovascular disease,industry influence,cardiovascular health,heart disease,heart health,plant-based diets,vegetarians,exercise,vegans,breast cancer,animal products,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/07/virus-in-chicken-could-be-linked-to-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/27/dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/12/how-curry-can-kill-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/08/a-low-methionine-diet-may-help-starve-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/29/why-some-dietary-cholesterol-studies-fail-to-show-harm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-evidence-that-salt-raises-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-cancer-does-lunch-meat-cause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industry-response-to-plants-not-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sodium-skeptics-try-to-shake-up-the-salt-debate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-explains-the-french-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-green-tea-help-treat-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/american-medical-association-complicity-big-tobacco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-compared-cigarette-smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-palatability-of-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-a-colon-cancer-mystery/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-did-doctors-not-know-about-the-risks-of-hormone-therapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-wait-until-your-doctor-kicks-the-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funded-research-bias/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pork,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://broccoli,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nausea,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cervical-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/green-tea,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/hot-dogs-leukemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leukemia,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/lutein-lycopene-and-selenium-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beef,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cannabis-receptors-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/

Some foods we may want to avoid to protect our lungs include processed meat, the artificial butter flavoring diacetyl (which has been linked to serious lung disease in microwave popcorn consumers), foods cooked using high temperature cooking methods, and even the fumes generated by frying meat may raise the risk of respiratory diseases.A whole-food, plant-based diet may help prevent and treat COPD, and help prevent asthma and improve lung function in asthma patients. Supplements, however, do not seem to work. Consuming less methionine (found in animal products) may lower lung cancer risk, and amla, also known as Indian gooseberries, may reduce lung cancer cell growth in vitro.	-	lung health,cancer,asthma,smoking,vegetables,fruit,plant-based diets,allergies,eczema,heart health,heart disease,oxidative stress,vegans,vegetarians,cardiovascular health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/08/a-low-methionine-diet-may-help-starve-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/29/avoid-butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/09/using-diet-to-treat-asthma-and-eczema/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/02/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-treat-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-artificial-butter-flavor-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pretty-in-pee-nk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppers-and-parkinsons-the-benefits-of-smoking-without-the-risks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-cats-or-dogs-more-protective-for-childrens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clinical-studies-on-acai-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-artificial-butter-flavor-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/methionine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lung-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/copd,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/

Consuming less methionine (found in animal products) may lower lung cancer risk, and amla, also known as Indian gooseberries, may reduce lung cancer cell growth in vitro.	-	vegetables,heart disease,smoking,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,lung disease,heart health,fruit,cancer,tobacco,plant-based diets,mortality,exercise,vegetarians,high blood pressure	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/12/evidence-based-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/12/how-curry-can-kill-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/20/can-peppermint-improve-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/09/using-diet-to-treat-asthma-and-eczema/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/02/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-treat-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-medicine-or-evidence-biased/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-artificial-butter-flavor-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppers-and-parkinsons-the-benefits-of-smoking-without-the-risks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-the-blues-with-greens-mao-inhibitors-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-cats-or-dogs-more-protective-for-childrens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxygenating-blood-with-nitrate-rich-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caution-anti-inflammatory-foods-in-the-third-trimester/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/enhancing-athletic-performance-with-peppermint/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clinical-studies-on-acai-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-reprogramming-cancer-cell-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-artificial-butter-flavor-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/methionine,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lung-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/copd,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/

T-1137	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lymphoma/	lymphoma	Lymphoma is cancer of the lymph nodes, which are dense collections of white blood cells embedded in a matrix of microscopic fibers and channels located throughout the body (neck, armpit, groin, etc.). The mortality rate varies with the kind and extent of lymphoma and many other factors. Depending on the type and extent of the disease, lymphoma is usually treated with chemotherapy.As with all cancers, lymphoma seems to be the result of a genetic mutation that causes out-of-control cell growth. In the largest ever prospective study of diet and cancer, poultry was associated with the highest risk of lymphoma; for every 50 grams of poultry consumed daily, the risk of lymphoma may increase anywhere from 50% to nearly 400%. Viruses may also have a role in cancer. Studies on bovine leukemia virus, a viral infection in cattle that can make its way into milk, suggest that dairy– and egg-borne viruses may play a role in causing lymphoma (and leukemia—cancer of cells in the blood). This suggests that, in some cases, some types of lymphoma and leukemia may actually be zoonotic diseases–disease in animals that causes disease in humans.Given the strength of evidence associating cancer with animal products, decreasing or eliminating animal products from the diet may provide significant benefits. A diet rich in vegetables, grains, fruit, and nuts has been shown to provide crucial anti-cancer advantages.	-	cancer,mortality,leukemia,dairy,animal products,meat,vegetables,beef,women's health,cancer survival,fruit,breast cancer,soda,non-Hodgkin lymphoma,viral infections	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/07/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/03/how-animal-proteins-may-trigger-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/18/why-do-vegan-women-have-fewer-female-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/06/which-pets-improve-childrens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/17/poultry-and-penis-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-vitamin-c-in-the-treatment-of-terminal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pets-human-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-mgus-and-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-aspartame-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-milk-infectious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vitamin-d-supplements-reduce-the-risk-of-dying-from-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-a-neutropenic-diet-necessary-for-cancer-patients/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chemotherapy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leukemia,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/viral-infections,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bovine-leukemia-virus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/zoonotic-disease	
T-1144	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mad-cow-disease/	mad cow disease	Mad Cow Disease, also called bovine spongiform encephalopathy is an irreversible nerve tissue disorder that occurs when certain proteins in the brain go awry, folding abnormally. These twisted proteins called prions replicate, spreading throughout the animal’s brain, destroying brain function and ultimately leading to death.Humans can develop a similarly devastating disorder called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  Neither of these diseases is contagious unless the brain or significant parts of the nervous system containing prions are ingested by another. For humans, this has only been a problem in parts of the world where cannibalism is practiced. For cows, contagion has thought to have occurred with the practice of feeding livestock with its own meat by-products. This forced bovine cannibalism has produced meat that when consumed, infected humans with a variant of the brain-wasting protein. Several ‘human cases’ of Mad Cow disease (officially called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or vCJD) were isolated in the United Kingdom leading to global concern. In the United States, the practice of feeding cows to cows has been banned and legislation to restrict bovine brain and spinal cord from food distribution has been enacted. Food safety advocates call for extreme caution in monitoring the disease. A point of concern is that prions are not destroyed by normal cooking temperatures. The insidious proteins have been found to survive temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Another point of contention is the fact that vCJD produces many of the same symptoms as dementia and in theory, is frequently misdiagnosed as early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.	-	prion disease,brain health,neurotoxins,meat,fish,brain disease,seafood,heavy metals,mercury,vegetarians,omnivores,Alzheimer’s disease,beef,factory farming practices,FDA	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/25/mad-cow-california-is-the-milk-supply-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/03/supreme-court-case-meat-industry-sues-to-keep-downed-animals-in-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/01/foie-gras-ban-in-california-human-health-implications/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-intestines-for-food-and-cosmetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mad-fish-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sexually-transmitted-fish-toxin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/factory-farming-practices/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cooking-temperature/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dementia	
T-1163	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/marketing/	marketing	The Federal government spends about 10 million dollars a year to educate people about healthy eating; candy corporations may spend twice as much as that just launching a new candy bar. Sadly, U.S. taxpayer subsidies have resulted in low production costs for unhealthy commodities that in turn mean profit incentives for companies to market more unhealthy foods. Also, vegetables can’t be patented and profitable like new pharmaceuticals, and so there is not a lot of money put into marketing them.Fish oil has been marketed as reducing inflammation. However, this may not be true. Fish oil has been found to contain PCBs and DDT, which can be detrimental to health, despite chemical company ads to the contrary. Arsenic is marketed to poison the parasites with which factory farmed chickens are often infested. The meat industry has advertised that slimming phytoestrogens have been found in animal products, but at quantities up to a thousand times lower than in plant foods.The meat industry advertises that meat consumption is not linked to cancer based on a study conducted over one summer overseen by a for-profit firm paid for by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.	-	eggs,chicken,fish,heart disease,safety limits,nutrition myths,cardiovascular disease,heart health,seafood,supplements,industry influence,animal products,children,poultry,milk	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/08/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/26/peeks-behind-the-egg-industry-curtain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/25/our-tax-dollars-subsidize-unhealthy-foods/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-really-in-hot-dogs-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-slimming-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cocoa-good-chocolate-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whose-health-unaffected-by-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-great-bad-killer-fats/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/factory-farming-practices/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-really-in-hot-dogs-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-slimming-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ddt,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish-oil,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/',http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/national-beef-cattlemans-association/	
T-1173	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mcdonalds/	McDonalds	Each year, the food industry spends billions of dollars on advertising, which may result preschoolers preferring the taste of foods thought to be from McDonald’s that they don’t even sell. Fast food’s large budget may result in conflicts of interest. For example, McDonald’s, Pepsi, and Coca-Cola have supported The American Academy of Family Physicians. Similarly, the USDA Dietary Guidelines Committee has been made of up individuals funded by McDonald’s, Coca Cola, other processed food companies.Fast food locations like McDonald’s offer high-fat meals that seem to raise the risk of acid reflux, expose consumers to industrial chemical carcinogens and advanced glycation end product (AGE), and harm arterial function. The actual percentage of muscle meat in burgers from fast food restaurants like McDonald’s may range from 2% to 14.8%. 	-	vegetables,fruit,cholesterol,meat,dairy,eggs,antioxidants,fat,smoking,beans,industry influence,cancer,tobacco,grains,animal products	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/10/coca-cola-stopped-sponsoring-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/20/what-do-eggs-do-to-our-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/21/time-hospitals-stop-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/07/dietary-guideline-graphics-from-the-food-pyramid-to-myplate-harvards-healthy-eating-plate-and-pcrms-power-plate/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coconut-milk-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hospitals-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-a-sugary-grave/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-do-you-want-fries-with-that-lipitor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-gerd-acid-reflux-heartburn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-mans-diet-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-conflicts-of-interest/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hospitals-selling-sickness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cocacola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pepsi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-a-sugary-grave/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-do-you-want-fries-with-that-lipitor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-gerd-acid-reflux-heartburn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-conflicts-of-interest/	
T-1175	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/	meat	The new USDA Dietary Guidelines suggest moderating the consumption of meat (see videos here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here). A healthy eating score can be determined by the proportion of foods with phytochemicals (plant nutrients) a person consumes. Eating vegetarian also has been positively associated with less disease, surgery, and medication use, fewer allergies (see here, here), and improved lung function in COPD (emphysema) patients (see also here). A plant-based diet truly may be the best investment for our health. Meat eaters appear to be at a higher risk for certain cancers (see also here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here). The high levels of nitrosamines (carcinogenic compounds found in processed meats) may be partially to blame for this (see also here, here, here, here). The carcinogenic chemicals formed by the cooking of muscles (especially chicken) may also pose a danger. And since food is a package deal, even if meat is a “good” source of certain nutrients, it may not be good for us in the end (because of the other nutritional baggage, such as cholesterol and saturated animal fat). Cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, abdominal aortic aneurysms, weight gain and obesity, diabetes (see also here), Alzheimer’s disease, spongiform encephalopathies, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and essential tremor may be associated with meat consumption. Premature breast development in girls has also been linked to meat eating. Xenoestrogens have been linked with early onset puberty; hormones in meat may also be responsible for female infertility. Lymphoma has been linked to higher meat consumption, specifically poultry consumption. Saturated fat intake (found primarily in cheese, chicken, ice cream, desserts) has been linked with an increased risk of dying from breast cancer. A recent Harvard study found meat-eating to be positively associated with increased overall mortality, including increased cancer and heart disease mortality (see also here). Transfat, saturated fat, and cholesterol are found primarily in animal products (see also here, here). This is significant because the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood may be the single best indicator of heart disease risk (see also here). Creatine supplements appear to have a minimal effect on meat eaters; furthermore, taking creatine supplements is not advised due to potential contamination with heavy metals. Putrescine, a chemical compound found in meat, cheese, and fermented foods (highest levels found in canned tuna), may be carcinogenic (see also here). Meat also may contain glycotoxins (AGEs), which may contribute to the aging process, but meat lacks the ability to boost telomerase activity, which may slow aging. Eating meat and eggs also results in higher levels of arachidonic acid in the body; this has been linked with inflammation, including inflammation of the brain, which may contribute to depression, anxiety, and stress. Other contaminants that may be found in meat, fish, and eggs: PCBs, dioxins, ammonia in fast food, anabolic steroids, drug residues, E. coli, banned pesticides, and industrial carcinogens. And retail meat in the U.S. has also been found to be contaminated with “superbugs” (see here, here, here, here) Exposing children to fecal bacteria from meat by placing the child in shopping cart baskets with raw meat packages is a risk factor for food poisoning. Similarly, while cooking will kill these fecal bacteria, cross contamination in the kitchen before the meat is cooked is a risk factor. A certain strain of these fecal bacteria can, in rare cases, result in Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, rare genetic disorders may require compounds in meat to be consumed as a supplement. Poultry workers also have higher rates of many diseases, thought to be due to exposure to poultry viruses and microorganisms at increased rates (see also here, here, here, here). The safest source of vitamin B12 is probably fortified foods and supplements rather than animal sources; getting it exclusively from eggs, for instance, would result in extremely high cholesterol consumption. Plant foods have more antioxidant power than animal foods (see also here). Traditional American breakfasts lack antioxidants, and an Indian gooseberry-spiked breakfast smoothie is a much healthier option.

T-1179	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/medical-education/	medical education	Nutrition education is severely lacking in medical school. For example, medical students may get less than 20 hours learning about nutrition in their four years of medical education, and only a quarter of medical schools require a single course on nutrition.Sadly, the percentage of medical school instructors who think more nutrition education is needed has dropped since 2004. One study that tested basic nutrition knowledge showed that some patients knew more about nutrition than doctors. Due to their training, medical students tend to be biased in favor of drug treatments and against dietary interventions for chronic disease management. Doctors are not taught how to counsel patients to make lifestyle changes to reduce their risk of chronic disease. Also, lifestyle medicine isn’t really profitable for physicians.In 2011, a bill drafted by Dr. John McDougall was introduced in California to mandate that physicians get continuing medical education in nutrition. But, physician trade groups such as the California Medical Association came out in opposition of the bill which required that doctors get seven hours of nutrition training any time before 2017. Eventually the bill passed, but the hourly requirement for any nutrition education was dropped.	-	mortality,chronic diseases,lifestyle medicine,heart disease,tobacco,cardiovascular disease,plant-based diets,industry influence,smoking,surgery,cardiovascular health,heart health,medical ethics,Introductory Videos,evidence-based medicine	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/06/do-you-meet-the-simple-seven/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/08/how-well-do-cholesterol-lowering-drugs-actually-work/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/12/evidence-based-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/19/dont-forget-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/24/understanding-lifestyle-medicine-from-the-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/05/how-to-treat-prediabetes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/14/nutrition-education-in-medicine-a-doctor-a-day-keeps-the-apples-away/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/10/medical-care-the-third-leading-cause-of-death/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-medicine-or-evidence-biased/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-you-should-care-about-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/disclosing-conflicts-interest-medical-research/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/find-out-if-your-doctor-takes-drug-company-money/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convincing-doctors-to-embrace-lifestyle-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/physicians-may-be-missing-their-most-important-tool/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taking-personal-responsibility-for-your-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dr-burkitts-f-word-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-actual-benefit-of-diet-vs-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-doctors-responded-to-being-named-a-leading-killer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-kept-secret-in-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-meet-the-simple-seven/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-story-of-nutritionfacts-org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-prevention-is-worth-a-ton-of-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-philosophy-of-nutritionfacts-org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-doctors-make-the-grade/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-is-the-standard-of-care-for-prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-get-colonoscopies-starting-at-age-50/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-a-neutropenic-diet-necessary-for-cancer-patients/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-medicine-or-evidence-biased/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/physicians-may-be-missing-their-most-important-tool/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-doctors-make-the-grade/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/california-medical-association/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-is-the-standard-of-care-for-prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifestyle-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dr-burkitts-f-word-diet/

T-1184	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/medications/	medications	 Lifestyle vs. MedicationDoctors often prescribe medications instead of advocating for a healthy lifestyle, even though diet and exercise changes may lead to better outcomes than medication. For example, statin drugs may be able to reduce absolute risk of a heart attack by 3.1% over six years, while a whole-food, plant-based diet has an absolute risk reduction of 60% in less than four years.On the whole, vegetarians have lower chronic disease rates than non-vegetarians and take fewer medications. Plant-based diets provide a potential alternative or supplement to drugs and may be effective at preventing, and sometimes even reversing some chronic diseases, including:Ironically, while many doctors are skeptical of the ability of whole, plant-based foods to treat disease, many modern medications, including aspirin, are based on plants that have been used as medicine for centuries. Unlike drugs, plants can’t be patented, thus get scarcer research funding for possible therapeutic uses. Because of the potential profit from patented drugs, pharmaceutical companies often look at how a whole food can be made into a patentable pill. The pharmaceutical industry is starting to shift away from single target drugs to drugs that affect multiple pathways, like many plant compounds.Concerns about MedicationWhile medications can be helpful in treating chronic diseases, their effectiveness is sometimes overstated. Pharmaceutical companies have been known to withhold results that would indicate their drugs may not be as effective as advertised. In one survey, when patients were presented with the real benefit of the drugs they were taking, 90% said they wouldn’t bother taking them.The potential side effects of medications is another concern. In fact, prescription drugs (not including medication errors) are the sixth-leading cause of death in the US Potential side-effects of some drugs may be so serious that some have argued, in certain situations, giving the patient a placebo may be a better option.It’s important to be aware of potential drug-food interactions because certain phytochemicals in plants, like grapefruit, can affect the metabolism of drugs in the body. Depending on the dose, plant-derived products can be toxic, such as Cassia cinnamon.Prescription drugs may also pollute the environment. Drugs excreted in our urine often pollute our waterways, which can then bioaccumulate in fish. Purity of medications can also be an issue; some Ayurvedic medicines have been found to be contaminated with heavy metals.	-	cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart health,heart

T-1191	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/memory/	memory	Reducing total cholesterol to under 150 may be necessary to eliminate our risk of heart attacks, our number one killer. This can be accomplished with statins, which may cause memory loss, or a plant-based diet and other lifestyle modifications.Berries, 30 minutes of daily aerobic exercise, and getting 7-8 hours sleep may be helpful for improving short-term memory function and decreasing cognitive decline.Creatine supplementation may improve memory, but the effect appearsmore pronounced in vegetarians than in meat-eaters. Vegetarians and vegans should take a B12 supplement to prevent brain loss. Total vegetable consumption is associated with improved fact-based memory. Soy and caffeine have been found to protect and enhance memory function, and alternate day fasting was found to produce a dramatic improvement in memory.Elevated alkylphenol levels in nursing mothers, due to contaminated seafood consumption, may impact memory function in infants and a rare toxin found in seafood may permanently compromise short-term memory function. Consumption of high levels of seafood may also cause neurobehavioral issues such as memory loss, possibly due to high mercury levels. Pregnant women who eat licorice may be risking diminished memory function to their unborn babies.	-	brain health,brain disease,fish,dementia,Alzheimer’s disease,meat,seafood,omega-3 fatty acids,depression,persistent organic pollutants,EPA,DHA,cognition,mental health,mortality	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/21/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/01/two-kiwi-fruits-an-hour-before-bedtime/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/21/schoolchildren-should-drink-more-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-cognitive-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/http:/nutritionfacts.org/video/does-tofu-cause-dementia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amnesic-seafood-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-brain-food-older-adults/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-dha-supplements-to-boost-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-brain-loss-with-b-vitamins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-tofu-cause-dementia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-fog/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caloric-restriction-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-licorice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-slimming-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-memory-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/creatine-brain-fuel-supplementation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caloric-restriction-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/seafood,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifestyle-medicine,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-cognitive-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/http:/nutritionfacts.org/video/does-tofu-cause-dementia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amnesic-seafood-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-licorice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cognition,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-memory-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/creatine-brain-fuel-supplementation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-brain-loss-with-b-vitamins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/statins,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-fog/	
T-1192	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mens-health/	men's health	The presence of meat in the diet, particularly processed meat, may increase one’s risk of prostate cancer, as may consumption of fried foods, dairy products and eggs. A plant-based diet may improve erectile dysfunction.Men might be cautious about using lavender; in spite of its apparent efficacy in relieving anxiety, it may have estrogenic effects (as might nettle tea). Soy consumption, on the other hand, has been found not to decrease male fertility. Sex steroid hormones found in meat, dairy and eggs, and saturated fat intake in general may be one cause of the global drop in male fertility.Eating the spice fenugreek may improve muscle strength and weight lifting power in addition to helping lower the risk of cancer. Eating foods rich in carotenoids and vitamin C may be associated with a reduction of lower urinary tract infections in men. Mushrooms are the best source of the antioxidant amino acid ergothioneine, found in seminal fluid.Xenoestrogens (human-made pesticide chemicals found mostly in fish) may negatively influence male sperm counts. Radioactivity present in seafood may lead to low sperm count.Advice to eat oily fish or take fish oil to lower risk of heart disease, stroke or mortality may no longer be supported by the balance of available evidence. Endocrine-disrupting industrial toxins found in fish and seafood may affect genital development of boys and sexual function of men.Vegetarian men should be sure to eat whole grains, nuts and beans every day to meet their zinc requirements.	-	women's health,cancer,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,heart health,prostate cancer,heart disease,breast cancer,prediabetes,plant-based diets,diabetes,fruit,meat,kidney disease,obesity	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/31/why-is-milk-consumption-associated-with-more-bone-fractures/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/16/dietary-estrogens-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/14/role-diet-declining-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/07/monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-bpa-hasnt-been-banned/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-best-lowers-phthalate-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-adult-exposure-phthalates/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pomegranate-vs-placebo-for-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/music-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-gerd-acid-reflux-heartburn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-diet-in-declining-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vitamin-c-supplements-prevent-colds-but-cause-kidney-stones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-compared-cigarette-smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bpa-on-receipts-getting-under-our-skin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-prostate-cancer-and-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ginger-for-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-fenugreek-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-mans-diet-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/mushrooms,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/lavender,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fenugreek,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/zinc,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/xenoestrogens,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/erectile-dysfunction/	
T-1195	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/menopause/	menopause	In a recent study, post-menopausal breast cancer survivors on Tamoxifen who ate the most soy had the lowest rates of breast cancer recurrence. This was also true of lignan intake (found in especially high levels in flax seeds). Postmenopausal women with breast cancer were found to have higher estrogen levels in the blood than women without breast cancer; however, women on a vegetarian diet had the lowest levels. This may help explain why breast cancer risk may be reduced by a vegetarian diet. Tumors in post-menopausal women do not have easy access to estrogen, which appears to feed tumors. These tumors may then turn to creating estrogen themselves; mushrooms have been found to disrupt this process. Eating soy foods appears to help with hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause. And daily dried apple consumption may promote cardiovascular health in post-menopausal women.	-	women's health,cancer,breast cancer,estrogen,breast disease,meat,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,animal products,heart health,hormones,cardiovascular health,bone health,breast health,Premarin	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/05/epa-dioxin-limit-has-national-chicken-council-worried-products-could-be-declared-unfit-for-consumption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/04/are-bioidentical-hormones-safe/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-did-doctors-not-know-about-the-risks-of-hormone-therapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-bioidentical-hormones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-foods-menopause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-foods-menopause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/	
T-1197	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mental-health/	mental health	Plant-based diets appear to influence mental health positively. Vegetarians, in cross-sectional and interventional studies, showed fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and mood disturbance than omnivores.  Higher levels of antioxidants in the blood from plant sources have been associated with a significantly lower risk of depression, and lower suicide rates have been tied to higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, nuts, and soy and lower intake of dairy, meat, and fish.Chicken has been linked to a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Arachidonic acid, found at particularly high levels in chicken and eggs, produces inflammatory compounds that may affect our brains. Chicken has low levels of omega 3 fatty acid, a vital nutrient for the brain. Toxoplasma brain parasites from meat have been linked to schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. Glycotoxins—found primarily in chicken, pork, beef, and fish—increase the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s. High consumption of fish has been associated with an increased risk of mental disorders, lower testosterone (which can lead to depression), and chronic fatigue syndrome and depression.Frequent ingestion of the artificial sweetener, aspartame, may increase risk of depression and other mental disorders. Artificial coloring in foods may increase impulsivity, inattentiveness and hyperactivity in children. Children whose mothers ate more licorice during pregnancy were more prone to attention, speech, and visual-spatial ability problems. Research has shown that certain foods and nutrients may have positive effects on mental illnesses. Green tea may help improve one’s mood. Eating seeds high in tryptophan may be an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder. The serotonin contained in fruit has the potential to alleviate depression. Probiotics may help decrease symptoms of anxiety, depression, anger, and hostility. Evidence is growing that the spice saffron produces a drop in depression symptoms comparable to Prozac. The spice turmeric may help lessen the symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Exercise can help mitigate ADHD symptoms and combat depression. Those adhering to a strict plant-based diet should eat foods fortified with vitamin B-12 or take supplements to avoid a vitamin B-12 deficiency, which has been linked to cases of psychosis, suicidal depression, and cognitive decline.Public awareness and education related to mental health issues are of utmost importance. Many herbal products like chlorella are being marketed to promote mental health without an adequate research base.

T-1199	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury/	mercury	Mercury is a natural element that is toxic to humans at certain exposure levels. It is a neurotoxin that may affect brain function in adults, teens and infants, and a cardiac toxin that may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and fatal heart attack. Mercury may counteract the anti-inflammatory benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.Fish, including tuna, is the main food source of mercury. A 2010 study of the mercury levels in three national brands of canned tuna found that 55% of the tuna examined was above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safety level for human consumption. Eating tuna may cause enough brain damage to significantly lower intelligence.The mercury content in fish may help explain links found between fish intake and mental disorders, depression, and suicide. There may be a synergistic toxicity involving the neurotoxin BMAA, which can come from algae, and mercury in fish that raises the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and ALS. A study of California children ages two through seven showed the top food source of their exposure to mercury to be seafood. Researchers examining 33 different fish species found that for most species, the adverse effect of mercury on the children’s IQ scores exceeded the beneficial effects of DHA from the ingested fish oil. The simultaneous exposure to mercury and dioxins in fish may also increase diabetes risk, and mercury or other contaminants may help explain why men with heart disease who eat more oily fish or take fish oil capsules have a higher cardiac death risk. A future mother’s exposure to mercury from fish intake during pregnancy appears to raise the risk of the baby having a smaller brain. Due to the half-life of mercury, future mothers should consider avoiding polluted fish consumption for a year before they get pregnant. Women who eat a lot of fish should consider getting tested for mercury (via hair testing) before getting pregnant.Ayurvedic medicines may be contaminated with mercury. Other sources of mercury include factory-farmed chicken and dairy and foods containing high-fructose corn syrup. Amalgam tooth fillings and childhood vaccinations also contain small amounts of mercury. A vegetarian diet and dietary fiber may help reduce mercury levels.	-	fish,persistent organic

T-1204	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/metabolic-syndrome/	metabolic syndrome	Metabolic Syndrome is a medical disorder characterized by abdominal obesity, high fasting blood sugar levels, high triglycerides and high blood pressure – the so-called “deadly quartet”. Metabolic syndrome is estimated to afflict a quarter of the American population, and puts those suffering from it increased risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.There are many factors that may play a role in the development and maintenance of metabolic syndrome. Vegetarians have the lowest risk for metabolic syndrome, followed by semi-vegetarians, and then non-vegetarians, after controlling for lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise.Animal protein consumption is tied to metabolic syndrome, possibly due to the increase of inflammatory markers present in the blood, heme iron acting as a pro-oxidant, and environmental pollutants that are present in animal products. For example, fish consumption increases blood sugar levels, and in individuals who eat two or more servings per week of fish, the insulin producing cells in the pancreas show decreased functioning.  Persistent organic pollutants, which are found in animal products, are linked to metabolic disease and may also cause endocrine disruption. In addition, the American Heart Association advises restricted egg consumption in adults for preventing cardiometabolic disease.Consumption of artificial sweeteners such as saccharin is also related to metabolic syndrome. These products are not fully digested until the large intestine, where they impact the gut microbiome and induce glucose intolerance.Low dietary fiber intake has been linked to metabolic syndrome, heart disease, stroke, cancer, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and high blood sugar. Dietary fiber helps to get rid of excess bile, reduce inflammation, feed good gut bacteria, as well as control body weight, blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Some fiber-rich foods such as beans and lentils, produces the “second meal effect”. Essentially, gut bacteria feed on the fiber, produce beneficial compounds such as propionate which slow gastric emptying, thereby blunting the increase in blood sugar following a meal.One of the best ways to treat metabolic syndrome, and prevent prediabetes from turning into full-blown diabetes may be to reduce abdominal fat. Traditional weight loss strategies have focused on caloric restriction, but these approaches do not tend to work long-term. In one study, participants were either instructed to include 5 cups of beans into their diet per week, or to cut their calorie intake by 500 calories per week. The group that ate beans saw reductions in prediabetes risk factors that were as good as, if not better than, the calorie restriction group.Aside from eating beans, there are other dietary changes that may help with metabolic syndrome. Switching from white rice to brown may help as well, as white rice produces a decrease in arterial function in prediabetics and those with metabolic syndrome.	-	diabetes,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart health,heart disease,beans,fruit,obesity,vegetables,prediabetes,meat,blood pressure,plant-based diets,cancer,inflammation	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/29/where-do-you-get-your-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/18/dietary-cholesterol-affects-blood-cholesterol-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/04/plant-based-diets-for-metabolic-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/24/which-works-better-adding-beans-or-portion-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/23/why-would-eating-fish-increase-diabetes-risk/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/worth-switching-white-rice-brown/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-vinegar-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clinical-studies-on-acai-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-five-to-one-fiber-rule/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/debunking-egg-industry-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/metabolic-syndrome-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lentils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-loss,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/artificial-sweeteners/,http://fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/triglycerides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saccharin/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-sugar/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pancreas-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/glucose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safety-of-heme-vs-non-heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bile-acids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heme-iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prediabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/insulin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/caloric-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/abdominal-fat/

T-1208	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/metastases/	metastases	Cancer is the #2 killer in the United States, and diet may be the #1 cause of cancer (see also here, here, here). Why might doctors not know this? Because they may have never learned about it (see also here).The balance of evidence suggests that whole food, plant-based diets may help prevent (see also here, here, here, here, here, here, here), treat, slow (see also here), and even reverse cancer progression (see also here). It’s never too late to start eating healthier, as cancer risk can drop after starting a plant-based diet at any age. Some reasons why plant-based diets may be effective include lowering methionine intake (see also here and here), inhibiting angiogenesis, intercepting carcinogens, and increasing the consumption of fiber (see also here and here) and antioxidants. Populations eating diets centered around whole plant foods have lower rates of cancer. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables—at least 9 daily servings (despite flawed studies to the contrary) may boost detoxifying enzymes, lower inflammation, lower cholesterol, and make for healthier bowel movements (here too), ridding oneself of excess estrogen and cholesterol (see also here).On the other hand, meat consumption may increase the risk of cancer (especially processed meats (here, here)—something of which the meat industry is aware), increase risk of death, and decrease cancer survival (here, here). Cooking meats produce estrogenic carcinogens called heterocyclic amines (see also here). Smoked fish also contains high levels of carcinogenic compounds. Boiling meat, however, may lower exposure these toxins. Eggs and cheese may produce heterocyclic amines as well. Even inhaling the vapors from cooking meat (such as bacon see also here) or coming in contact with farm animals may pose a risk. Cholesterol found in animal products has been linked to increased breast cancer risk. Unfortunately, statin drugs (cholesterol lowering drugs) are also associated with a higher risk.Another reason meat consumption is associated with an increased cancer risk could be the Neu5Gc molecule found in meat that may be triggering inflammation. Certain tumors thrive in an inflammatory setting, so our immune system might be feeding tumor growth (see also here). Another explanation for the association of meat and cancer is insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) which has been linked to cancer based in part on studies of Laron Syndrome (a type of dwarfism). Those eating plant-based diets have less IGF-1, because the consumption of animal protein increases the levels of IGF-1. Though IGF-1 is an anabolic protein, blood levels are not associated with improved muscle mass. Soy consumption might not lower or raise the levels of IGF-1, depending on the quantity consumed (see also here). Vegans have lower levels of IGF-1 even when compared to endurance athletes. The heme iron found in the blood and muscle tissue of animal foods may also increase risk of cancer.Poultry may significantly increase one’s risk for a variety of blood cancers, perhaps due to the dioxins (which are also found in U.S. farm raised catfish), drugs, or viruses in chicken meat. Chicken meat may also contain arsenic (see also here and here) and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (especially when grilled). Poultry may increase the risk of liver, pancreatic, and penis cancer and cause warts if handled raw (see also here). Choline in eggs has been linked to increased risk of prostate cancer. Cows’ milk contains hormones (especially skim) that may promote cancer regardless of whether it’s organic or not (see also here). Dairy accelerates the aging enzyme, TOR, which may leads to a higher risk of cancer. Both meat and dairy may also contribute to melatonin suppression, which is associated with increased cancer risk.Animal protein intake may increase the risk of premature puberty due to chemical pollutants in meat, which may put children at higher risk for cancer later in life. Once one is diagnosed with cancer, cutting down on saturated animal fat may improve cancer survival. A neutropenic diet (one devoid of fresh fruit and vegetables) does not help those undergoing chemotherapy, but oatmeal lotion may help with chemotherapy induced rashes. On the other hand, soy foods contain phytoestrogens, which may help prevent premature puberty and have been shown to both help prevent breast cancer and improve breast cancer survival (see also here). Although the relationship between GMO soy and breast cancer remains under-studied.Green tea and many herbal varieties may also be protective (see also here). Among fruits, berries may be the best for cancer prevention, in part because they may help block cell-DNA damage. Organic strawberries and other fruits appear to work better than conventional (see also here, here and here). Cranberries are especially effective at fighting cancer, at least in a petri dish (see also here). See #1 Anticancer Vegetable (and the prequel Veggies vs. Cancer) for a comparison of the cancer-fighting properties of a wide array of vegetables in vitro. Broccoli might be the best vegetable for fighting breast cancer.Other foods that have been associated with anti-cancer properties in general are broccoli (here, here, here, here, here, and here), greens, Indian gooseberries (against cancer cell growth and invasion), dragon’s blood, chili peppers, nuts (especially walnuts see also here, here), coffee, cocoa, red rice, black beans and beans in general, fiber in general, black pepper, mushrooms (especially white button see also here, here), flax seeds (especially with regards to for prostate cancer and breast cancer see also here, here, here, and here), Ceylon cinnamon, apples (especially their peel), tomatoes, the seaweed nori, strawberries, black raspberries, blueberries, garlic, sweet potatoes, and small amounts of licorice. Populations eating a lot of turmeric have lower cancer rates, and turmeric has been shown to block carcinogens (especially in colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, and pancreatic cancer) and reprogram cancer cell death, and has even be used as a topical cancer treatment. Phytates in beans have also been shown to prevent, treat, and rehabilitate cancer cells in preclinical studies. Also make sure to get an hour of exercise every day (see also here), sleep 7-hours every night, and reduce one’s exposure to tanning beds, cell-phone radiation, CT scans, and dental x-rays. Meditation may also improve DNA health, preventing premature shortening of our telomeres.Vitamin C pills, folic acid, multivitamins and some other supplements including iron and lutein, homeopathy, and Ayurvedic supplements may be useless or worse. Exposures known to increase cancer risk include alcohol (see also here – although some grapes in red wine may prove beneficial), and maybe marijuana, acrylamide in crispy carbs such as French fries, betel nuts, caramel coloring, red dye No. 3, chlorhexidine found in certain mouthwashes, industrial chemical pollutants (specifically cadmium) fungal toxins sometimes found in conventional apple juice, kimchi, and yerba mate.Dr. Greger covers cancer in his full-length presentations:Uprooting the Leading Causes of DeathMore Than an Apple a Day: Combating Common DiseasesFrom Table to Able:

T-1219	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/microbiome/	microbiome	Our gut flora consists of trillions of bacteria living in our digestive tract. Its function is so important that it could be considered an organ. Recent studies analyzed the gut flora of people across multiple countries and continents and identified two enterotypes. Enterotypes correlate with our diet and can change as our diet changes. Diets rich in animal protein and saturated fat are associated with the Bacteriodes enterotype, while diets rich in healthy carbohydrates are associated with the Prevotella enterotype.When our gut bacteria process the food we ingest, by-products are created. Examples of potentially harmful by-products created in our gut from a diet rich in animal products include: hydrogen sulfide, which can be produced in the colon through putrefaction of meat and may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease; secondary bile acid, which may increase the risk for certain cancers, and Trimethylamine (TMA), a fishy smelling compound that is a by-product of choline, found in eggs, milk, liver, red meat, poultry, and fish, and may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.  Conversely, a whole-food, plant-based, high-fiber diet can have beneficial effects on our gut bacteria. Such a diet feeds bacteria that produce butyrate. Butyrate can be absorbed by our colon lining and block inflammation. Lignans from plants are converted to human lignans by our gut flora. High concentrations of lignans are associated with lower breast cancer risks. Sulforaphane, a powerful phytonutrient can also be produced by gut flora.Other advantages of having a healthy microbiome are healthy weight and estrogen suppression.	-	gut flora,fiber,meat,plant-based diets,vegetables,fruit,cancer,stroke,animal products,short-chain fatty acids,obesity,heart disease,diabetes,butyrate,heart health	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/putrefying-protein-and-toxifying-enzymes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-ph-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/microbiome-the-inside-story/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-hispanic-paradox-why-do-latinos-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/getting-starch-to-take-the-path-of-most-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-become-a-fecal-transplant-super-donor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/effect-of-sucralose-splenda-on-the-microbiome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resistant-starch-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-change-your-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prebiotics-tending-our-inner-garden/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-obesity-infectious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibacterial-toothpaste-harmful-helpful-or-harmless/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-your-gut-microbiome-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-microbiome-strike-it-rich-with-whole-grains/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-more-to-weigh-less/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-most-potent-phytoestrogen-is-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleopoo-what-we-can-learn-from-fossilized-feces/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-five-to-one-fiber-rule/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-may-plants-protect-against-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prebiotics-tending-our-inner-garden/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/choline,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-your-gut-microbiome-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-carcinogenic-bile-acid-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	
T-1225	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/	milk	The first US dietary guidelines were issued in 1980 and recommended a reduction in saturated fat intake (found primarily in dairy), which was protested by the dairy industry (see also here, here, and here). The dairy industry has sponsored groups that minimize the potential health risks of dairy, using studies designed to mislead many people into thinking saturated fat intake is not harmful (see also here). Dairy industry funding appears to have a significant effect on study outcomes.Dairy products are not only high in saturated fat, but they are low in a number of beneficial dietary components such antioxidants (see also here, here, and here); ergothioneine, an amino acid that may help protect our cells; and fiber, a nutrient that 97% of Americans are deficient in. Along with saturated fat, dairy products also contain cholesterol, trans fats (see also here), endotoxins, Neu5Gc, choline, all of which may raise the risk of inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.The hormones (see also here and here) in dairy products may not only promote acne (see also here, here and here), but also contribute to risk of premature puberty, multiple pregnancies (which are riskier to both mother and children), breast cancer, prostate cancer, other hormone-dependent cancers (see also here), declining sperm counts, excess estrogen, and heart disease.Industrial toxins (see also here, here, here, here, here, and here) in the dairy supply may in part account for the relationship between dairy intake and increased risk of cancer, Parkinson’s disease, lower testosterone levels, and obesity. Pesticides (see also here and here), antibiotics, and flame retardant chemicals can also build up in dairy fat. An analysis of the diets of California children found the top food source of lead as well as banned pesticides and dioxins to be dairy products. Intake of dairy appears linked to higher mortality rates.Overall, then, the health conditions dairy intake appears associated with is wide-ranging, including accelerated aging (see also here, here, and here), being overweight, canker sores, kidney stones (see also here), childhood asthma, constipation (see also here), diabetes (see also here, here, and here), different cancers (see also here, here, here, here), heart disease (see also here), hormonal imbalance, mucus, Parkinson’s disease (see also here), rheumatoid arthritis, rising blood pressure (see also here), skin wrinkling, sudden infant death syndrome, ulcerative colitis, bacterial vaginosis, and multiple sclerosis.  Dairy production may also adversely impact climate change.	-	dairy,protein,diabetes,type 1

T-1240	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mood/	mood	The most comprehensive controlled trial of diet and mood found that a plant-based diet significantly improved depression, anxiety, and productivity.  Another study involving two diet intake groups found that the more plant-based group showed greater improvement in mood than the other group. A study of almost 300,000 Canadians found greater fruit and vegetable intake to be associated with lower risk of depression, distress, and self-reported mood or anxiety disorders. Natural monoamine oxidase enzyme inhibitors in fruits and vegetables are one potential factor explaining the improvement in mood linked with a plant-based diet. The inclusion of plant foods with a high tryptophan to total protein ratio, such as seeds, is another possible factor.  Animal food intake appears to reduce tryptophan levels in the brain, which in turn tends to worsen moods. The lack of arachidonic acid in plants, but its presence in animal foods, may also account for why plant-based diets may help in boosting overall mood. A plant-based diet can also reduce a type of inflammation associated with depression.Athletes who undergo intense training may find that nutritional yeast after strenuous exercise may help them maintain both their energy and their overall mood. Saffron may help relieve PMS symptoms, including better regulation of mood swings. A study involving 21 Alzheimer’s disease patients found that while daily apple juice intake did not boost cognitive performance or day-to-day functioning, it did help with patients’ moods.Researchers have found that individuals with mood disorders may be particularly sensitive to the artificial sweetener, aspartame. For people sensitive to wheat, short-term exposure to gluten appears to worsen their mood by inducing feelings of depression. For those dependent on caffeine, withdrawal symptoms can include mood disturbances. The spice, nutmeg, may boost mood but also can be toxic at a dose of just two teaspoons. A national study found that fish consumption does not appear to boost people’s moods.  Due to possible serious side-effects, tryptophan supplements should not be used to try to improve mood.Sufficient water consumption and exercise can help elevate mood and reduce depression symptoms.	-	mental health,depression,animal products,anxiety,cholesterol,antioxidants,vegetarians,cardiovascular

T-1246	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mortality/	mortality	The Global Burden of Disease Study cited diet as the number one cause of death and disability in the United States. Obesity is likely the main preventable cause of premature death. Low-carb diets based on animal foods, red meat consumption, milk, and eggs appear associated with higher mortality. Having high blood levels of phosphorus, which can come from junk food and meat, is an independent predictor for mortality.  Declining kidney function, excess uric acid, and earlier puberty, each linked to higher mortality risk, can all be worsened by excess animal food intake. Inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption and not enough antioxidant-rich plant food appear to kill millions around the globe every year. Consumption of plant foods appears associated with lower mortality risk. Studies have suggested that adherence to a Mediterranean diet, which has less meat than the standard diet, is associated with a significant reduction of mortality risk. Studies have shown that more fruit, more greens, more polyphynol phytonutrients from plant food, more nuts, and less salt are associated with a significantly lower risk of dying. Specific foods that studies have associated with longevity are legumes, flax seed, and coffee. One analysis concluded that mortality from all causes put together is significantly lower in those eating meat-free diets.A national effort in Finland to reduce saturated fat intake from animal foods helped reduce the all-cause mortality rate by 45%. Eliminating partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply could prevent thousands of deaths every year. Meal preparation may be a factor: a 10-year study showed those who cooked at home most frequently had 59% of the mortality risk.Most foodborne illness related deaths are attributed to poultry. A major 2012 study found that multivitamin intake had no effect on mortality rates. In fact, Vitamin E supplements specifically appear to increase all-cause mortality. Sufficient Vitamin D intake from the sun or from Vitamin D supplements may help lower mortality risk.Physical inactivity ranks fifth as a risk factor for death. Daily time spent sitting appears linked with total mortality, regardless of formal exercise level. Research suggests that both not enough and too much sleep are associated with increased mortality, with about seven hours being best for lifespan.A 2011 analysis showed that while Americans are living longer, we also are living fewer healthy years than we used to. Adding deaths from medication side effects to those from staff errors, unnecessary surgeries, medical facility-sourced infections, and other health care-related fatalities shows the U.S. medical

T-1256	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/multivitamins/	multivitamins	Mother Nature probably won’t fit in a pill anytime soon. Multivitamin use does not appear to offer any longevity benefit and is associated with increased risk of breast and prostate cancer.  A meta-analysis on multivitamin and mineral supplements found no evidence that supplements affected CVD, cancer, or all causes of mortality in individuals without nutritional deficiencies. Some have speculated that copper in multivitamins may be contributing to the Alzheimer’s epidemic. Vitamin E, Vitamin A, and Beta Carotene supplements may increase mortality rates and antioxidant supplementation failed to lower the incidence of many age related disorders. Mega dosing antioxidant supplements is not a good substitute for antioxidant rich plant foods. Lutein is similarly better obtained from produce, not pills, despite the minor decline in the nutrient content of crops. A minimum of nine servings per day of fruits and vegetables is recommended over taking multivitamin supplements. Eating a combination of polynutrients found in real food was shown to reduce the DNA damage caused by IR (Ionizing Radiation) while supplements failed to show the same results. Taking Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 supplements, however, are recommended for those at risk for deficiency.	-	supplements,fruit,vegetables,heart disease,antioxidants,cardiovascular disease,mortality,cancer,heart health,chronic diseases,stroke,nuts,DNA damage,aging,cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/09/food-antioxidants-stroke-and-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/26/are-multivitamins-just-a-waste-of-money/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/07/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/26/breast-cancer-and-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-supplements-worth-taking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iodine-supplements-before-during-and-after-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/crop-nutrient-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-vitamin-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-stroke-and-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reductionism-deficiency-mentality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-multivitamins-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/multivitamin-supplements-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-a-multivitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-multivitamins-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-stroke-and-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/crop-nutrient-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vitamin-supplements-worth-taking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/multivitamin-supplements-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-a-multivitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/	
T-1261	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mushrooms/	mushrooms	Mushrooms can play a role in a dietary cognitive portfolio (one mushroom—the bay bolete—even contains theanine, the relaxant phytonutrient in green tea). Surprisingly, plain white mushrooms—the cheapest and most widely available variety—may work best and are among the most antioxidant rich. In fact, eating just plain white button mushrooms have been shown to upregulate IgA antibody secretion, and when eaten daily, may suppress breast cancer growth by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.  People suffering from autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergies, overactive immune systems, and chronic inflammation may especially benefit from eating mushrooms. Mushrooms contain compounds called beta glucans, which may boost immune function. Sun-dried or U- irradiated mushrooms also contain vitamin D2, the same type of Vitamin D doctors usually prescribe for deficiency. Another rare compound not found in most foods, the amino acid L-ergothioneine—shown to protect cells against oxidative stress—is present in mushrooms. Though mushrooms tend to be free of E. coli. raw mushrooms may contain a naturally-occurring toxin called agaritine that is deactivated by heat, so mushrooms should be eaten cooked.	-	meat,inflammation,animal products,cancer,mortality,vegans,fish,plant-based diets,vegetarians,smoking,beans,immune function,side effects,brain disease,vegetables	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/24/mushrooms-and-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/11/why-less-breast-cancer-in-asia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/06/the-best-foods-test-your-nutrition-knowledge/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/03/how-animal-proteins-may-trigger-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/08/how-to-treat-gout-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/25/how-a-tick-bite-can-lead-to-food-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/01/vitamin-d-from-mushrooms-sun-or-supplements/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-prevention-which-mushroom-is-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alpha-gal-and-the-lone-star-tick/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-vs-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-vitamin-d3-better-than-d2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gout-treatment-with-a-cherry-on-top/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/will-you-live-longer-if-you-take-vitamin-d-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-raw-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/making-our-arteries-less-sticky/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ergothioneine-a-new-vitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-vitamin-d3-better-than-d2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-best-mushroom-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-raw-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/toxins-in-raw-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-d/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-vs-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ergothioneine-a-new-vitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/breast-cancer-prevention-which-mushroom-is-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/green-tea	
T-1288	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/natural-toxins/	natural toxins	Foodborne illness can result from contamination by fecal bacteria or persistent organic pollutants, as well as the presence of natural toxins. As they decompose, seafood and meats can develop toxins that can sicken us before the spoilage is apparent. Other foods and supplements to be cautious about because of potential toxicity include betel nuts, star fruit, mangosteen juice, yerba mate (see here and here), iron pills, cod liver oil, noni juice, blue-green algae, and spirulina (see also here). Kimchee may also be a problem, though avocados (see also here) have been largely exonerated. We can reduce possible exposure to patulin, a fungus-produced mycotoxin that can affect apples, by cutting away brown parts in apples, and, if we’re going to drink any apple juice, choosing organic. And while sweet potatoes are a health-promoting superfood, white potatoes contain natural glycoalkaloid toxins, though peeling the skin removes about 75% of them. Raw mushrooms also contain natural toxins, but they are removed through cooking. Because of its coumarin content, which can be toxic to the liver, Chinese cinnamon, also known as cassia cinnamon, should be avoided. Ceylon cinnamon is considered safe for regular intake.	-	cancer,liver health,nutrition myths,safety limits,liver disease,supplements,persin,hepatotoxins,heart disease,heart health,breast cancer,DNA damage,avocados,women's health,carcinogens	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/29/toxin-contamination-of-spirulina-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/24/is-noni-or-mangosteen-juice-safe/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-betel-nuts-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-corpse-smell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-yerba-mate-tea-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-kimchi-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-raw-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safety-of-noni-and-mangosteen-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-mangosteen-juice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-yerba-mate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-star-fruit-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-cooked-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fungal-toxins-in-apples/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-iron-pills-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-cod-liver-oil-good-for-you/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-star-fruit-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-mangosteen-juice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-yerba-mate-tea-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=contamination,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/toxins-in-raw-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-yerba-mate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-iron-pills-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safety-of-noni-and-mangosteen-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=fecal+bacteria,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/toxins-in-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-cod-liver-oil-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-spirulina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=persistent+organic+pollutants,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-betel-nuts-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-kimchi-good-for-you/comment-page-1/#comment-2239,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/new-corpse-smell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fungal-toxins-in-apples/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/toxins-in-cooked-potatoes/	
T-1293	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nerve-health/	nerve health	Poor nerve health can result in pain and/or loss of muscle control. What we eat can be a factor in our nerveous system health. Blue-green algae and spirulina can contain neurotoxins that should be avoided. Drug and chemical residues that may be in the meat supply can, among a number of potential negative effects, damage nerves. Essential tremor, a common neurological condition, has been linked to such compounds. Mercury in canned tuna can damage a person’s nervous system regardless of age (see also here). Arsenic, primarily found in chicken in the American diet, has been linked to public health issues such as neuropathy and neurocognitive deficits in children. The most common cause of flaccid paralysis in the US comes from eating chicken. Regular intake of the standard American diet, may lead to lower back pain.On the other hand, eating greens may help boost heart nerve control. Apple juice and ginger have been found to protective of nerve cells in vitro. Indian gooseberries have also been found to help protect nerves. Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the body attacks its own nerves. A plant-based diet developed by the late Dr. Roy Swank that minimizes saturated fat may be safest and most effective treatment for MS patients.	-	brain health,brain disease,vegetarians,vegans,mental health,Alzheimer’s disease,pain,heart health,cholesterol,children,plant-based diets,heart disease,cognition,infants,pregnancy	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/11/preventing-and-treating-low-back-pain-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/29/toxin-contamination-of-spirulina-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/08/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-help-reduce-brain-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-heart-nerve-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetarians-myelopathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inverted-rabbit-sign/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-in-circulation-sciatica-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-prevent-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegan-paralysis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-vitamin-b12-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-brand-of-tuna-has-the-most-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-fog/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-heart-nerve-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-in-circulation-sciatica-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-brand-of-tuna-has-the-most-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/

The USDA has failed to safeguard the meat supply from drug residues, which may also be neurotoxic. Men who consume large quantities of meat may have an increased risk of getting muscle tremors due to the levels of cooked meat carcinogens known as heterocyclic amines. Vegetarian’s Myelopathy refers to vitamin B12 deficiency. This can have potentially severe neurological consequences, such as spinal cord degeneration and paralysis. Those eating plant-based diets must ensure a regular, reliable source of vitamin B12.

Neurotoxins in meat and fish may be contributing to brain damage (including memory loss and dementia) as well as muscle tremors, and the effects of consuming contaminated fish may last for decades.  Neurotoxins found in chicken may be linked to hand tremors, the most common movement disorder. The neurotoxin, BMAA, found in seafood may be linked to ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease).	-	brain health,brain disease,Parkinson's disease,fish,Alzheimer’s disease,vegans,meat,milk,seafood,vegetarians,pork,plant-based diets,persistent organic pollutants,chicken,poultry	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/22/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-and-fish-food-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/21/foods-linked-to-als/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amnesic-seafood-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-fog/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-spirulina-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ciguatera-poisoning-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/get-the-lead-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amnesic-seafood-poisoning/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/maternal-mercury-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mercury-in-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-spirulina-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/does-tofu-cause-dementia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ciguatera-poisoning-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/fish-fog/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/arsenic-in-chicken/	
T-1323	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nutrient-absorption/	nutrient absorption	It’s not what we eat, but what we absorb. That’s why experiments showing that the sulforaphane from broccoli and broccoli sprouts can make it into breast tissue it critical for explaining how crucifers may help with breast cancer protection.Too much nutrient absorption can sometimes be a problem though. Meeting iron needs through plant-based foods (non-heme iron) may help reduce excess iron risk (see also here). Avoiding too much iron absorption from supplements is especially important for non-anemic, pregnant women.The allium vegetables, which include garlic and onions, may help us absorb minerals. Eating flax could also help nourish our good bacteria that in turn can aid with phytonutrient absorption. Dressings or toppings with healthy fats from nuts or seeds can help maximize phytonutrient absorption when we eat a salad.Nutrient absorption may differ among foods. For example, calcium from broccoli and kale may be absorbed almost twice as well as calcium from milk.Most people cannot absorb more than 1.5 micrograms of Vitamin B12 before the body can take more four to six hours later. The body absorbs B12 in such a way that the most cost-effective way to take B12 may be through one 2500 microgram sublingual, chewable, or liquid supplement of cyanocobalamin once a week. It may be better for your health to take the B12 from a supplement or fortified food instead of an animal source.Phytosterols, which may help reduce cholesterol, are better absorbed through seeds and nuts than supplements or phytosterol-fortified spreads and beverages. Phytosterol intake does not reduce food vitamin absorption.Anyone predisposed to oxalate absorption may want to avoid beets, which have high oxalate levels, as a plant-based nitrate source. Two spices with potential benefits are turmeric and cinnamon, but because of the soluble oxalate that can be absorbed, turmeric intake should be no more than one teaspoon per day. Since the oxalate in cinnamon is not as easily absorbed, most people can probably take up to a few teaspoons a day.Macronutrient absorption of certain foods may also influence satiety. A study showed the fat absorption from walnuts to be filling enough to possibly help with daily overall calorie reduction. Research suggests that adding nuts and nut butters to one’s diet doesn’t lead to significant weight gain.To maximize Vitamin D absorption, researchers have suggested that Vitamin D supplements are best taken with the largest meal of the day.If you drink calcium-fortified soymilk, shaking the container before you drink the soymilk helps you optimize calcium absorption. Some phytonutrients are better absorbed if the plant foods are cooked rather than raw, and vice-versa. So, to best benefit your health, consider eating both raw and cooked plant foods (see also here).	-	nuts,phytonutrients,fat,cholesterol,heart disease,seeds,heart health,cardiovascular disease,weight loss,calories,phytosterols,obesity,cardiovascular health,fiber,pistachios	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/12/anti-cancer-nutrient-synergy-in-cranberries/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sulforaphane-from-broccoli-to-breast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/daily-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-veggies-versus-cooked-for-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iron-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-source/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-fruit-whose-juice-is-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-phytosterols-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-iron-pills-good-for-you/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sulforaphane-from-broccoli-to-breast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iron-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/daily-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-source/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-phytosterols-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asparagus-pee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-iron-pills-good-for-you/	
T-1326	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nutrition-myths/	nutrition myths	There are many myths surrounding nutrition, often reinforced by a lack of nutrition education in medical schools, resulting in some doctors’ lack of adequate information on the subject. Despite myths to the contrary, the following appear to be beneficial: lots of fruits and vegetables (see here, here), plant-based diets, protein (which is not bad for bones), soy (even for women on Tamoxifen; it also produces positive effects on cognition and has no negative effects on male fertility), coffee, tea made with cold water, cooking vegetables (especially in the microwave), gluten (for 132 out of every 133 people), fatty (plant-derived) dressing, chlorella, some plant enzymes, alkaline water (but not alkaline water machines), various cholesterol-lowering foods, and maintaining very low cholesterol levels. At the same time questions have been raised about red yeast rice supplements. Despite myths regarding the dangers or purported benefits of the following, they do not appear to be either: homeopathy, stevia, MSG (despite alleged allergic reactions), vitamin C supplements, citric acid, crop nutrient decline and moderate alcohol consumption in healthy people. Pomegranate juice is probably not as good as advertised (is anything?). Finally, despite myths claiming no danger or even benefits from the following, these may to be harmful: eggs, fish, fish oil (due to DDT and other industrial pollutants – this includes distilled cod liver oil), meat due to arachidonic acid, deep-frying foods, having ‘average’ cholesterol levels (see here, here), low stool weight and size, a pure raw food diet, B12 deficiency present in non-supplementing vegans as well as their babies (up to 20% of them), too little iodine, too much iodine, avocados, raw alfalfa sprouts, non-organic apple juice, artificial colorings (especially ones derived from insects), aspartame, some types of Ayurvedic medicine (see here, here), blue-green algae supplements, iron pills, spirulina supplements (for their neurotoxins and liver toxins), multivitamin supplements, vitamin E supplements, Herbalife (for its liver toxicity, possibly due to vitamin A), mangosteen juice, Juice Plus+ (which is really just another vitamin supplement), high fructose corn syrup, kimchi, kombucha tea, noni juice, and yerba mate.	-	heart disease,cardiovascular disease,cholesterol,heart health,vegetables,cardiovascular health,plant-based

T-1329	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts/	nuts	Nuts and nut butters represent a healthy food choice; they are not only delicious but may offer a range of health benefits.Specific nuts appear to protect against DNA damage, suppress cancer growth and inflammation, reduce cholesterol, improve arterial function and reduce the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms and heart disease. Just a few servings a week may even extend our lifespan.Studies have shown nuts don’t contribute to weight gain and may actually facilitate weight loss. A variety of studies adding nuts to people’s diets led to no weight gain at all.Nuts are a preferred source of protein in a plant-based diet. Nuts and seeds offer a healthy source of fat, which can boost the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. Nuts are also an excellent source of minerals (especially dry roasted) and Vitamin E.Their antioxidant content puts nuts as a group near the top of the list of healthy foods. Keep in mind the nut group does not include betel nuts (which have been shown to be carcinogenic and damaging to liver and kidneys), nor necessarily chestnuts or coconuts. Coconut oil and coconut milk appear to raise one’s LDL (bad cholesterol) as much as butter.The dietary guidelines of countries such as Greece recommend nuts as snacks. The 2010 USDA Guidelines and MyPlate recommendations similarly emphasize a shift toward a more plant-based diet that includes nuts.Topic summary contributed by Aaron.	-	fruit,vegetables,plant-based diets,grains,aging,cancer,beans,vegans,supplements,elderly,seeds,fiber,vegetarians,dairy,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/23/the-five-most-important-dietary-tweaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/14/how-much-fiber-should-you-eat-every-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/03/whats-the-mediterranean-diets-secret/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/24/reduce-saturated-fat-intake-to-protect-your-pancreas/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lose-two-pounds-one-sitting-taking-mioscenic-route/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-diabetes-with-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/predimed-does-eating-nuts-prevent-strokes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-brown-fat-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/getting-starch-to-take-the-path-of-most-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/walnuts-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-the-fiber-theory-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-the-risk-of-sudden-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-to-reduce-stroke-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/four-nuts-once-a-month/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-chocolate-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediterranean-diet-and-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-more-to-weigh-less/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-e,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol	
T-1333	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/	obesity	The Mayo Clinic defines obesity, a common U.S. condition, as having an excessive amount of body fat. The U.S. National Institute of Health defines obesity as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more. One in three American adults is obese, seven times the rate of China and eight times more than Japan. If the current trend continues, virtually 100% of Americans will be obese by the end of the century.The annual cost attributable to obesity among full-time U.S. employees is estimated at $70 billion.  Obesity is associated with serious health problems including heart disease, diabetes, heart attack, prostate enlargement, reduced female fertilization rates, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cancer.  Obesity can both stress a person’s joints and degrade a person’s cartilage.  A form of low-grade systemic inflammation called metaflammation is associated with obesity.The U.S. obesity epidemic extends to children. Only 1 in 1000 American children eats a healthy diet, a likely cause of the childhood obesity epidemic and the dramatic rise in childhood diabetes. The availability of large portions of junk food appears to be linked to this obesity trend. Babies who are fed milk formula have a higher obesity rate than babies who are breastfed.The food industry has helped promulgate the erroneous message that inactivity, rather than consumption of manufactured, calorie-rich, nutrient-poor foods, is the prime cause of obesity.  Food and beverage intake along with calorie overconsumption are actually more important than physical activity in weight maintenance and loss. Intake of chicken meat, which has over ten times the calories and fat of chickens a hundred years ago, may contribute to obesity risk. Consumption of milk, refined grains, meat, and fish contaminated with industrial pollutants may also raise obesity risk. Dairy, meat, eggs, and junk foods all raise the activity of the TOR enzyme, which appears to be linked to obesity risk. Industrial pollutants that may build up in our body fat from diet may help explain the link between obesity and diabetes.  Endocrine-disrupting chemicals in foods and increased uric acid levels from meat and sugar intake may increase obesity risk. Not getting a good night’s sleep is another potential risk factor.  A review of common slimming supplements showed that they were not effective for weight loss.A plant-based diet can help prevent and treat obesity and other serious health conditions. Plant-based diets appear to protect against metabolic syndrome and may foster the kinds of gut bacteria linked to reduced obesity risk.  Breastfeeding infants may help protect them against subsequent obesity for over 30 years. Green tea, beans, whole grains, and fiber from various sources may also help lower obesity risk.  Fiber-consuming bacteria in the gut create the compounds propionate and butyrate, which appear to have an anti-obesity effect. Research has associated nut and dried fruit intake with lower obesity risk. 	-	hormones,diabetes,heart health,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,prediabetes,heart disease,plant-based

T-1339	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oils/	oils	Eating a plant-based diet low in fat and high in carbohydrates may improve mood and relieve symptoms of depression, possibly due to the reduced consumption of arachidonic acid, an omega 6 fatty acid found in chicken and eggs thought to cause inflammation in the brain. High fat meals have been shown to decrease the body’s ability to vasodilate coronary arteries and reduce blood flow. This can induce chest pain in people with known coronary artery disease. Extra virgin olive oil may not impair arterial function as much as regular olive oil, and contain be anti-inflammatory phytonutrients.Whole food sources of fat found in nuts and seeds may be even better at lowering bad cholesterol than extra virgin olive oil. Oils can become rancid, but the true shelf-life of cooking oils does not seem to correlate to the expiration date and it is recommended to store in a dark, airtight environment to maximize shelf life.Deep-fried foods have been associated with an increase in cancer risk due to carcinogens formed at high cooking temperatures. Worse yet, these particles become airborne and create dangerous secondhand smoke. Canola oil may generate the least amount of toxic fumes while coconut oil may be the worst. Trans Fat is found naturally in animal foods, however, the food industry synthetically derives them from vegetable oil in a process known as hydrogenation in order to increase shelf life. A food that promises to be trans-fat free may in fact contain up to 0.5 grams of partially hydrogenated oils, so make sure to check the ingredient list when shopping.	-	plant-based diets,meat,vegetarians,dairy,vegans,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,grains,eggs,aging,beans,standard American diet,elderly	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/05/tarragon-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/05/the-reversal-on-fish-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/12/how-to-get-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil-vs-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vinegar-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-diabetes-with-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-true-shelf-life-of-cooking-oils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-dha-supplements-to-boost-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-reversal-is-it-the-calories-or-the-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/curing-painful-diabetic-neuropathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-compared-cigarette-smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diet-studies-show-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fatty-meals-may-impair-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediterranean-diet-and-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthy-food-movement-strength-in-unity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil-vs-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fatty-meals-may-impair-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carcinogens,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mood,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-true-shelf-life-of-cooking-oils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/	
T-1343	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/olive-oil/	olive oil	There are plenty of mixed feelings about olive oil. Is it good for me? What are the benefits? Is it better than other oils? Should I consume it regularly?Olive oil was found to have the same impairment to endothelial function, a predictor of heart disease, as high-fat fast food meals. Extra virgin olive oil has more of a neutral effect on artery function—it neither helps nor hinders artery function—but neither regular olive oil nor extra-virgin olive oil were found to significantly reduce heart attack rates.Some studies suggest endothelial function improves on a Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive oil, but perhaps that’s because the diet is also rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and walnuts: dietary fruits and vegetables appear to provide some protection against the direct impairment of endothelial function produced by high-fat foods, including olive oil.If you are going to consume olive oil, choose extra virgin olive oil.  Extra virgin olive oil retains a fraction of the anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found in the olive fruit and doesn’t appear to induce the spike in inflammatory markers caused by regular olive oil.Instead of turning to oils for your healthy fats, turn to nuts! Eating nuts may lower total cholesterol and may delay the progression of atherosclerosis, the harbinger of future cardiovascular events such as stroke. Remember, whole food is best—whole food sources of plant fat, such as nuts, actually improve artery function, whereas oils, including olive oil, worsen artery function.Olive oil, along with vegetables, beans, peas, lentils, and soy, appears to be protective against skin wrinkling.	-	heart disease,cardiovascular disease,nuts,Mediterranean diet,fruit,mortality,dairy,meat,plant-based diets,walnuts,vegetables,PREDIMED,heart health,cardiovascular health,alcohol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/27/trans-fat-in-animal-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/13/how-walnuts-can-improve-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mediterranean-diet-or-a-whole-food-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/walnuts-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beauty-is-more-than-skin-deep/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil-vs-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vinegar-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediterranean-diet-and-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/deep-frying-toxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/predimed-does-eating-nuts-prevent-strokes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-parts-of-the-mediterranean-diet-extended-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/mediterranean-diet,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/walnuts,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/whole-grains,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans	
T-1345	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omega-3-fatty-acids/	omega-3 fatty acids	The health benefits that are believed to be associated with Omega-3 fatty acid intake include: decreased inflammation, help for arthritis, and reduced symptoms of depression. Omega-3 may even boost health and intelligence of unborn babies, though the mercury in fish significantly decreases IQ. While often a recommended source of omega-3, fish and fish-oil supplements may not be harmless due to the presence of dioxins, PCBs, mercury, and other industrial pollutants. These pollutants in fish may increase our risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiac death. Other animal products such as chicken are no longer a bountiful source of omega-3 due to genetic manipulation. Omega-3 enriched eggs can be a source, but eggs contain cholesterol and arachidonic acid. Two plant-based sources sources of omega-3 are flax seeds and algae-based DHA supplements, which are bioequivalent to fish oil but do not have the harmful industrial toxins.	-	fish,cardiovascular

An omnivorous diet also appears to increase the risk of abdominal fat, higher BMI, obesity, unhealthy stools, and accelerated aging.Many clinical trials have compared omnivores to those eating plant-based diets. On average, those eating a plant-based diet may be deficient in three nutrients, whereas omnivores tend to be deficient in seven. Vegans have been found to have more acid erosion in their teeth compared to omnivores, though research indicates there are no significant differences in plaque, gingivitis, or cavities. The bone density of those eating a plant-based diet has been found to be equal to that of omnivores. Those eating strictly plant-based diets appear to have significantly more alkaline urine than omnivores, which helps remove uric acid from the body.Other studies have found that individuals who switched from an omnivorous to a vegetarian diet had lower toxic metal levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury in their bodies. Children eating a plant-based diet were found to have the highest IQs, with those eating vegetarian ranking second, and omnivorous eaters at third. Omnivores apparently have a higher level of carcinogenic industrial toxins and pesticides in their bodies than vegans do. A diet with animal foods likely means a higher ingestion of arachidonic acid, which in turn may account for higher reported mood scores by vegetarians compared to omnivores. A comparison study between vegans and omnivores found that vegans had better blood sugar and insulin levels.	-	vegetarians,vegans,plant-based diets,meat,heart disease,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,heart health,vegetables,eggs,dairy,fruit,cancer,fiber,mortality	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/29/where-do-you-get-your-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/15/how-to-reduce-your-dietary-cadmium-absorption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/29/bowel-movements-the-scoop-on-poop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/24/reduce-saturated-fat-intake-to-protect-your-pancreas/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/18/the-vitamin-everyone-on-a-plant-based-diet-needs/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/daily-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-sex-hormone-binding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lipotoxicity-how-saturated-fat-raises-blood-sugar/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heterocyclic-amines-in-eggs-cheese-and-creatine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animalistic-plant-proteins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-intake-and-igf-1-production/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegan-protein-status/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetarians-versus-healthy-omnivores/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/creatine-brain-fuel-supplementation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fiber-vs-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/milk-protein-vs-soy-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetarians,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-sex-hormone-binding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cadmium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lipotoxicity-how-saturated-fat-raises-blood-sugar/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lead,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetarians-versus-healthy-omnivores/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/milk-protein-vs-soy-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/	
T-1347	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/onions/	onions	When it comes to eating nutritious foods that may play a role in cancer prevention, studies have shown the two best vegetable families for preventing cancers include cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli, kale, cauliflower and cabbage), and alliums (including garlic, onions and leeks). Both types of vegetables provide a host of benefits and can aid in preventing diseases.Natural plant-derived compounds found in onions, along with broccoli, green tea and strawberries, can suppress the “engine-of-aging” enzyme Target of Rapamycin (TOR), the enzyme that regulates cellular growth and proliferation in the human body. Higher TOR expression has been seen in breast cancer tumors.Onions and garlic possess powerful anti-blood clotting qualities when consumed raw, for example, chopped in salads or salsas, or as an ingredient in baba ghanoush, an eggplant dip. This is good news for those concerned about their risk of heart attack or stroke.People are continuously exposed to a wide range of dioxins in cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes, cooked meat and fish, and dairy products.  More than 90% of the dioxins we absorb are absorbed through diet. Fortunately, phytonutrients in fruits, vegetables, tea, red wine and beans block the effects of dioxins. Just a tablespoon of raw red onion daily may cut dioxin toxicity in half. But to maintain the beneficial effects of these immune-stimulating properties, we need to continue eating foods containing these phytonutrients every day.Onions also contain phytonutrients that may inhibit monoamine oxidase—an enzyme that has been linked to depression.Many vegetables lose some antioxidant content when cooked. One study of 20 vegetables determined the worst cooking method to preserve antioxidants is boiling, followed by pressure cooking, baking and frying. The gentlest cooking method is microwaving, which preserves 97.3% of the antioxidants. Interestingly, artichokes, beets and onions weren’t affected by cooking at all.	-	vegetables,fruit,cancer,garlic,grapes,antioxidants,dairy,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,berries,tomatoes,broccoli,cholesterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/27/can-we-fight-the-blues-with-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/05/how-to-suppress-the-aging-enzyme-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/09/what-to-eat-to-reduce-our-toxic-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/05/treating-an-enlarged-prostate-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/06/the-best-foods-test-your-nutrition-knowledge/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/26/breast-cancer-and-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-the-blues-with-greens-mao-inhibitors-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-and-onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carrots-vs-baby-carrots-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-miso-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-interrupted-garlic-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-cancer-from-going-on-tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/shaking-salt-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-clots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/microwaving/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/	
T-1349	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oral-cancer/	oral cancer	Oral cancer is one of the ten most common cancers, with a death rate around 50%. Diet and lifestyle may significantly affect one’s vulnerability to oral cancer. If you manage your weight, eat more plant foods, fewer animal foods, and less alcohol—and, if you’re a breastfeeding woman, you may significantly lower your risk of oral cancer.The foods found most protective against oral cancer include raw and green/leafy vegetables, apples, tomatoes, citrus, and carrots. Oral cancer lesions appear to respond well to black raspberries and turmeric. Deep-fried foods, such as French fries, may contain acrylamide, which has been associated with oral and other cancers.	-	cancer,women's health,vegans,plant-based diets,vegetarians,breast cancer,oral health,fruit,smoking,vegetables,alcohol,cancer survival,poultry,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/27/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/27/dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/12/anti-cancer-nutrient-synergy-in-cranberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/19/black-raspberries-may-help-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/25/do-vegans-get-more-cavities/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-avocados-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-alcohol-what-much-is-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/frying/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/acrylamide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apples/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breastfeeding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/black-raspberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/weight-loss,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alcohol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tomatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/carrots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/	
T-1350	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oral-health/	oral health	Plant-based diets may help prevent oral cancer as well as gum disease. Fruits and vegetables contain a vast variety of phytonutrients that promote oral health.  For example, an apple a day has been linked with less oral cancer. The consumption of black raspberries may result in the regression of precancerous lesions in the mouth.   Cranberries have anti-proliferative effects on cancer in vitro. Within just a few weeks of eating a healthier diet, our taste buds may adjust so that healthier foods may begin to taste better. For those eating a plant-based diet, vitamin B12 supplementation is essential for oral health.Although the consumption of citrus and sour fruits may promote the erosion of tooth enamel, rinsing with water after consuming acidic foods appears to be a good preventive measure. Swishing with water may also protect tooth enamel from the natural acids found in beverages such as hibiscus tea. Rinsing with green tea may help prevent the growth of plaque bacteria without the genetic damage associated with chlorhexidine antiseptic mouthwashes. Yet children should be careful to limit their tea drinking, as the overconsumption of green tea during childhood may increase risk of dental fluorosis– or discoloration- due to its natural fluoride content. The antioxidants from lemonbalm tea may be protective against radiation-induced oxidative stress.Gargling is known to soothe sore throats, but in addition, gargling may reduce the risk of the common cold. Oral lichen planus, where the immune system starts attacking the lining of the mouth, has been successfully treated with the common plant, purslane. Amalgam fillings in our teeth contain mercury and release a certain amount every day; eating just a single can of tuna a week, though, may be the equivalent to having 29 fillings in your mouth. Bioaccumulation leads to the contamination of dairy and meat products with persistent organic pollutants, which may be linked to gum disease.  Research reveals that cow’s milk may also be linked to recurring canker sores.  Poultry workers have been found to have excess cancers of the mouth and other body parts.  For accessible cancers such as those of the mouth, the curcumin in turmeric may be topically applied to offer relief from the itching and oozing of recurrent, ulcerative lesions.	-	dental health,tea,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,plant-based diets,vegetables,cardiovascular health,heart health,cancer,colon cancer,mouthwash,DNA damage,vegans,fruit,antioxidants	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/27/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/06/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/21/making-your-own-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/06/how-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/19/how-eggs-can-impact-body-odor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/25/do-vegans-get-more-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/18/are-dental-x-rays-safe/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-raisins-cause-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-lichen-planus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/migratory-skin-worms-from-sushi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-our-taste-buds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inverted-rabbit-sign/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-green-tea-help-treat-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-downside-of-green-smoothies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-choline-something-fishy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/club-soda-for-stomach-pain-and-constipation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibacterial-toothpaste-harmful-helpful-or-harmless/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-alcohol-what-much-is-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apthous-ulcer-mystery-solved/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wart-cancer-virusesin-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-lichen-planus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bioaccumulation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-our-taste-buds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inverted-rabbit-sign/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/water,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oxidative-stress,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apthous-ulcer-mystery-solved/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wart-cancer-virusesin-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	
T-1352	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/orange-juice/	orange juice	Citrus-based fruits such as oranges contain hesperidin, which may increase circulation and help decrease risk of stroke. In addition, orange concentrates are one of the top five sources of potassium, and potassium-rich foods may help prevent vascular diseases such as stroke. Drinking orange juice, however, is different than eating oranges. Although fruits and vegetables may reduce the inflammatory effect mediated by platelets, orange juice or grapefruit juice failed to produce these benefits.  Phytosterol-fortified orange juice consumption may not be as effective in boosting dietary phytosterols as with nut and seed consumption, as increased phytosterol absorption occurs in the presence of fat. Due to the presence of zeaxanthins, just a couple of oranges a week—but not orange juice—may lower risk of glaucoma.  To protect our teeth and prevent erosion of our enamel after we eat citrus or drink orange juice, we should swish our mouths with water to clear the acid from our teeth.Orange juice does have its benefits. For example, if we drink sugar water this leads to oxidative damage; yet if we drink the same amount of sugar in the form of orange juice, the antioxidants help buffer against the spike in oxidative damage. Also, fruit juices such as orange juice contain phenolics, which may provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease. The carbohydrates in orange juice may cause a release of insulin that results in an increase in brain tryptophan levels.	-	fruit,phytonutrients,vegetables,fruit juice,citrus,oranges,heart disease,heart health,mortality,juice,cancer,vitamin C,supplements,antioxidants,carrots	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/02/the-reason-we-need-more-antioxidants-and-why-were-not-getting-them/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/06/the-best-foods-test-your-nutrition-knowledge/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/02/the-number-one-global-diet-risk/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-airplane-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-hibiscus-tea-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/citrus-peels-cancer-zest-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-aggregation-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-and-benefits-of-sensible-sun-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-source/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-vitamin-d-the-new-vitamin-e/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/potassium,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nut,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oranges,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/zeaxanthins,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-aggregation-with-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-source/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protecting-teeth-from-hibiscus-tea/

The consumption of sugar paired with naturally occurring antioxidants may even reduce the oxidative damage of eating sugar straight up, but one should rinse with water to neutralize the acid and postpone teeth brushing for at least thirty to sixty minutes, as research demonstrates that the consumption of citrus and sour fruit may soften enamel.	-	fruit,phytonutrients,vitamin C,antioxidants,cancer,lemons,vegetables,bananas,orange juice,citrus,fruit juice,apples,fat,colon cancer,broccoli	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/06/citrus-to-reduce-muscle-fatigue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/21/the-real-paleo-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/31/does-orange-aromatherapy-reduce-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/10/which-common-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/02/the-reason-we-need-more-antioxidants-and-why-were-not-getting-them/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-skin-cancer-from-the-inside-out/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruits-vegetables-boost-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-noni-juice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/greens-vs-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/anxiety,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/aromatherapy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/

Organ meats also tend to be high in heavy metals, as well as the amino acid ergothioneine.In the ongoing quest to determine the cause of Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have noted that victims of the disease have higher levels of copper in their blood, in their brain, and in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding their brain.Metals like iron and copper are strongly concentrated within the plaques and tangles that are the hallmark of the Alzheimer’s brain, and organ meats and shellfish are the richest food sources of copper. (Copper and iron are also often found in multi-vitamin supplements.)Cadmium is another highly toxic metal that remains in the body for years, because our bodies have no efficient way to dispose of it. Cadmium may contribute to a range of diseases, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes. One Long Island study indicated that roughly 40% of breast cancers in the nation may be associated with elevated cadmium levels.The highest levels of cadmium are found in organ meats, though cigarette smoke and seafood consumption are other primary sources. Because organ meats make up a relatively small portion of most people’s diets, grains and vegetables actually end up contributing the largest amount. Yet, cadmium absorption from plant-based foods may be much lower than cadmium bioavailability in animal products.Organ meats can be the culprit in gout, a form of arthritis made painful by needle-sharp crystals of uric acid in the joints, which comes from the breakdown of purines. While there’s no such thing as a purine-free diet, high-purine foods include meat—especially organ meats. 	-	meat,vegetables,animal products,fish,grains,plant-based diets,mushrooms,fruit,protein,antioxidants,cancer,seafood,beans,inflammation,side effects	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/15/how-to-reduce-your-dietary-cadmium-absorption/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/03/how-animal-proteins-may-trigger-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/19/how-to-get-parents-to-eat-their-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/08/how-to-treat-gout-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/06/which-are-more-anti-inflammatory-sweet-cherries-or-tart-cherries/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gout-treatment-with-a-cherry-on-top/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-adults-to-eat-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-life-is-a-bowl-of-cherries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-iodine-can-be-as-bad-as-too-little/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-intestines-for-food-and-cosmetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-copper-and-saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tongue-worm-in-human-eye/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ergothioneine-a-new-vitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/copper/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ergothioneine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cadmium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/purines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gout/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/tobacco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/seafood/	
T-1357	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/organic-foods/	organic foods	The benefits of consuming an abundance of conventional produce or soy foods likely far outweigh the risks of pesticides, but why accept any risk at all when you can choose organic? There are also broader benefits for the environment.Rinsing our produce under running water may only remove around 15% of pesticides, but one can easily make a vinegar or salt water fruit and vegetable wash that works better.Test tube studies suggest organic produce may be more health-promoting.  Organic berries, for example, appear to suppress the growth of cancer cells better than conventional berries.There is little difference in the level of vitamins and minerals between organic and conventionally grown produce, but higher levels of beneficial phenolic phytonutrients have been found in organic produce.  Also, organic produce may present less of a food safety risk.  Poultry that is raised organically may be less contaminated with arsenic-containing drugs and multi-drug resident bacteria, and organic pork may pose less risk of Yersinia, an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In general, eating lower on the food chain may reduce exposure to chemical residues.  To avoid fungal toxins, it may be better to consume organic rather than conventional apple juice. The hormones naturally found in even organic animal foods may help explain why women eating vegan are five times less likely to give birth to twins. The hormones in dairy may contribute to disease by bypassing our body’s natural feedback systems. Monsanto’s Roundup has been demonstrated to exert adverse effects on human placental tissue, and GMO soybeans have substantially more pesticide residues than organic or conventional non-GMO soy. Yet Bt toxin is considered so non-toxic that it is sprayed on organic fruits and vegetables.Children raised on largely organic, vegetarian diets may have a lower prevalence of asthma and allergies. The President’s Cancer Panel report recommends choosing organic, especially for children, the most vulnerable population for increased environmental cancer risk.	-	pesticides,fish,cancer,meat,vegetables,dairy,chicken,fruit,animal products,industrial pollutants,women's health,exercise,plant-based diets,heavy metals,carcinogens	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/23/reducing-arsenic-in-chicken-and-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/01/foods-for-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/17/organic-milk-and-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/26/how-to-counter-dietary-pollutants-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/15/superbugs-on-retail-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/10/viral-food-poisoning-from-pesticides/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-best-lowers-phthalate-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veg-table-dietary-nitrate-scoring-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-prevention-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-more-nutritious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-make-your-own-fruit-and-vegetable-wash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superbugs-in-conventional-vs-organic-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-of-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-gmos-safe-the-case-of-roundup-ready-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-fighting-berries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/norovirus-food-poisoning-from-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-climate-change-cooking-up-a-storm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-gmos-safe-the-case-of-bt-corn/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pesticides,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegan,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/children,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-fighting-berries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/	
T-1365	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/osteoporosis/	osteoporosis	Plant-based sources of calcium are superior to animal-based sources (kale and broccoli absorbed nearly twice as well as the calcium in cow’s milk). A comparison of the bone mineral density of vegans to omnivores found that though omnivores have more than twice as much calcium intake due to dairy consumption, both had the same bone density. Though dietary intake studies show that those eating vegan tend to be deficient in calcium as well as two other nutrients, those eating conventional diets also tend to be deficient in calcium (and 6 other nutrients). Soymilk can provide the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk as long as the soymilk is shaken. There does not appear to be credence to the theory that protein intake in is bad for bones, but AGEs and coffee consumption may have adverse effects on bone health.	-	aging,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,bone health,women's health,cancer,heart health,bone fractures,cardiovascular health,stroke,chronic diseases,mortality,elderly,calcium,dairy	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/31/why-is-milk-consumption-associated-with-more-bone-fractures/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/24/exercise-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/14/what-do-meat-purge-and-cola-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/31/does-animal-protein-cause-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/20/how-beans-help-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/28/phytates-in-beans-anti-nutrient-or-anti-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/glycotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-vs-cow-calcium-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-beans-theyre-good-for-your-heart/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-effective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/longer-life-within-walking-distance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-treatment-of-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-calcium-supplements-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-healthiest-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reductionism-deficiency-mentality/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-good-for-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-protein-bad-to-the-bone/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chamomile-tea-may-not-be-safe-during-pregnancy/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/glycotoxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-vs-cow-calcium-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-protein-bad-to-the-bone/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omnivores/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/long-term-vegan-bone-health/	
T-1367	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ovarian-cancer/	ovarian cancer	Foods that appear to be protective against ovarian cancer include: soy foods, tea, apples, cranberries, Indian gooseberries, sweet potatoes, and carrots. As an epithelial cancer, sometimes prevention and treatment are the same thing. Foods thought to increase ovarian cancer risk include: smoking, acrylamide, dairy products, and meat. A 3% increase in meat intake may increase bladder cancer by 15%. This may be due to foreign proteins from animals such as  Neu5G which can accumulate in the cancer cells, including ovarian tissue. Women at risk for ovarian cancer might also consider limiting milk consumption, especially milk from pregnant cows that is particularly high in estrogens, as it contains many endogenous sex hormones that may disrupt the body’s natural cycle. Beta-carotene is also an important antioxidant found in high concentrations in the cervical region that may inhibit ovarian cancer.	-	cancer,women's health,breast cancer,prostate cancer,colon cancer,estrogen,fruit,milk,plant-based diets,dairy,ovary health,animal products,vegetarians,hormones,fish	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/12/anti-cancer-nutrient-synergy-in-cranberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/08/a-low-methionine-diet-may-help-starve-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vitamin-d-supplements-reduce-the-risk-of-dying-from-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beta-carotene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ovarian-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cranberries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/	
T-1368	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ovary-health/	ovary health	In one study in which 97,000 women were followed, those who ate lots of soy phytonutrients cut the risk of ovarian cancer in half. Coffee was a long time ago linked to ovarian cancer, but this turned out to be due to smoking, not coffee. Coffee is now thought to actually be protective against cancer. Green tea consumption may halve the risk of getting ovarian cancer. People who ate just one apple a day appear to have less risk of ovarian cancer. Indian gooseberries have found to be protective against many types of cancer, including ovarian. And beta carotene in foods may prevent ovarian cancer. Acrylamide is a neurotoxic industrial chemical found in french fries that has been linked to ovarian cancer. Meat consumption appears to be associated with female infertility (by interfering with ovulation). Hormone dependent cancers, such as ovarian cancer, may be linked to milk and dairy products because the commercial milk we drink today is from pregnant cows, so it contains high levels of steroid sex hormones. Japanese researchers, noticing the spike in their country in these cancers, have linked the increase to hormones found in American meat. It is now thought that cancers such as ovarian may grow for twenty years before they are detected.	-	women's health,cancer,breast cancer,breast health,plant-based diets,ovarian cancer,vegetarians,breast disease,infertility,vegans,menstruation,fruit,hormones,medications,eggs	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/08/a-low-methionine-diet-may-help-starve-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-flax-seeds-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benefits-of-marjoram-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/	
T-1379	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/paleolithic-diets/	paleolithic diets	The modern Paleo Diet is based on the simple idea that the diet humans ate in pre-agricultural, Paleolithic times is best suited for human health. Whether what these short-lived humans ate is truly the optimal diet for people today is a matter of considerable debate.At first glance, the assumption that our nutritional requirements were established in the prehistoric past seems reasonable. But the question is, which period should we base our diets on?A key shortcoming of the Paleo diet rationale is that it ignores the first 90% of our evolution. Why consider just the last 2 million years of our existence when mankind evolved for 25 million years? Pre-agricultural diets consisted of wild plants, wild animals and wild fish, but the volume varied widely, depending on location, season, and hunting and gathering skills. People didn’t eat oil, sugar, salt, processed foods or the milk of other mammals. This is the diet today’s Paleo Diet fans try to mimic.Nutritional anthropologists believe vegan diets may more closely match the macro- and micronutrient intake of Paleolithic diets than new paleo diets. Analysis of human paleo feces and undigested plant remains strongly suggests that for most of our existence, people ate a fiber-filled, plant-based diet. Our hunter-gatherer days occurred only toward the end of our evolution.There’s a big difference between the food consumed today and that eaten in the Paleolithic era. The wild animals eaten then provided about 6 to 16 percent of calories from fat compared to about 40 to 60 percent in today’s domestic animals—even those that are grass-fed. Prehistoric meat was also free of hormones, antibiotics and environmental contaminants. Insects were a significant protein source.Hybrid strains of fruits and vegetables are chosen today based on how easily they’re transported and a blemish-free appearance rather than nutritional value. Wild or uncultivated plants, it should be noted, provide about four times the fiber of commercially grown plants.Today’s Paleo Diet eschews grains and legumes, despite these foods having a long history as a valuable protein and calorie source around the world, including those regions where the people are among the longest and healthiest on the planet. The Paleo Diet may harm heart health by impairing arterial function. Studies have shown that diets typified by high protein and fat but low carbohydrates were associated with poorer peripheral small artery function.At the same time, the Paleo Diet’s emphasis on consuming bone broth ignores the heavy lead contamination of meat and fish from fish by-products fed to farmed animals and fish. Even broth made from organic chicken bones was found to contain markedly high lead concentrations. Lead has adverse effects on nearly every organ in the body and tends to stay in the body for as much as 30 years.The Paleo Diet’s emphasis on consuming large quantities of meat ignores numerous health risks associated with eating meat and fish, along with the many ethical issues associated with industrial farm practices and its long-term unsustainability.	-	plant-based diets,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,fruit,heart health,vegetarians,vegans,cardiovascular health,vegetables,cancer,meat,fiber,cholesterol,mortality,protein	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/19/low-carb-diets-and-coronary-blood-flow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/23/will-the-real-paleo-diet-please-stand-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/low-carb-diets-and-coronary-blood-flow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lose-two-pounds-one-sitting-taking-mioscenic-route/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diet-studies-show-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-fiber-really-prevent-diverticulosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-great-protein-fiasco/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-natural-human-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/miocene-meteorites-and-uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleopoo-what-we-can-learn-from-fossilized-feces/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flesh-and-fructose/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/legumes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/lead,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/whole-grains,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/23/will-the-real-paleo-diet-please-stand-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health/

Being diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer means, on average, about 6 more months of life.  Pancreatitis, which is chronic inflammation of the pancreas, may lead to pancreatic cancer.  Eating a varied plant-based diet may be an effective way of preventing cancer, including pancreatic cancer. One study found two handfuls of nuts per week may help protect against pancreatic cancer.  Phytate, found in beans, grains, nuts, and seeds, may inhibit the growth of different cancer cells, including those of pancreatic cancer. Curcumin has been tested against different cancers, including pancreatic cancer, and may provide temporary relief to some pancreatic cancer patients. Coffee consumption has been linked with a reduced incidence of pancreatic cancer.The nitrite preservatives in processed meat have been significantly associated with pancreatic cancer. Bacon and chicken consumption may significantly increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.  Well-cooked meat and deep-fried food intake may be associated with increased risk of different cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Research involving poultry workers indicates that cancer-causing viruses in poultry may explain increased risks of death from liver and pancreatic cancers. The largest study on nutrition ever has linked the consumption of animal fat and animal protein with pancreatic cancer.The Ayurvedic herbal formulation, Triphala, may be helpful in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, samples have been found to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals, so one has to be cautious. 	-	cancer,breast cancer,women's health,beans,fruit,colon cancer,vegetables,inflammation,leukemia,meat,mortality,prostate cancer,turmeric,carcinogens,spices	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/31/treating-pancreatic-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/09/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-carcinogens-in-animal-fat-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/largest-study-ever/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-aspartame-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-more-to-weigh-less/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-c-supplements-for-terminal-cancer-patients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hot-dogs-leukemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-ayurvedic-medicine-worse-than-lead-paint-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-carcinogens-in-animal-fat-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/largest-study-ever/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heavy-metals,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/	
T-1391	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parasites/	parasites	Up to nearly 10% of Americans may be infected with brain parasites found in undercooked meat. One example is the brain-invasive pork tapeworm, which is the most common cause of adult-onset epilepsy. Allergenic fish worms found in nearly two-thirds of retail fish tested can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. There have been migratory skin worms found in undercooked fish (like in sushi). Cheese may contain mites and maggots and organ meats may contain other worms. Nearly 95% of tested retail U.S. beef (including burgers) has been found to be parasite infested. The meat industry has responded to this problem by feeding arsenic to chickens and turkeys to reduce the parasite load; this arsenic may be linked to increased cancer risk in consumers, and adding bacteria-eating viruses to meat would not help one avoid the brain parasite, toxoplasma, the second leading cause of foodborne disease-related death in the United States. Being bitten by the external parasite, a lone star tick, may result in developing an allergy to meat.	-	meat,foodborne illness,brain disease,food poisoning,pork,seafood,poultry,brain parasites,chicken,worms,brain health,fish,cancer,insects,autoimmune diseases	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/23/reducing-arsenic-in-chicken-and-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/26/chronic-headaches-and-pork-parasites/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/27/hives-from-tick-bite-induced-meat-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/03/how-animal-proteins-may-trigger-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/21/treating-migraines-with-lavender/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/25/how-a-tick-bite-can-lead-to-food-allergies/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/not-so-delusional-parasitosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alpha-gal-and-the-lone-star-tick/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/allergenic-fish-worms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chronic-headaches-and-pork-tapeworms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheese-mites-and-maggots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/migratory-skin-worms-from-sushi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tick-bites-meat-allergies-and-chronic-urticaria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-epilepsy-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/usda-parasite-game/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tongue-worm-in-human-eye/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/not-so-delusional-parasitosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alpha-gal-and-the-lone-star-tick/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheese-mites-and-maggots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arsenic,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/migratory-skin-worms-from-sushi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/usda-parasite-game/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tick-bites-meat-allergies-and-chronic-urticaria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/allergenic-fish-worms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tongue-worm-in-human-eye/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/whats-in-a-burger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/arsenic-in-chicken/	
T-1393	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/parkinsons-disease/	Parkinson's disease	Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects a person’s movement. Parkinson’s is diagnosed in more than 50,000 Americans each year and is now the 15th leading killer in the U.S.There have been reported Parkinson’s cases among people who have worked for years in pesticide production plants. There may be a link between dairy product intake and risk for Parkinson’s disease, caused perhaps by low levels of neurotoxic chemicals in cheese and banned pesticides in contaminated dairy products.Beta-carboline neurotoxins, which can be found in beef, chicken, pork, and fish, have been linked to cases of Parkinson’s disease, tremor, addiction, and cancer. A USDA study found about one in six U.S. lambs infected with the parasite toxoplasma, which has been linked to risk for Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Excess iron intake and nitrites, found in cured meats, appear to be linked with Parkinson’s. BMAA, a neurotoxin that can be found in seafood and blue-green algae, may be linked to risk for Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and Alzheimer’s disease.Filtered coffee may protect against Parkinson’s. Regular intake of cooked or sprouted beans may also help lower risk against neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s disease, and Alzheimer’s. Many modern drugs, including those used to treat Parkinson’s, are derived from plants.  A whole foods, plant-based diet, may help in the treatment of Parkinson’s symptoms.	-	Alzheimer’s disease,brain disease,brain health,cancer,neurotoxins,meat,heart health,heart disease,smoking,protein,women's health,pesticides,fish,milk,cardiovascular disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/12/gmo-soy-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/21/foods-linked-to-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/03/sprouted-lentils-healthier-canned-lentils/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/18/gluten-sensitivity-put-to-the-test/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/parkinsons-disease-and-the-uric-acid-sweet-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-safer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppers-and-parkinsons-the-benefits-of-smoking-without-the-risks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-something-in-tobacco-protective-against-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooked-beans-or-sprouted-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/could-lactose-explain-the-milk-and-parkinsons-disease-link/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-sensitivity-real/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-carcinogens-in-animal-fat-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-nitrates-pollutants-or-nutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/berries-vs-pesticides-in-parkinsons-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blue-green-algae-spirulina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gmo-soy-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooked-beans-or-sprouted-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Alzheimers-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-carcinogens-in-animal-fat-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/coffee,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-coffee-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-nitrates-pollutants-or-nutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blue-green-algae-spirulina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/als-lou-gehrigs-disease-fishing-for-answers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-other-banned-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beef,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/	
T-1400	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pcbs/	PCBs	Polychlorinated biphenyls, also known as PCBs, are industrial chemicals considered to be carcinogens. PCBs may adversely affect male sperm counts and may be responsible for early onset puberty.  Exposure to organic pollutants including PCBs, dioxins, and certain chlorine-containing pesticides may be a risk factor for metabolic diseases like diabetes.  The U.S. Congress banned PCB production in 1979, leading to a decline in contamination levels. However, most U.S. women today are contaminated with heavy metals, toxic solvents, endocrine disrupters, fire retardant chemicals, pesticides, and PCBs. Except for people living or working around industrial sites, the most common source of exposure to PCBs may be from eating animal foods, especially seafood, but also meat, cheese, eggs, dairy, and poultry.PCBs can build up in animal fat and cannot be fully removed by washing or cooking.  Once in the body, organic pollutants including PCBs and dioxin can persist for years.  Pregnant mothers may pass on some of their accumulated PCBs to their children through the pregnancy itself and later through breastfeeding.  A study showed that the children exposed at birth to PCBs from their mothers needed four to nine years to rid their bodies of about one-half of their PCB amounts.Research indicates the top three sources to be fish oil, fish, and eggs.  Fish are a key source of PCBs, dioxins, and other pollutants likely because of what washes into the sea. Farmed salmon averages almost ten times the PCB load of wild-caught salmon.  Use of fish oil supplements, even those marketed as being distilled, can also expose people to PCBs and other pollutants. A study of 13 over-the-counter children’s fish oil supplements found that all were contaminated with PCB pollutants.Eating a plant-based diet appears to help lower PCB levels in the body.	-	persistent organic pollutants,fish,supplements,mercury,industrial pollutants,DHA,omega-3 fatty acids,diabetes,pregnancy,fish oil,animal fat,dioxins,obesity,weight loss,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/11/salmon-may-be-the-greatest-source-of-dietary-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/28/dioxins-stored-in-our-own-fat-may-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/28/how-to-reduce-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/21/protecting-our-babies-from-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/16/dietary-estrogens-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/23/why-would-eating-fish-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/27/want-to-help-prevent-parkinsons-disease-avoid-this/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lowering-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-pcb-chemical-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-to-reduce-stroke-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-prostate-cancer-and-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegan-women-supplement-with-dha-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-and-dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lowering-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-and-dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-oil-in-troubled-waters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/	
T-1403	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/peanut-butter/	peanut butter	Peanuts are technically not nuts; they belong to the legume family. However, they should be considered nuts because of their nutritional profile. Peanuts and peanut butter contain many vitamins, minerals, plant compounds, and antioxidants, and have numerous health benefits. Pairing vegetables with peanut butter has even been suggested for vegetable-resistant children.Peanuts and peanut butter are high-calorie foods. Studies were conducted to find out whether ingesting these foods contributes to weight gain, and concluded that when either half a cup of peanuts or half a cup of peanut butter was fed to people in addition to their regular diet, every day for a month, neither group gained weight.Peanuts and peanut butter are one of the top sources of arginine, a type of amino acid involved in protein synthesis. A 2010 study suggests that the arginine content of nuts may boost fat–burning in the body.Early nut consumption may prevent breast cancer. A 2013 study found that those eating more peanut butter, nuts, beans, lentils, soybeans, or corn had a fraction of the risk for fibrocystic breast disease. The protective effects were strongest for those with a family history of breast cancer.Alzheimer’s disease appears to start in the part of the brain that handles smell before spreading to other brain regions. One of the first clinical signs of the disease is changes in the sense of smell. A group of researchers at the University of Florida conducted a smell test, asking Alzheimer’s patients to smell a spoonful of peanut butter at a short distance from each nostril. The peanut butter had to get all the way up to two inches from the left nostril to be detected in all patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease.	-	nuts,vegetables,almonds,beans,cancer,peanuts,fruit,weight loss,grains,obesity,calories,fat,pistachios,women's health,walnuts	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/17/how-to-get-our-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/25/nutritionfacts-org-the-first-month/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/19/choosing-the-best-nutrition-bar/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-home/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-green-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-strengthen-the-mind-body-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-vinegar-help-with-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peanut-butter-smell-test-for-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/	http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/legume,http://nutritionfacts.org/?fwp_search=fat-burning&fwp_content_type=video,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease	
T-1404	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/peanuts/	peanuts	Peanuts are part of the legume family (edible seeds enclosed in pods), and are sometimes called “oilseeds” because their seeds yield oil.Daily intake of peanuts or tree nuts can extend longevity, cut the risk of having a heart attack in half, decrease the risk of dying from heart disease, and help reduce cholesterol. Peanuts and tree nuts have been shown to inhibit cancer growth in vitro, and help decrease the risk for fibrocystic breast disease.Nuts, including peanuts, appear to boost the metabolism and suppress the appetite, possibly because their contain arginine, which helps boost fat-burning within the body. Peanuts are a natural source of resveratrol, although there is limited and conflicting human data demonstrating any human benefits of resveratrol, especially in supplement form.Eating or avoiding peanuts when pregnant does not appear to affect children’s future risk of developing a peanut allergy.	-	nuts,weight loss,pistachios,cancer,heart health,cardiovascular health,women's health,cardiovascular disease,mortality,heart disease,soybeans,fat,obesity,pine nuts,peanut butter	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resveratrol-impairs-exercise-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/halving-heart-attack-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-nut-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peanuts-in-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-health,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/resveratrol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fibrocystic-breast-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/longevity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/metabolism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arginine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/legumes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	
T-1406	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/peas/	peas	Dried peas such as split peas are considered pulses, whereas fresh green peas are not. Up to 3-5 daily servings of split peas or other legumes such as lentils and beans, can be an important part of a healthy, whole-food, plant-based diet.  The most recent federal dietary guidelines highlight beans and dried peas as unique foods, since they contribute to both protein and vegetable serving goals. Split peas also provide magnesium and antioxidants.The intake of legumes, including beans, chickpeas, split peas, and lentils, may be the single most important dietary predictor of a long lifespan and can lead to weight loss, improved dental health, protect against skin wrinkles (although green peas may not help with cellulite), improved prostate health, lower inflammation, and a lower risk of breast cancer.You don’t get the same blood sugar spike from eating split peas and other legumes as you would from eating the same amount of carbs in the form of bread, pasta, or potatoes. Diabetics’ regular, long-term intake of pulses may help with blood sugar control.	-	beans,lentils,vegetables,fruit,standard American diet,grains,vegans,plant-based diets,vegetarians,dietary guidelines,legumes,diabetes,tobacco,cancer,blood sugar	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/21/making-your-own-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/24/which-works-better-adding-beans-or-portion-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/05/do-eden-beans-have-too-much-iodine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/02/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-treat-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/16/eat-beans-to-live-longer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-wrinkles-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetics-should-take-their-pulses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-progressing-from-pyramid-to-plate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increased-lifespan-from-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beauty-is-more-than-skin-deep/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-pushback-from-the-sugar-salt-and-meat-industries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slimming-the-gecko-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-antioxidant-superstars-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fiber-vs-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-five-to-one-fiber-rule/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-gout-attacks-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-sugar-takes-on-the-world-health-organization/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beauty-is-more-than-skin-deep/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slimming-the-gecko-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fiber-vs-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-progressing-from-pyramid-to-plate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/increased-lifespan-from-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/	
T-1407	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pecans/	pecans	Of all the nuts, the healthiest ones are pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts (or filberts), pistachios and almonds. Nuts are nutritional powerhouses. Clinical trials have shown nuts help lower cholesterol and oxidation, improve arterial function, and decrease blood sugar levels.Among the findings from a Harvard study that tracked more than 100,000 people for decades was that daily nut eaters experienced fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease and respiratory disease, regardless of age, weight, alcohol intake or exercise regimen. Just a few servings a week – about the size of two small handfuls – may boost longevity.Despite widespread assumptions that eating lots of nuts leads to weight gain, recent studies show that frequent nut consumption does not seem to affect body weight, body mass index or waist circumference.Data gleaned from the Harvard Nurse’s Study indicates early nut consumption may prevent breast cancer, and a follow-up study of the daughters of those nurses confirmed the findings: that is, those who ate more fiber and nuts during adolescence, like peanut butter, nuts, beans, lentils, soybeans or corn, had a fraction of the risk for fibrocystic breast disease, which is a marker for increased breast cancer risk. Just two servings of nuts a week during high school was associated with a 36% lower risk compared to those who rarely ate nuts. When looking at how nuts may combat other types of cancer, walnuts, pecans and peanuts were shown to cause a dramatic drop in human liver cancer proliferation at very small doses; similar results were found when pitting nuts against human colon cancer cells.	-	nuts,antioxidants,vegetables,fruit,almonds,walnuts,ranking foods,goji berries,spices,peanuts,pistachios,pine nuts,macadamia nuts,cloves,cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/17/amla-indian-gooseberries-versus-cancer-diabetes-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-nut-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-antioxidant-superstars-2/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blood-sugar/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pistachios,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hazelnuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/almonds,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/harvard-nurses-health-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/peanuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/walnuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fibrocystic-breast-disease/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/longevity	
T-1411	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/penis-health/	penis health	Diet may affect erectile function. In a case study featured in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a man following the low-carb, Atkins diet, lowered his weight, but also suffered chest pains and lost his ability to have an erection. Erectile dysfunction may be an early sign of vascular disease and cardiovascular risk. Pistachio nut intake may improve penial erectile function (as well as lower cholesterol). Watermelon, because it contains the amino acid citrulline, may also help with penile blood flow in mild erectile dysfunction cases, and eating antioxidant-rich plant foods may improve blood flow to all parts of the body, including penile arteries.Diet during pregnancy can also be important for an infant’s penis health. A mother’s chicken consumption during pregnancy may affect the size and development of her son’s penis due to phthalate contamination of the meat. The risk of a birth defect of the penis called hypospadias was found to be doubled when the mother frequently consumed conventional (non-organic) high-fat dairy products. Endocrine-disrupting compounds sometimes found in fish may reduce eventual penis size in boys and adversely affect sexual functioning in men.	-	sexual health,men's health,women's health,sexual dysfunction,cardiovascular disease,impotence,cancer,erectile dysfunction,mortality,dairy,children,cholesterol,cardiovascular health,antioxidants,meat	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/22/foods-for-a-long-life-and-love-life/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/20/pills-vs-diet-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/27/pistachios-may-help-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/18/why-do-vegan-women-have-fewer-female-cancers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/10/medical-care-the-third-leading-cause-of-death/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-power-of-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-consumption-and-the-feminization-of-male-genitalia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-prevention-is-worth-a-ton-of-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/rosy-glow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-penis-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-exposure-tied-to-liver-and-pancreatic-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-might-vegetarians-have-less-hpv/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-power-of-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/rosy-glow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-consumption-and-the-feminization-of-male-genitalia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-organic-foods-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish	
T-1423	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/persistent-organic-pollutants/	persistent organic pollutants	Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemical substances that persist in the environment and bio-accumulate through the food web. POPs may be linked to a range of health concerns, including endometriosis, gum disease, fibrosis, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular mortality. Those eating plant-based diets may be significantly less polluted with industrial toxins than omnivores. Fish may be the biggest source of POPs for consumers along with milk. Farmed Atlantic salmon, the kind of salmon most commonly found in restaurants and supermarkets, may be the single largest food source of POPs. Perflurochemicals, which may enter the body mostly through meat and fish, may be linked to thyroid disease risk. It can take the body as long as 10 years to get rid of about one-half of certain ingested POPs such as dioxins and PCBs. 	-	meat,mercury,fish,vegetarians,plant-based diets,vegans,cardiovascular disease,DHA,brain disease,brain health,heart health,heart disease,PCBs,cardiovascular health,omega-3 fatty acids	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/05/dioxins-in-us-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/23/reducing-arsenic-in-chicken-and-rice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/13/estrogen-animal-products/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/11/salmon-may-be-the-greatest-source-of-dietary-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/28/dioxins-stored-in-our-own-fat-may-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/16/dietary-estrogens-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/23/why-would-eating-fish-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lowering-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-pollutants-and-child-development/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/could-lactose-explain-the-milk-and-parkinsons-disease-link/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lead-contamination-bone-broth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-to-reduce-stroke-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/omega-3s-prostate-cancer-and-atrial-fibrillation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegan-women-supplement-with-dha-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-u-s-farm-raised-catfish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-and-dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pregnant-breastfeeding-women-take-dha/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-epa-and-dha-omega-3-for-our-heart/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lowering-dietary-antibiotic-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/thyroid-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease	
T-1424	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pesticides/	pesticides	Eight-hundred-million pounds of pesticides are used annually in the United States. Human exposure to pesticides may occur by accident. For example, a 1969 dioxin outbreak resulted from a pipe mix-up at a plant that was producing both pesticides and animal feed. People can also be exposed to pesticides via residues on plant food sources: bamboo shoots imported from China had pesticide contamination levels that were over a suggested safety limit. GMO soybeans have significantly higher pesticide residues than organic or conventional non-GMO soy. Also, some plants may contain fecal viruses due to manure contamination of the water used to spray pesticides on crops.While some plant foods may be contaminated, animal food intake is the biggest source of certain pesticide exposure for both adults and children. Pesticides, as well as antibiotics, manure, pus cells, cholesterol, and saturated fat have all been found in milk. Factory farmed fish have higher levels of DDT and other banned pesticides than wild-caught fish, and even fish oil supplements may be contaminated with PCBs and insecticides. Many pesticides take a long time to degrade – the U.S. made arsenic-based pesticides illegal years ago, but they still persist in the soil. Similarly, though DDT was banned in the U.S. for agricultural use in 1972, people may still be exposed to the pesticide through contaminated dairy products and meat. Most American women have pesticides and other toxins in their bloodstream. Thus is not surprising since even the U.S. Inspector General found that the USDA was not providing adequate protection from pesticide exposure. Luckily, not all pesticides may be connected to health concerns. For example, the Bt toxin produced by the GMO crop known as Bt corn is a pesticide considered so nontoxic that it is sprayed on organic fruits and vegetables. In other cases, we don’t have enough research to definitively know. The pesticide Roundup has been found to be 100 times more toxic than its active ingredient, glyphosate. Still, due to the lack of truly informative human studies, it is unknown to what degree application of Roundup on is harmful to human health, and we have to be aware of conflicts of interest when reading scientific studies.On the other hand, some pesticides have been more definitively linked to harmful effects on human health. For example, some pesticides may increase the risk of multiple allergic symptoms, male infertility, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and cancer.Consumers often want organic vegetables and fruits to reduce pesticide intake, and indeed, by eating organic, we can reduce our exposure to pesticides, though it remains unclear whether such a reduction in exposure is clinically relevant.  However, if a person cannot get organic produce, the benefits from adequate vegetable and fruit intake may dramatically outweigh any risks of eating conventional produce with residues. Overall, those eating plant-based diets have been found to have a lower levels of pesticides than omnivores. Rinsing produce in a salt water solution may be an effective way to reduce pesticide residues on produce.	-	organic foods,cancer,brain health,Alzheimer’s disease,dairy,meat,women's health,industrial

T-1442	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/physicians-committee-for-responsible-medicine/	Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine	A non-profit research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C., the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) promotes bringing nutrition into medical education and practice, conducting clinical research on healthful diets, educating the public on how diet can impact their health, and advocating for alternatives to animal research. PCRM was established in 1985 by Dr. Neal Barnard.Examples of the work done by PCRM include poster-style infographics such as “The Five Worst Contaminants in Chicken Products” (feces, toxic chemicals, superbugs, carcinogens, and cholesterol). They also conduct real-world research, such as the first-ever workplace intervention study, which took place at Geico corporate headquarters. Significant health benefits came as a result of educating employees about plant-based diets and offering some healthier options in the cafeteria. PCRM also ran a campaign called “Meat is the new tobacco.” Dr. Barnard’s editorials and PCRM’s other related materials tried to get across the argument that moving to a plant-based diet can now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking.	-	plant-based diets,heart health,cardiovascular disease,Dr. Neal Barnard,heart disease,weight loss,vegans,vegetarians,vegetables,grains,cardiovascular health,Dr. Dean Ornish,obesity,beans,processed foods	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/24/wisconsin-milk-marketing-board-accused-of-making-illegally-deceptive-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/12/evidence-based-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/18/paula-deen-diabetes-drug-spokesperson/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/07/dietary-guideline-graphics-from-the-food-pyramid-to-myplate-harvards-healthy-eating-plate-and-pcrms-power-plate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/18/what-is-actually-in-chicken-nuggets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/03/physician-assisted-suicide-when-doctors-give-nutrition-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/29/vegan-workplace-intervention/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-medicine-or-evidence-biased/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-wait-until-your-doctor-kicks-the-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/slimming-the-gecko-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/autopsy-of-chicken-nuggets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/workplace-intervention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-neal-barnard/	
T-1445	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytoestrogens/	phytoestrogens	Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like compounds found in a variety of plant foods such as beans, seeds, and grains, though they are concentrated in soy foods and flax. Phytoestrogens appear to be helpful in the prevention of diabetes and cancers of the colon, liver, brain, breast, ovaries, and skin. “Bad” cholesterol appears to be reduced, cardiovascular risk decreased, and weight loss increased when they are consumed. Soy phytoestrogens do not decrease male fertility; however, xenoestrogens, which are found mainly in fish, have been shown to drastically lower sperm counts. Replacing dairy with soy may decrease abdominal fat.	-	soy,women's health,cancer,breast cancer,breast health,estrogen,breast disease,Japan,Asia,flax seeds,mortality,hormones,vegetables,isoflavones,fruit	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/29/soy-and-breast-cancer-an-update/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-endometriosis-with-seaweed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-are-the-effects-of-the-hops-phytoestrogen-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-soy-healthy-for-breast-cancer-survivors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-flax-seeds-help-prevent-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/waistline-slimming-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-most-potent-phytoestrogen-is-in-beer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nine-servings-a-day-minimum/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-women-at-high-risk-for-breast-cancer-avoid-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-hormones-male-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-phytosterols-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival-epidemiological-evidence/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-coffee/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/soy-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/waistline-slimming-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/soy-breast-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/soy-hormones-male-infertility/	
T-1446	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/	phytonutrients	Plants contain more than 100,000 phytonutrients, one of the reasons nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day are recommended. Some phytonutrients are fat soluble and, thus, need fat to be properly absorbed. Certain phytonutrients are also better absorbed from cooked, rather than raw, food. Phytonutrients may in part account for the benefits of whole plant foods in cancer prevention. Dates, berries, strawberries, coffee, earl grey tea, chai tea, and green tea (see also here, here) are high in phytonutrients. Milk and soymilk, however, may block the absorption of phytonutrients (see also here). Variety in a diet appears to boost the effectiveness of phytonutrients due to nutrient synergy and also because different plants and vegetables have different phytonutrients. A healthy eating index has even been created based on phytochemical consumption. Phytonutrients, when eaten, literally bathe our systems, as evidenced by garlic breath and pink urine from eating beets, which are packed with phytonutrients. On average, plant foods have 64 times more antioxidants than animal foods, and when it comes to antioxidants, the more we eat, the more we may benefit. Boiling and pressure cooking reduce the antioxidant content of foods more than any other method. Antioxidants also appear to increase stool size, which has been associated with a lower cancer risk, and protect NO synthase, the enzyme that produces the artery-relaxing signal nitric oxide. Eating a diet high in antioxidants appears to reduce inflammation in the body. Beets, followed by red bell peppers, have been found to have the highest cellular antioxidant levels of vegetables. Other foods high in antioxidants include: Dragon’s Blood, Indian gooseberries (see here, here), triphala (although lead contamination makes it a bad choice), dried peppermint & cloves, dried pomegranate seeds, dried apple rings, blackberries, cranberries, cold steeped tea, idared apples, crabapples, dandelion tea, red rice, and carrots. Kale juice has also been found to be high in phytonutrients and eating kale, especially cooked, may boost our immune system. Interestingly, tomato juice seems to have greater phytonutrient availability than eating the actual tomato. Phytonutrients like lycopene in tomatoes appears to be protective against heart disease. The phytonutrients in cacao appear to be helpful in relieving the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. In terms of phytonutrient content, cocoa powder is the healthiest form of chocolate (see also here). Phytochemicals found in fruit and vegetable juices may have a protective affect against Alzheimer’s. Purple grape juice ranked the highest in terms of protection against Alzheimer’s due to the presence of high levels of phenolic phytonutrients. And when it comes to attractiveness, a rosy glow to the skin has been found to be preferred; phytonutrients, especially carotenoids (found in kale, for example) have been found to increase attractiveness, but taking them in pill form does not appear to work (see also here). The risk of glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness, appears to be dramatically reduced by kale or collard greens consumption, thanks to the phytonutrient pigments lutein and zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin have also been shown to be beneficial in protecting against cataracts and macular degeneration. Carrots, collard greens, and kale are high in these phytonutrients but, again, taking them in pill form does not appear to work. The phytonutrients in flax seeds assist our body in the formation of lignans, which are essential to healthy gut flora. The phytonutrient sulforaphane, found in broccoli, has been associated with lowering breast cancer risk as well as improving survival rates (see also here, here). Phytonutrients in broccoli may also decrease the metastatic potential of lung cancer. The phytonutrients in raw broccoli may help bladder cancer survival. Sulforaphane is more readily available in raw broccoli. Sulforaphane is also the most powerful natural inducer of our liver’s detoxifying enzyme system. Growing your own broccoli sprouts is probably the most nutrition you can get for your money. 100 cups of broccoli a day is the safe upper limit for consumption (see also here). Broccoli also appears to protect against DNA damage in smokers. Vitamin C, found most concentrated in fruits and vegetables, blocks carcinogenic nitrosamine production in our systems. However, in the presence of fat, Vitamin C actually increases nitrosamine production so adding it to meat may actually make it more carcinogenic. Four hot dogs have more nitrosamines than a pack of 20 cigarettes. Nitrosamines are formed from nitrites, which form nitrosamines in the absence of phytonutrients.	-	cancer,fruit,supplements,vegetables,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,heart

T-1463	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-protein/	plant protein	Many vegans and vegetarians are asked how they get enough protein. An analysis of the eating records of a large sample of people following plant-based diets showed that, on average, they got 70% more protein than they needed every day. Beans, including canned beans, are an excellent plant protein source, as are lentils and split peas. Other examples include nuts, seeds, and soy. The type of protein a person eats–primarily plant-based or primarily animal-based—matters to one’s health as food is a package deal: the protein cannot be isolated from other elements in the food. Overall, plant protein may provide healthier nutrients than animal protein. In the 1950’s, researchers found that  coronary heart disease was almost non-existent among Ugandans, who consume their protein almost entirely from plant sources. Plant protein consumption may be linked to lower risk of heart disease, while the intake of animal protein can be associated with increased risk. Plant protein also appears linked to lower cancer risk than animal protein.Nutritional research studies have found potential associations between a diet high in plant protein and the following beneficial effects:See also related health topics animal protein, beans, lentils, nuts, plant-based diets, protein, seeds, and soy.	-	animal protein,plant-based

T-1464	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/	plant-based diets	A significant convergence of evidence suggests that plant-based diets may help prevent and even reverse some of the top killer diseases in the Western world and can be more effective than medication and surgery. Many of the scourges of modern living might be prevented, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and Parkinson’s disease, age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, Crohn’s disease, gallstones, kidney stones, diverticulosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and vaginal infections.Additionally, plant-based eating may have a positive effect on abdominal fat, acne, aging, allergies, asthma, body odor, cellulite, childhood IQ, cognition, dysmenorrhea, eczema, gut flora, fibromyalgia, kidney stones, metabolic syndrome, menstrual breast pain, mood, multiple sclerosis, oral health, rheumatoid arthritis, waist circumference and weight control.Eating meat and other animal products may be associated with a shortened lifespans. Meat contains a high amount of saturated fat, trans fats, sulfur dioxide arachidonic acid and heme iron. Meat, fish, dairy and eggs may also increase our exposure to dietary antibiotics, industrial toxins, mercury and other toxic heavy metals, advanced glycation end-products (AGE)s, cadmium, xenoestrogens in fish and estrogenic meat carcinogens.A plant-based diet can detoxify the body of these pollutants. Even just small steps toward eating more fruit and vegetables may lengthen lifespan.Contrary to popular myth, vegans have healthy bones and higher blood protein levels than omnivores. Most vegans get more than enough protein. In one study, within a matter of weeks, participants placed on a plant-based diet experienced improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol and insulin levels, insulin resistance and C-reactive protein levels.Vegans may have fewer nutrient deficiencies than average omnivores while maintaining a lower body weight without losing muscle mass. Those eating plant-based diets appear to experience enhanced athletic recovery without affecting the benefits of exercise. The arteries of vegans appear healthier than even long-distance endurance athletes and those on low-carb diets. In fact, the Paleo Diet may increase the risk of toxin contamination, DNA damage and cancer.There are two vitamins people need that are not available in plants: vitamins D and B12. There is a serious risk of B12 deficiency if no supplements or B12-fortified foods are consumed. Two other nutrients to monitor are iodine and zinc. Yeast- or algae-based long chain omega 3 fatty acids may also be beneficial.Medical training continues to underemphasize nutrition education, and patients often do not receive information about all of their treatment options. Doctors report they don’t practice preventative cardiology because they believe their patients aren’t capable of changing their diets. Kaiser Permanente has begun more aggressive efforts to apprise patients about the advantages of plant-based diets.If significantly more people transitioned to plant-based diets, Medicare costs could drop by the billions of dollars. Plant-based diets may also help lessen greenhouse gas emissions and have a smaller impact on the environment.	-	vegans,vegetarians,meat,cancer,eggs,heart disease,heart health,mortality,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,diabetes,animal products,high blood pressure,smoking,stroke	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/20/how-to-prevent-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/23/the-five-most-important-dietary-tweaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/01/improving-employee-diets-could-save-companies-millions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/03/whats-the-mediterranean-diets-secret/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/28/white-meat-may-be-as-cholesterol-raising-as-red/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lose-two-pounds-one-sitting-taking-mioscenic-route/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-diet-soda-increase-stroke-risk-as-much-as-regular-soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-with-aspirin-aspirations/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-smoking-in-the-50s-is-like-eating-today/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/morning-sickness-may-protect-mother-and-child/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-diet-should-physicians-recommend/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-an-animated-summary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-plant-based-diets-help-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-take-aspirin-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-animal-protein-on-stress-hormones-testosterone-and-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-type-of-protein-is-better-for-our-kidneys/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-change-your-enterotype/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-consumption-and-the-development-of-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wakame-seaweed-salad-may-lower-blood-pressure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-foods-to-reduce-stroke-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-more-to-weigh-less/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-kidney-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die-from-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-response-to-choline-and-tmao/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-wait-until-your-doctor-kicks-the-habit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-treatment-for-angina/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/iodine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Vitamin-D-supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegans,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/high-blood-pressure,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/omnivores/	
T-1482	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/polyphenols/	polyphenols	There are many subgroups of polyphenols which include: lignans, flavonoids, and reservatrol. The chemical structure of polyphenols found in plant foods gives them a range of unique chemical and antioxidant properties, which can have many health benefits when we eat them.For example, the consumption of blueberries and strawberries is associated with delayed cognitive aging by as much as 2.5 years. The yellow pigment, curcumin, in the spice, turmeric, may work as good or better than anti-inflammatory drugs and pain killers for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, and also may benefit people with rheumatoid arthritis.Polyphenols may also play a role as angiogenesis inhibitors, preventing the growth of new blood vessels to tumors, thereby stopping cancer growth from getting any bigger than about the tip of a ball point pen. Foods high in polyphenols also appear protective against the development of skin wrinkles, and can have a role in changing the balance of bacteria to improve weight control.Green tea is a great source of polyphenols with the potential to reduce stroke risk, reduce your risk of dying from pneumonia, reduce seasonal allergy symptoms, reduce the risk of diabetes, and protect against cancer. Green tea may in part also be responsible for protecting the Asian population against heart disease, and lung cancer despite the popularity of smoking.Whole fruits and vegetables may work better than antioxidant supplements for their ability to treat seasonal allergies, improve lung function, and control asthma.The majority of polyphenol phytonutrients in plants may be bound to fiber (nonextractable polyphenols), helping to explain the marked difference in health impacts between whole fruit or vegetable compared to its individual parts. Apples should be eaten as a whole and not peeled, as apple peel extract has strong antiproliferative effects on breast and prostate cancer cells, and apple juice may be worse than sugar water.When it comes to polyphenols in legumes, their effectiveness may also be improved by cooking or sprouting.Your Chocolate fix contains a type of polyphenol called flavanols which are found in the highest concentrations in cocoa powder. But adding things (like the milk, and fats found in chocolate) to cocoa powder may negate the health benefits of the flavanols, so while cocoa is better than chocolate.	-	phytonutrients,fruit,inflammation,beans,vegetables,berries,grapes,tea,women's health,aging,citrus,fruit juice,split peas,dementia,oxidative stress	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/21/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/26/chronic-headaches-and-pork-parasites/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/20/how-beans-help-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/03/sprouted-lentils-healthier-canned-lentils/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-wrinkles-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beauty-is-more-than-skin-deep/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooked-beans-or-sprouted-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chronic-headaches-and-pork-tapeworms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-dates-figs-or-prunes-for-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-angiogenesis-cutting-off-tumor-supply-lines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/caution-anti-inflammatory-foods-in-the-third-trimester/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cocoa-good-chocolate-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-chocolate-fix/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/resveratrol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lignans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooked-beans-or-sprouted-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-angiogenesis-cutting-off-tumor-supply-lines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cocoa-good-chocolate-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthiest-chocolate-fix/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-skin-peeling-back-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber/

T-1495	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pork/	pork	Smithfield, the largest pork producer in the world, launched “Deli for the Cure,” which donates money to cancer research for every pound sold of the type of meat that, according to the World Cancer Research Fund’s cancer report, causes the most cancer. Cured meats such as bacon and ham contain carcinogenic nitrosamine from nitrite additives and should be avoided. Nitrosamines are been found in the smell of frying bacon. Total meat intake (including pork) appears to increase the risk for several cancers including multiple myeloma, kidney cancer, breast cancer,  colon cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer.A case report linked excessive pork consumption to a penis tumor caused by HPV, which can cause cancerous anal and genital warts. Pork consumption has also been linked to liver failure, due to hepatitis E (which is now known to be zoonotic). Pigs appear to be reservoirs of the virus. Chronic headaches, as well as symptoms of depression, have been linked to pork tapeworms. Pork tapeworms can take up residence the human brain, and in fact are the most common cause of adult onset epilepsy.Pork is a source of saturated fat as well as cholesterol. Saturated fat has been linked to lower rates of breast cancer survival. Eliminating pork from the diet can also help prevent kidney stones, gestational diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.Consumption of fecal bacteria from pigs is less of a problem than with chickens because normally pig’s skin is not consumed, and it is the skin that may be most contaminated. Arsenic has been fed intentionally to pigs (85 tons of arsenic compounds fed to pigs every year) and consequently may contaminate pork. Arachidonic acid is found in pork, among other meats, and appears to negatively affect mood. Pork has been found to contain PCBs. Retail pork samples have been found to be contaminated with staph bacteria (only turkey was found to be infected at higher rates than pork), C. difficile, MRSA and Yersinia.	-	plant-based

Acrylamide has been associated with several cancers and may cause inflammation, which may explain its purported role in cancer progression.	-	vegetables,fruit,cancer,junk food,french fries,vitamin C,processed foods,industry influence,chicken,beans,salt,smoking,vegetarians,potatoes,lung cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/13/are-raisins-a-good-snack-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-raisins-good-snacks-for-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-mgus-and-multiple-myeloma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-french-fries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-trans-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-carrageenan-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-the-benefits-of-organic-food-underrated-or-overrated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-dry-eye-disease-with-diet-just-add-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salt-of-the-earth-sodium-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-healthy-on-a-budget/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sodium-and-arterial-function-a-salting-our-endothelium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funded-research-bias/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/french-fries,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/potatoes,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/junk-food,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/acrylamide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/trans-fats/	
T-1503	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/potatoes/	potatoes	Potatoes contain a few phytonutrients, but may also have potato glycoalkaloids, which has been suggested to be harmful to humans Peeling white potatoes may remove three-quarters of the glycoalkaloids.. Conventionally grown potatoes may contain pesticides. If you soak potatoes in water, only about 2 to 13% of the pesticides are removed; a 5% acetic acid (vinegar) removes up to 100%. Salt water, appears to work as good or better than full-strength vinegar.Potato consumption may be associated with a 50% increased risk of kidney cancer, perhaps because of it’s high glycemic load. Purple potatoes however, may decrease inflammation.Sweet potatoes are a very health promoting food, and are an inexpensive cheap source of nutrients. The predominant protein in sweet potatoes may even have cancer fighting properties. Boiling may be the best way to cook sweet potatoes to preserve all the nutrients. The traditional diet in Okinawa (where some of the longest living people were once found) revolved around purple sweet potatoes.Microwaving a sweet potato and adding some cinnamon and cloves is a cheap, simple, easy snack loaded with antioxidants.	-	grains,vegetables,cancer,fruit,diabetes,beans,fish,fat,tomatoes,animal products,chicken,nuts,berries,heart disease,cardiovascular disease	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/21/making-your-own-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/08/currant-treatment-for-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/19/sweet-potato-proteins-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-consumption-and-the-feminization-of-male-genitalia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-specific-receptors-specific-fruits-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetables-rate-by-nitrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vinegar-mechanisms-side-effects/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/peppers-and-parkinsons-the-benefits-of-smoking-without-the-risks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/getting-starch-to-take-the-path-of-most-resistance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-cooked-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/constructing-a-cognitive-portfolio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-make-your-own-fruit-and-vegetable-wash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-white-bread-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/almonds-for-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whats-the-best-mouthwash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-of-glaucoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-vinegar-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-cancer-potential-of-sweet-potato-proteins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-flexitarians-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funded-research-bias/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-make-your-own-fruit-and-vegetable-wash/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-white-bread-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cinnamon,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-cook-sweet-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Sweet-potatoes,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-cooked-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-cancer-potential-of-sweet-potato-proteins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cloves	
T-1504	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry/	poultry	Over the past century, especially after World War II, Western diets have shifted to include more animal foods, including poultry, which has risen to the top in U.S. meat consumption. Of all the types of meat studied, poultry has been most associated with weight gain and may increase infertility risk. Endotoxins from poultry may increase inflammation and raise uric acid levels. The impact of poultry on cholesterol may be similar to that of beef and fish. Poultry intake may also increase fat oxidation and can increase choline and TMAO levels, both of which can contribute to heart attack and stroke risk.Processing plants inject poultry carcasses with salt water and with phosphorus preservatives. These can lead to high levels of sodium (a risk factor for high blood pressure) and contribute to osteoporosis, arterial stiffening, and acceleration of the aging process.Poultry has been found to contain antibiotic residues, PCBs, and organochlorine pesticides. Washing poultry may not help to remove pesticides, because they may reside in the fat tissue. Studies have discovered significant amounts arsenic, flame retardant chemicals, dioxin, and other drugs and chemicals in poultry meat. These drugs and chemicals can wind up in the consumer’s bloodstream.Most foodborne-related poisoning deaths are attributed to poultry. Poultry tends to be so covered in fecal bacteria that one is advised against rinsing poultry because of potential bacterial splatter. Cooking fecal matter will kill the pathogens, but cross contamination in the kitchen before cooking still results in millions of cases of foodborne illness every year. The fecal bacteria Campylobacter found in poultry can trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome, and certain strains of E. coli found in poultry are associated with urinary tract infections. Salmonella in poultry ranks as the 4th worst infected food in the U.S.  A study found that the Salmonella bacteria transfer rate of store-bought contaminated poultry legs to the cutting board after ten minutes is 80%.The CDC has found that poultry products are frequently contaminated with multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA bacteria, which currently kill more people in the U.S. than AIDS.  Allowing a young child to ride in a shopping cart next to raw meat or poultry raises the risk of bacteria-caused food poisoning to that child.Poultry has been associated with increased risk of cancer at the top of the stomach, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and endometrial cancer. Harvard researchers found poultry consumption to be the food most likely to spur prostate cancer growth. Poultry may be a source of estrogen, which can raise cancer risk, and heterocyclic amines, which are carcinogens. Cooking poultry until it is well done creates carcinogens that also increase the risk of cancer.Avoiding poultry and other animal products appears to help boost one’s mood, reduce toxic metal levels

T-1511	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy/	pregnancy	Toxins in seafood, including mercury—which may be especially high in canned tuna—can present risks during pregnancy, including shorter cerebellums and lower IQ in babies. Many of these pollutants accumulate in the body for years, some taking decades to exit the body. It may be advisable to get tested for mercury before getting pregnant.Exposure during pregnancy to parasites in lamb meat or phthalates in chicken may lead to future problems for baby boys and girls. One study found an association between the development of childhood allergies and higher maternal intake of meat during pregnancy.Eating meat before pregnancy can increase risk for diabetes during pregnancy. Exposure to fumes from grilling meat may adversely affect fetus development. The levels of pesticides on GMO soy is a concern. So far, no human harm has been shown to come from genetically modified Bt corn. Consumption of organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Other risks during pregnancy may be introduced by the consumption of aspartame, spirulina, iodine, domoic acid in tuna, alcohol, licorice, and even avocados, chamomile tea, and flax seeds. Health food store workers may not always recommend pregnancy-safe nutrients. Iron supplements should perhaps only be taken only in the context of iron deficiency anemia. Folic acid and turmeric supplements should not be taken during pregnancy in most cases (although pregnant women should make sure to eat plenty of folate-rich foods). Items that are considered safe to consume during pregnancy include peanuts, cranberry juice, and moderate amounts of caffeine. A vegan diet lacking vitamin B12 is dangerous for mother and fetus. Vegan women have fewer twins than vegetarians and omnivores.	-	women's health,plant-based diets,poultry,hormones,meat,heart health,obesity,supplements,vegans,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular

T-1518	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/preservatives/	preservatives	Preservatives can differ in their potential health impact. Citric acid is an example of a preservative that is not considered harmful. However, with many preservatives, we must weigh potential benefits and risks. For example, potassium sorbate, a preservative used to prevent mold growth in certain foods and supplements, may be harmful. Nitrites as a preservative in processed meats help reduce botulism risk but also raise cancer risk (see also here) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk. The preservative BHA may be a carcinogen. Sodium benzoate, a preservative often found in soft drinks, can combine with ascorbic acid in the drink to form the carcinogen, benzene. Sodium benzoate has also been linked with hyperactivity.Phosphate additives in chicken can both stiffen arteries and appear to dramatically increase the growth of food poisoning Campylobacter bacteria. Phosphorus preservatives and additives in junk foods, meat products, and cola can also be harmful by possibly damaging blood vessels, accelerating the aging process, and contributing to osteoporosis. Yet, the meat industry is not required to list phosphorus content on the nutrition facts label. In this case, reducing our intake of meat, junk food, fast food, and processed cheese, all of which have redily absorbed phosphorus, may help lower intake until labeling is mandated. Some studies found that a 21-day whole plant-food diets without preservatives helped improve several metabolic and cardiovascular disease markers.	-	meat,heart health,heart disease,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,food additives,cancer,vegans,plant-based diets,vegetarians,poultry,processed foods,chicken,mortality,animal products	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/21/the-real-paleo-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/14/what-do-meat-purge-and-cola-have-in-common/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/21/where-are-phosphate-additives-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/20/uric-acid-caused-by-meat-and-sugar/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/16/phosphate-additives-in-chicken-banned-elsewhere/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowel-wars-hydrogen-sulfide-vs-butyrate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-citric-acid-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-hyperactivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-c-enriched-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/miocene-meteorites-and-uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-nitrates-pollutants-or-nutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-industry-reaction-new-cancer-guidelines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biblical-daniel-fast-put-to-the-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bacon-good-or-is-spinach-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-potassium-sorbate-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-citric-acid-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-hyperactivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/miocene-meteorites-and-uric-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biblical-daniel-fast-put-to-the-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-potassium-sorbate-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/	
T-1523	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pritikin/	Pritikin	Along with the work of Dr. Dean Ornish and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, research from engineer, Nathan Pritikin has shown that plant-based diets can both stop heart disease and even, in a majority of patients, reverse it (see also here, here). Pritikin began reversing heart disease with low-fat, whole food plant-based diets back in the 1970s. Plant-based diets may also reduce benign prostate cell growth and even help reverse cancer growth by lowering circulating IGF1 levels. Combining such diets with exercise may be even more effective in trying to treat cancer.	-	plant-based diets,vegetarians,vegans,cancer,in vitro studies,exercise,heart disease,cardiovascular health,meat,cholesterol,standard American diet,mortality,cardiovascular disease,Dr. Dean Ornish,women's health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/06/how-to-prevent-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/15/the-natural-human-diet/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-story-of-nutritionfacts-org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resuscitating-medicare/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-a-plant-based-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resuscitating-medicare/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/Engineering a Cure,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-a-plant-based-diet/	
T-1524	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/probiotics/	probiotics	Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts, and may be beneficial to our health, especially our gastrointestinal tracts. Probiotics may reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and help boost the immune system. They may also help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and speed recovery from acute gastroenteritis. One study found that a month of probiotics can significantly decrease anxiety, depression, anger and hostility symptoms. Lactobacillus probiotics may help with childhood asthma.Probiotic bacterial survival is likely best when provided within 30 minutes before or simultaneously with a meal or beverage that has some fat.  While taking probiotic supplements may boost beneficial bacteria, eating a plant-based diet will do so as well.	-	gut flora,microbiome,bile acids,colon health,plant-based diets,fiber,fruit,obesity,vegetarians,vegans,antibiotics,immune function,vegetables,allergies,cancer	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/07/how-probiotics-affect-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/26/probiotics-and-diarrhea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/23/how-a-gluten-free-diet-can-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/31/probiotics-during-cold-season/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/02/how-should-i-take-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/10/boosting-gut-flora-without-probiotics/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-kimchi-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-kombucha-tea-goodfor-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-become-a-fecal-transplant-super-donor/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gluten-free-diets-separating-the-wheat-from-the-chat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-good-bacteria-in-the-colon-without-probiotics/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-flora-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-good-bacteria-in-the-colon-without-probiotics/	
T-1525	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-foods/	processed foods	The typical American diet is high in processed foods. Regularly eating a significant amount of processed foods may be detrimental to our health. In order to sell processed food, industries may fund research that ultimately can misinform the public. Processing can remove nutrients from grains and even tea. Processing may remove fiber, leaving relatively empty calories with low nutrient value. Processed food intake also seems linked to higher blood pressure. A much better choice is to eat unrefined plant foods (especially a varied plant-based diet).Processed foods may be harmful to one’s health, including carrot juice, coconut milk, coconut oil, mangosteen juice, white bread, corn syrup, sugar, and sodas. Use of the artificial sweetener aspartame has been linked to neurological and behavioral disturbances in sensitive individuals. However, two sweeteners do have significant antioxidant content.Some processed foods have health benefits, including peanut butter, blueberry jam, homemade cranberry “juice,” apple juice, grape juice, soy products (but not tofu from Indonesia processed with formaldehyde), popcorn (but not with butter flavor), and cocoa (but not chocolate). Gum Arabic can be considered harmless.Processed foods often contain additives, preservatives, and other chemical ingredients. Avoiding processed food additives like polysorbate 80 may help reduce risk for Crohn’s disease. The food coloring, Red dye #3, often added to processed foods, may be linked to increased thyroid cancer risk (see also here). Artificial food dyes overall in processed foods may increase inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity among young children (see also here). Sticking largely with whole, plant-based foods is a good way to avoid aluminum compounds that may be added to processed foods. Processed cheeses often contain such additives. For those experiencing gluten sensitivity symptoms, avoiding processed foods may help. Research has found that the intake of processed, fried, and stir-fried meat is linked to increased breast tissue DNA mutations. Nitrites used in processed meats are considered carcinogenic. An NIH-AARP study found nitrites associated with increased kidney cancer risk.In November 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced plans to eliminate trans fats, linked to heart disease risk, from processed foods. When preparing meals at home, minimizing use of commercially processed foods is likely helpful. Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed care organization in the U.S., published a nutritional update for their physicians suggesting that healthy eating may be best achieved with a whole, plant-based diet that discourages animal foods as well as all refined and processed foods.	-	plant-based diets,smoking,meat,vegans,fruit,cancer,industry influence,vegetarians,sugar,diabetes,cardiovascular

T-1526	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/processed-meat/	processed meat	The American Institute for Cancer Research defines processed meat as “meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives.” Cured meats like bacon, hot dogs and cold cuts have been linked to increased cancer risk overall and breast cancer in particular. A key factor may be the nitrites that are often added as a preservative in processed meats to combat the threat of botulism.  When processed in the stomach, these nitrates become carcinogenic nitrosamines and nitrosamides. Hot dog intake has been linked with two leading pediatric cancers, brain tumors, and childhood leukemia.Processed meat also appears linked to long-term weight gain.  Intake of processed and other meats before pregnancy may raise the risk of gestational diabetes and may play a role in infertility and in early-onset puberty in girls. Cured meat consumption appears to be linked to risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, known as COPD. Processed meats may also contribute to aging, possibly by reducing our protective DNA telomeres.	-	meat,cancer,bacon,hot dogs,heart disease,smoking,cardiovascular disease,deli meat,carcinogens,animal fat,industry influence,standard American diet,cardiovascular health,ham,chicken	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/07/virus-in-chicken-could-be-linked-to-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/16/what-is-meat-glue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/26/how-to-protect-our-telomeres-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/13/is-titanium-dioxide-in-food-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/08/eat-protect-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/21/where-are-phosphate-additives-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/18/what-is-actually-in-chicken-nuggets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/10/food-dyes-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/10/25/what-should-women-eat-to-live-longest/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-cancer-does-lunch-meat-cause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-industry-reaction-new-cancer-guidelines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infectobesity-adenovirus-36-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bacon-good-or-is-spinach-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-miso-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-meat-glue-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-palatability-of-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-is-meat-a-risk-factor-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-salt-getting-to-the-meat-of-the-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phip-the-three-strikes-breast-carcinogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-percent-of-americans-lead-healthy-lifestyles/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/telomeres-cap-it-all-off-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/autopsy-of-chicken-nuggets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-cancer-does-lunch-meat-cause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-industry-reaction-new-cancer-guidelines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infectobesity-adenovirus-36-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bacon-good-or-is-spinach-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/	
T-1532	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer/	prostate cancer	For American men, prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Lifestyle habits appear to be important in both preventing and treating prostate cancer, and a plant-based diet, especially when combined with moderate exercise, may be helpful as part of such a program.Total meat consumption and processed meat intake appear to be linked to increased risk for cancer, including prostate cancer.  Other diet-related prostate cancer risk factors include deep-fried food consumption, dairy intake, and egg consumption.  Dioxins and alkylphenols that may be in animal foods, cooked meat carcinogens and multivitamin use may also raise prostate cancer risk.When men with active prostate cancer eat a plant-based diet, or even reduce the ratio of animal to plant protein, their cancer progression appears to slow. One way a plant-based diet seems to help is by reducing the amount of excess hormones entering the body.  Heavy soy consumption, defined as seven or more daily servings a day, should be avoided, since research shows levels of IGF-1 are comparable to those eating meat. Too much IGF-1 may be linked with cancer cell spread. Restricting the amino acid methionine by lowering animal food intake may help control prostate cancer cell growth. Suppressing the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) enzyme by reducing intake of leucine–rich animal products such as milk may reduce overall risk for cancer, including prostate cancer.Phytates, found in beans, grains, nuts, and seeds, appear to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells.  Vegetables in the cruciferous and allium families and other phytonutrient-rich foods may prevent and inhibit cancer cell growth. In terms of specific foods and beverages, all of the following appear to be associated with reducing the risks of or slowing the growth of prostate cancer:	-	cancer,men's health,plant-based

The occurrence of prostate cancer may also decrease if the following items are restricted in the diet: the amino acid methionine, choline and cows’ milk. Benign prostatic hypertrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may be less of a natural consequence of aging, and more indicative of eating an unhealthy diet and not exercising enough. The same kinds of healthy lifestyle interventions that have been shown to be effective at reducing the occurrence of prostate cancer are also helpful in keeping BPH in check.	-	men's health,prostate cancer,cancer,meat,plant-based diets,mortality,cancer survival,vegetarians,vegetables,breast cancer,inflammation,women's health,vegans,metastases,breast health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/08/a-low-methionine-diet-may-help-starve-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/17/organic-milk-and-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/21/why-the-egg-cancer-link/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/19/why-are-eggs-linked-to-cancer-progression/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/03/flaxseeds-for-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/24/cancer-and-the-animal-to-plant-protein-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/was-it-the-flaxseed-fat-restriction-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-kimchi-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-choline-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-sex-hormone-binding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saturated-fat-cancer-progression-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic%20milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseeds-vs-chia-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hot-dogs-leukemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-rehabilitating-cancer-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-vs-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-and-botulism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-licorice-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-prostates-are-larger-than-others/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/acne-cancer-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-mans-diet-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/multivitamin-supplements-and-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-prostate-cancer-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/red-tea-honeybush-chamomile-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-a-plant-based-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/was-it-the-flaxseed-fat-restriction-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic%20milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-to-our-roots-curry-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-choline-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-vs-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/prostate-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-survival-the-av-ratio/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/	
T-1535	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/protein/	protein	As pointed out by the Chair of Harvard’s Nutrition department, plant protein is preferable to animal protein because food is a package deal. Plant protein has been associated with lower rates of heart disease and lower cholesterol.Plant protein tends to be relatively low in methionine, an amino acid associated with premature aging and cancer. It also tends to also be relatively lower in the amino acid leucine, which may accelerate aging via the enzyme TOR. Diets high in animal protein tend to be acid forming, while diets centered around plant protein tend to be alkalizing.Animal protein may also increases insulin levels and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, impair artery function, and increase the risk of colon cancer. Reducing the ratio of animal to plant protein in men’s diets may also slow the progression of prostate cancer. Animal protein triggers the release of the cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1, apparently because the ratios of amino acids in animal proteins more closely resembles our own. This amino acid profile may also be one reason why animal protein is linked to heart disease and inflammatory arthritis. While animal proteins increase levels of IGF-1, and replacing with plant proteins brings levels down, “high quality” plant proteins such as soy may not significantly affect levels in either direction, although consuming 7-18 servings of soy foods a day may result circulating IGF-1 levels comparable to animal protein. To be safe, one one should probably eat no more than 3-5 servings of soy foods a day. Plant-based diets may be more effective at lowering IGF-1 levels than even strict caloric restriction.The animal protein present in cow’s milk infant formula may be linked to childhood obesity later in life. Animal protein sources may also contain hormones and other endocrine disrupting chemicals linked to early puberty in girls and fertility issues in women; Neu5Gc, a foreign meat molecule associated with inflammation and heart disease; and saturated fat and cholesterol, which may explain why plant-based low carb diets don’t appear to have the same associated risks as meat-based low carb diets.Beans, canned, sprouted, or dry, are included in the USDA Dietary Guidelines as a serving option for both the protein and vegetable categories. Gluten, the wheat protein found in many meat substitutes such as veggie chicken, and veggie hot dogs is another healthful source of protein for most people. Surprising to many, the USDA doesn’t allow eggs to be advertised as high in protein.On average, people who eat a plant-based diet have significantly higher levels of protein plasma in their blood. In fact, vegetarians and vegans get 70% more protein than the required daily intake. Raw food diets may be deficient in protein, however, among other nutrients.	-	meat,dairy,diabetes,milk,women's health,prediabetes,insulin,type 1 diabetes,animal products,autoimmune

T-1565	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/radiation/	radiation	Long-term UV radiation exposure may increase cataract risk. Radiation exposure from dental X-rays may be associated with an increased risk of brain tumor.  Radiation from pediatric CAT scans may also raise cancer risk. Most human exposure to polonium, a radioactive element, comes from fish and seafood. The meat industry has used radiation to reduce risk of food-borne illness. Critics of the use of radiation to help sterilize meat suggest the practice allows industry to become more complacent about food safety.Research indicates that ginger and lemon balm may help provide some protection against radiation.  Also, fruit and vegetable intake may decrease radiation-induced chromosome damage.Dr. Dean Ornish was able to use a plant-based diet, without any surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, to reduce prostate cancer progression.	-	cancer,fish,fruit,medications,mortality,smoking,plant-based diets,meat,X-rays,antioxidants,animal products,vegetarians,brain health,industry influence,poultry	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/31/does-orange-aromatherapy-reduce-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/28/dr-gregers-natural-nausea-remedy-recipe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/20/dealing-with-air-travel-radiation-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/25/ginger-lemon-balm-for-radiation-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/13/how-risky-are-ct-scans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/18/are-dental-x-rays-safe/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/strawberries-versus-esophageal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-cell-phones-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/foodborne-illness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ginger,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/	
T-1568	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/raisins/	raisins	Raisins, though not as rich in phytonutrients as some dried fruits, can still be considered a healthy snack with a variety of positive health benefits.Raisins, in particular currants and golden raisins, are a good source of anti-inflammatory antioxidants. They are also rich in fiber, which promotes satiety and may decrease total calorie consumption when consumed before a calorie-rich meal. Fiber also promotes growth of healthy bacteria in our large intestines, which supports our immune system and helps prevent infections. This may be particularly helpful for pregnant women to prevent pre-term labor, which is thought to be at least partially triggered by inflammation. An abundance of healthy gut bacteria may also help decrease blood cholesterol and may be why raisin consumption has been shown to be able to lower LDL cholesterol up to 13%, though this effect could also be mediated through some other phytonutrient found in grape-flesh or skin. Finally, raisins are rich in simple sugars, which may be useful for endurance athletes trying to enhance their performance during races.Concerns that sugar-rich and chewy-textured raisins might promote cavities have been widely discussed in the medical community for several decades. While recent studies have indicated that acids and sugars from fruits and fruit juices may indeed soften tooth enamel, cavity formation is not driven by acidity alone, but by bacterial activity as well. Phytonutrients in raisins appear to inhibit cavity-promoting activity in oral bacteria. In addition, raisin residue is removed much more quickly from teeth surfaces than many other foods, such as chips, crackers or cookies.	-	fruit,dried fruit,plant-based diets,industry influence,grapes,heart health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,vegetables,candy,junk food,women's health,fatigue,berries,soda	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/13/are-raisins-a-good-snack-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/17/amla-indian-gooseberries-versus-cancer-diabetes-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/24/raisins-vs-energy-gels-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/13/foods-for-computer-eye-strain/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-raisins-good-snacks-for-kids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatments-for-computer-eye-strain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-raisins-cause-cavities/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garlic-and-raisins-to-prevent-premature-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raisins-vs-jelly-beans-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-raisin-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/potato-chips/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dried-fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/golden-raisins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cookies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/appetite/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grapes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/athletes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/currants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gut-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cavities/	
T-1573	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/raw-food/	raw food	There is evidence that raw food diets may be inadequate in many dietary aspects. In one study, vitamin B-carotene levels were higher in subjects who ate seven servings a day of both raw and cooked vegetables, as opposed to 14 servings a day of purely raw vegetables. Gerson therapy, an alternative cancer treatment that includes a mostly raw diet, resulted in a quicker death than chemotherapy for cancer patients. On the other hand, raw plant-based diets reduced symptoms in fibromyalgia patients, though this is likely to be more attributed to the plant-based aspect of the diet as opposed to the raw aspect (see here and here).There are a few instances where plant enzymes affect us physiologically, such as the formation of sulforaphane in broccoli (see also here and here). In these instances it may be beneficial to eat the broccoli raw or to chop it before cooking, since the enzyme is inactivated by cooking.Different cooking methods also affect the nutrient profile of foods. Steamed and microwaved foods can actually be more nutritious than their raw counterparts, particularly in regards to their bile-acid binding ability. On the other hand, boiling and pressure cooking causes nutrients to become lost in the cooking water. There are exceptions, however, since boiled kale was found to have higher immunostimulatory effects than raw kale. Carrots and celery become more nutritious when cooked apparently no matter what method you use. Artichokes, beets, onions and asparagus retain their nutrients in any cooking method as well. It appears the only vegetable that is always best to eat raw is bell peppers. Raw fruits are great, but you may want to rinse your mouth out with water to prevent dental erosion after consuming acidic fruits such as tomatoes or oranges.	-	plant-based diets,cooking methods,antioxidants,vegetables,vegans,vegetarians,cancer,brain disease,fruit,brain health,mortality,carrots,fatigue,reversing chronic disease,chronic diseases	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/03/sprouted-lentils-healthier-canned-lentils/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/liver-toxicity-due-to-broccoli-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-and-onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/migratory-skin-worms-from-sushi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-green-smoothies-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-veggies-versus-cooked-for-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cooked-beans-or-sprouted-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biggest-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kale-and-the-immune-system/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-broccoli-and-bladder-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-a-neutropenic-diet-necessary-for-cancer-patients/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-vegetable-binds-bile-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kale-and-the-immune-system/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-broccoli-and-bladder-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-diet-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/

T-1576	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/rectal-cancer/	rectal cancer	Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States, behind lung cancer.  At least 70% of colon cancer cases are avoidable. Numerous studies suggest that a plant-based diet may be beneficial in the prevention, treatment, and even reversal of cancer.Heterocyclic amines, carcinogens created by cooking muscle tissue, are associated with colon cancer, as are dangerous compounds called nitrosamines found in cured meats. Too much iron in the body, especially the type of iron that comes from meat, may also increase the risk of colon cancer. Animal protein consumption is associated with an increase in a cancer-promoting growth hormone called IGF-1. High saturated fat from animal products stimulates elevated levels of bile acids, which have been shown to be cancer-causing. When animal protein putrefies in the colon, ammonia is produced, which is associated with cancer risk. Poultry and other animal products contain viruses that are known to cause cancer in animals and may be passed to humans. Additionally, dioxins in fish and eggs may contribute to colon cancer risk.The rarity of colon cancer in Africans is attributable to very low animal-product consumption. The significantly lower pH in the colon resulting from a plant-based diet helps lower the risk of colon cancer. Specific protective foods include beans, berries (including Indian gooseberries and organic strawberries), broccoli, black beans, a number of herbal varieties of tea, carob, coffee, apples, turmeric, cranberries, sweet potatoes, nuts, and lemon rind and seeds. Vitamin D may also play a role in preventing colon cancer. The kind of “resistant starch” that comes from plant foods like cooked beans, peas, lentils, and raw oatmeal—can block the accumulation of potentially harmful byproducts of animal-protein metabolism in the colon. 	-	colon cancer,cancer,vegetables,fruit,women's health,breast cancer,plant-based diets,mortality,beans,vegetarians,colon health,meat,standard American diet,heart

T-1580	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/red-meat/	red meat	Red meat consumption has been associated with an increased risk of total mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and cancer mortality. On average, there are 64 times more antioxidants in plant foods than animal foods. The animal protein in meat may even have a pro-oxidant effect. Because food is a package deal, the nutrients in products such as beef cannot be obtained without cholesterol, saturated fat, and hormones. Red meat also contains carnitine, which can ultimately leads to the buildup of TMAO circulating throughout our bloodstream. TMAO increases the buildup of cholesterol in the inflammatory cells in the atherosclerotic plaques in our arteries, which is associated with a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. Another risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and death is choline, found primarily in eggs, milk, fish, liver, poultry and red meat.Meat appears to actually speed up the aging process by contributing to the loss of  the telomere caps of our DNA and through the presence of AGEs (thought to likewise speed up the aging process). Vegetarians report less negative emotions than omnivores, possibly due to the inflammatory omega-6 arachidonic acid in meat. The injections of U.S. cattle with anabolic steroids appear to make their way into the meat and have been tentatively linked with increased hormone dependent cancer levels. The sex steroid hormones in beef may affect the development of pregnant women’s son’s genitals in the womb. Meat intake has also been associated with women’s infertility and dementia. Tick-bite induced meat allergies may help explain idiopathic hives in children. Pancreatic cancer has been linked to intake of animal fat (including beef fat), though red meat is still better than poultry. Acute myeloid leukemia as well as other types of leukemia have been associated with meat intake.In terms of fecal contamination, beef tends to be safer than chicken because the skin of cows is not eaten. Red meat is safer than white meat and fish in regards to flame retardant chemical contamination and safer than chicken and fish in terms of methionine amounts, which have been found to stimulate the growth of cancer cells. It is also poses a lower risk for prostate cancer than poultry, eggs, and refined grains, as well as a lower diabetes risk than fish (see also here) and 40% less weight gain than poultry. Red meat is riskier than white meat for colon cancer. PCBs are found in highest concentrations in fish and eggs, milk and milk products, and meat and meat products from land based animals, in that order. Finally, fast food burgers have been found to contain the following: blood vessels, nerves, cartilage, and only 2.1%-14.8% meat.	-	meat,chicken,poultry,animal

T-1582	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/red-wine/	red wine	For years, red wine enjoyed a popular reputation as an anti-aging remedy, but extensive research has proven that this may not be the case. Some scientists conducting red wine studies have admitted to falsifying and fabricating data.There has been promising evidence in rodents using resveratrol supplements, a component found in red wine. In rodents, these supplements decreased cardiovascular risk factors, improved cardiovascular function and decreased inflammation.When this same study was done on humans, the results were not so favorable. In fact, the opposite results occurred in a study of exercise and resveratrol; the supplements were shown to increase arterial constriction and decrease oxygen intake. Non-alcoholic red wine, however, has been shown to improve arterial function, which leads to some to conclude that it may be the grapes that have the beneficial effect. This may also be the case with claims that red wine might help prevent breast cancer.   	-	alcohol,wine,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,vegetables,cardiovascular health,heart health,fruit,cancer,weight loss,saturated fat,antioxidants,beans,meat,animal products	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/22/preventing-and-treating-colon-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/28/breast-cancer-alcohol-how-much-is-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/09/what-to-eat-to-reduce-our-toxic-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/23/role-caffeine-artery-function/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resveratrol-impairs-exercise-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-consumption-and-suicide/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vinegar-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-rye-bread-protect-against-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-on-the-mediterranean-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-colon-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-risk-red-wine-vs-white-wine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-explains-the-french-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-vinegar-help-with-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/benzene-in-carrot-juice/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/resveratrol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cardiovascular-health/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/inflammation/	
T-1585	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/reductionism/	reductionism	Nutritional reductionism refers to a focus on individual food compounds (e.g., protein, vitamins, antioxidants) as opposed to a holistic approach that focuses on food habits and the relationship between diet and health.  Reductionism is common in nutritional research and also in food and supplement production and marketing.A “deficiency mentality” related to disease—i.e., that a disease is caused by a lack of a particular compound—supports a reductionist philosophy. Diseases such as scurvy have been treated successfully with vitamin extracts. Thus scientists and doctors are trained to find the “magic bullet” to cure a disease, an approach that is not successful in treating modern chronic diseases.Another motivation for reductionism in nutrition research is that there are billions of dollars to be made in the supplement industry. At least 5,000 phytonutrients in plants have been discovered so far linked to the possibility of decreasing risk of major chronic diseases. The supplement industry can make money selling individual compounds; whole foods do not offer the same profit potential.Studies show that eating a variety of whole plant foods increases the positive nutritional benefits above the sum of the individual plant components. Pills cannot mimic the effects of plant food nutrient synergies. Further, components in plant foods extracted out individually may lose their bioavailability or behave differently than when naturally contained in the plants.There are many examples showing the failure of the reductionist approach in nutritional research, including:	-	supplements,cancer,heart health,fruit,vegetables,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,chronic diseases,phytonutrients,diabetes,beta carotene,berries,carrots,beans	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beta-carotene/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/resistant-starch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nutrient-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-t-colin-campbell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/bioavailability/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-e/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-c/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/turmeric/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chronic-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/scurvy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/marketing/	
T-1586	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/american-heart-association/	Videos Referencing the American Heart Association	The American Heart Association (AHA) advocates dietary and lifestyle changes for preventing heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions, and agree that these changes may be as effective or even better than medications. They came up with seven simple recommendations for lifestyle changes and have set modest goals for getting more Americans to practice them.Some dietary modifications the AHA recommends include decreasing salt, trans fat, saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol consumption and increasing the intake and variety of fruits and vegetables. They also recognize a link between prolonged sitting and increased mortality and advocate for daily exercise.	-	heart health,cardiovascular health,cardiovascular disease,heart disease,plant-based diets,fruit,vegans,cholesterol,vegetarians,vegetables,high blood pressure,blood pressure,mortality,hypertension,stroke	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/06/do-you-meet-the-simple-seven/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/28/fighting-inflammation-with-food-synergy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/23/the-five-most-important-dietary-tweaks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/18/dietary-cholesterol-affects-blood-cholesterol-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/29/butter-is-back/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/05/the-reversal-on-fish-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/06/egg-industry-caught-making-false-claims/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/19/much-added-sugar-much/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-percent-of-americans-lead-healthy-lifestyles/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-meet-the-simple-seven/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-versus-drugs-for-high-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/standing-up-for-your-health/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-percent-of-americans-lead-healthy-lifestyles/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-meet-the-simple-seven/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-versus-drugs-for-high-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/standing-up-for-your-health/	
T-1590	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/reproductive-health/	reproductive health	Just one serving of meat a day may increase a woman’s risk of anovulatory infertility by 30% (or 50% in the case of poultry). Furthermore, the sex steroid hormones in meat and the endocrine-disrupting pollutant in fish may affect the development of male genital organs while still in the womb, consequently decreasing their fertility later in life.Male infertility accounts for half of the 10%-15% of couples who have trouble conceiving. Evidence suggests soy protein does not affect male fertility. Soy may, however, decrease sperm concentration because it may increase total ejaculate volume, but has no effect on total sperm count. On the other hand, meat and cheese appear to lower sperm counts and semen quality on account of steroids, saturated fat, dioxins, and other pollutants in the meat supply, though omega-3’s (like those found in walnuts) appear to improve sperm vitality, movement, and shape. Vegetarian men were found to have higher sperm counts than fish eaters, most likely due to the xenoestrogens present in fish. Seafood might also affect male fertility by increasing radioactive polonium levels in semen, though more research still needs to be done to determine how much seafood must be consumed for the effects to become clinically relevant. Pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant may want to reduce their fish intake to less than what the FDA considers safe due to the mercury and other pollutants in fish, which can increase a person’s risk of developing diabetes. Women who eat eggs or meat are significantly more likely to develop gestational diabetes while pregnant.Dairy is perhaps the richest source of estrogens in our diet, attributed to the fact that most milk these days comes from pregnant cows. These estrogens appear to lower testosterone levels in males while simultaneously upping their estrogen levels. But it’s not just dairy – animal protein in general appears to contribute to the recent trend of earlier onset puberty, whereas soy milk may help normalize development. The endocrine-disrupting industrial chemicals that build up in meat may be another cause for earlier sexual development. Monsanto’s Roundup may have hormonal effects, though the science on the topic is still clouded by industry bias.	-	men's health,women's health,hormones,meat,organic foods,pregnancy,sperm counts,pesticides,industrial pollutants,dairy,Europe,fish,cancer,animal products,PCBs	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/23/preventing-bacterial-vaginosis-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/16/dietary-estrogens-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/14/role-diet-declining-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/07/monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/23/why-would-eating-fish-increase-diabetes-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/28/gmos-safe-case-bt-corn/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/11/exploiting-autophagy-to-live-longer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury-before-considering-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-diet-in-declining-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-hormones-male-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-pollutants-may-affect-testosterone-levels/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-long-to-detox-from-fish-before-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury-before-considering-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-diet-in-declining-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-fertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soymilk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-hormones-male-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-early-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/poultry,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/semen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/seafood,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/FDA,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fertility,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-vegan-women-have-5x-fewer-twins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/xenoestrogens-sperm-counts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/walnuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/male-fertility-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-monsantos-roundup-pesticide-glyphosate-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty-and-pollutants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/Soy	
T-1592	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/respiratory-infections/	respiratory infections	A respiratory infection occurs when respiratory epithelium lining the upper and/or lower tract are overcome by a virus, bacteria, or fungus.  Upper respiratory infection is usually not serious, like the common “cold” or sinus infection. On the other hand, lower respiratory tract infection may be serious or even life threatening, such as pneumonia where pus fills the air sacs.Things that may increase the risk of respiratory infection are strenuous exercise, asthma, allergies, and immune suppression (i.e., from cancer, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medications).  Recent studies have strongly suggested that children with asthma have fewer flare-ups and steroid usage when they go on a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and grains, and eliminate animal products (meat, fish, dairy, eggs).There are things we can do to protect ourselves from respiratory infection, such as hand washing and avoiding others’ coughing and sneezing fits. Even gargling helps rinse away potential invading organisms.  Other preventative measures are moderate exercise, which may strengthen the respiratory epithelium, and controlling asthma and allergies.	-	immune function,children,allergies,fruit,exercise,plant-based diets,industrial pollutants,vegetarians,vegetables,protein,vegans,cancer,asthma,dairy,eggs	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/04/why-athletes-should-eat-nutritional-yeast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/31/probiotics-during-cold-season/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/16/should-we-take-chlorella-to-boost-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/08/the-best-way-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/06/which-pets-improve-childrens-health/	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/allergies,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pneumonia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gargling/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asthma,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/common-cold,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/children,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat
