Obesity is up, exercise is down, and the number of people eating just five servings of fruits and veggies a day dropped like a rock. And we didn’t start out that great to begin with. Only 3% of Americans at the turn of the 21st century had the following four healthy lifestyle characteristics: not smoking, not overweight, five daily servings of fruits and vegetables, and exercising a half hour a day at least five days a week. Whether people were wealthy or college-educated didn’t matter; no sub-group even remotely met clinical or public health recommendations. Where are people falling down the most? You can see in my video What Percent of Americans Lead Healthy Lifestyles?. If you look at heart disease risk factors, for example, most people don’t smoke and about half are exercising. But if we look at the healthy diet score–which is based on things like drinking less than four cups of soda a week–a scale of zero to five, only about 1% of Americans score a four or five. The American Heart Association’s aggressive 2020 target to improve that by 20% would bring us up to 1.2%. Since we’ve known for decades that advanced coronary artery disease may be present by age 20—with atherosclerosis often even present in young children—it is particularly disturbing that healthy lifestyle choices are declining rather than improving in the U.S. In terms of life expectancy, the U.S. is down around 27 or 28 out of the 34 OECD free-market democracies. The people of Slovenia live a year longer than citizens of the United States. Why? According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published, the number one cause of death and disability in the United States is our diet. It’s the food. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, the worst five things about our diet are: we don’t eat enough fruit, we don’t eat enough nuts and seeds, we eat too much salt, too much processed meat, and not enough vegetables. Studies that have looked at diet quality and chronic disease mortality risk found that those scoring higher (e.g. more whole plant foods), reduced the risk of dying prematurely from heart disease, cancer, and all causes of death combined. There is now an overwhelming body of clinical and epidemiological evidence illustrating the dramatic impact of a healthy lifestyle on reducing all-cause mortality and preventing chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Why do we eat so poorly? Aren’t we scared of dying from these horrible chronic diseases? It’s almost as if we’re eating as though our future didn’t matter. And there’s actually data to back that up, from a study entitled Death Row Nutrition. The growing macabre fascination with speculating about one’s ‘‘last meal’’ offers a window into one’s true consumption desires when one’s value of the future is discounted close to zero. In contrast to pop culture anecdotes, a group of Cornell researchers created a catalog of actual last meals–the final food requests of 247 individuals executed in the United States during a recent five-year period. Meat was the most common request. The researchers go out of their way to note that tofu never made the list, and no one asked for a vegetarian meal. In fact, if you compare the last meals to what Americans normally eat, there’s not much difference. If we continue to eat as though they were our last meals, eventually, they will be. A few years ago I did a video called Nation’s Diet in Crisis. It’s sad that it doesn’t seem like much has changed. How Many Meet the Simple Seven? is another video in which you can see how your own habits stack up. For more on fruits and veggies and living longer, see Fruits and Longevity: How Many Minutes per Mouthful? Surprised that nuts made the longevity list? See Nuts May Help Prevent Death. What about legumes? See Increased Lifespan from Beans. The reason public health professionals are so keen on measuring lifestyle characteristics is because modest improvements may have extraordinary effects. See, for example: Didn’t know the beginnings of heart disease may already be present in children? See my video Heart Disease Starts in Childhood. Think that’s tragic?

A-2	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/21/clostridium-difficile-in-the-food-supply/	Clostridium difficile in the Food Supply	Clostridium difficile is one of our most urgent bacterial threats, sickening a quarter million Americans every year, and killing thousands at the cost of a billion dollars a year. And, it’s on the rise. As shown in C. difficile Superbugs in Meat, uncomplicated cases have been traditionally managed with powerful antibiotics, but recent reports suggest that hypervirulent strains are increasingly resistant to medical management. There’s been a rise in the percentage of cases that end up under the knife, which could be a marker of the emergence of these hypervirulent strains. Surgeons may need to remove our colon entirely to save our lives, although the surgery is so risky that the operation alone may kill us half the time. Historically, most cases appeared in hospitals, but a landmark study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that only about a third of cases could be linked to contact with an infected patient. Another potential source is our food supply. In the US, the frequency of contamination of retail chicken with these superbugs has been documented to be up to one in six packages off of store shelves. Pig-derived C. diff, however, has garnered the greatest attention from public health personnel, because the same human strain that’s increasingly emerging in the community outside of hospitals is the major strain among pigs. Since the turn of the century, C. diff is increasingly being reported as a major cause of intestinal infections in piglets. C. diff is now one of the most common causes of intestinal infections in baby piglets in the US. Particular attention has been paid to pigs because of high rates of C. diff shedding into their waste, which can lead to the contamination of retail pork. The U.S. has the highest levels of C. diff meat contamination tested so far anywhere in the world. Carcass contamination by gut contents at slaughter probably contributes most to the presence of C. diff in meat and meat products. But why is the situation so much worse in the US? Slaughter techniques differ from country-to-country, with those in the United States evidently being more of the “quick and dirty” variety. Colonization or contamination of pigs by superbugs, such as C. difficile and MRSA, at the farm production level may be more important than at the slaughterhouse level, though. One of the reasons sows and their piglets may have such high rates of C. diff is because of cross-contamination of feces in the farrowing crates, which are narrow metal cages that mother pigs are kept in while their piglets are nursing. Can’t you just follow food safety guidelines and cook the meat through? Unfortunately, current food safety guidelines are ineffective against C. difficile. To date, most food safety guidelines recommend cooking to an internal temperature as low as 63o C–the official USDA recommendation for pork–but recent studies show that C. diff spores can survive extended heating at 71o. Therefore, the guidelines should be raised to take this potentially killer infection into account. One of the problems is that sources of C. diff food contamination might include not only fecal contamination on the surface of the meat, but transfer of spores from the gut into the actual muscles of the animal, inside the meat. Clostridia bacteria like C. diff comprise one of the main groups of bacteria involved in natural carcass degradation; and so, by colonizing muscle tissue before death, C. diff can not only transmit to new hosts, like us, that eat the muscles, but give themselves a head start on carcass break-down. Never heard of C. diff? That’s the Toxic Megacolon Superbug I’ve talked about before. Another foodborne illness tied to pork industry practices is yersiniosis. See Yersinia in Pork. MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staph aureus) is another so-called superbug in the meat supply: More on the scourge of antibiotic resistance and what can be done about it: How is it even legal to sell foods with such pathogens?

A-3	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/16/how-milk-may-contribute-to-childhood-obesity/	How Milk May Contribute to Childhood Obesity	We’ve known that breastfed infants may be protected against obesity later in life for more than 30 years, but why? It may be the formula. Giving infants formula based on cow’s milk presents an unusual situation. Cow’s milk is designed to put nearly two pounds a day onto a growing calf, 40 times the growth rate of human infants (see Formula for Childhood Obesity). The perfect food for humans, finely tuned over millions of years, is human breast milk. Remarkably, among all mammalian species, the protein content of human milk is the lowest. The excessive protein content of cow’s milk-based formula is thought to be what sets the child up for obesity later in life. And then, instead of being weaned, we continue to drink milk. The question, thus, arises as to whether consumption of a growth-promoting substance from another species throughout childhood fundamentally alters processes of human growth and maturation. A study out of Indiana University, for example, found evidence that greater milk intake is associated with an increased risk of premature puberty; girls drinking a lot of milk started to get their periods earlier. Thus, cross-species milk consumption and ingestion into childhood may trigger unintended consequences. Only human milk allows appropriate metabolic programming and protects against diseases of civilization in later life, whereas consumption of cow’s milk and other dairy products during adolescence and adulthood is an evolutionarily novel behavior that may have long-term adverse effects on human health. Teens exposed to dairy proteins, such as casein, skim milk, or whey, experienced a significant increase in BMI and waist circumference compared to a control group. In contrast, not a single study funded by the dairy industry found a result unfavorable to milk. The head of the Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children’s Hospital and the chair of Harvard’s nutrition department wrote an editorial recently to the AMA’s Pediatrics journal questioning the role of cow’s milk in human nutrition. They stated the obvious: humans have no requirement for other animal’s milk; in fact, dairy may play a role in certain cancers due to the high levels of reproductive hormones in the U.S. milk supply.

A-4	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/14/how-much-fiber-should-you-eat-every-day/	How Much Fiber Should You Eat Every Day?	High dietary fiber intake may help prevent strokes. The belief that dietary fiber intake is protectively associated with certain diseases was postulated 40 years ago and then enormously fueled and kept alive by a great body of science since. Today, it is generally believed that eating lots of fiber-rich foods helps prevent obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases such as stroke. Strokes are the second most common cause of death worldwide. Moreover, stroke is a leading cause of disability, and so preventing strokes in the first place—what’s called primary prevention—should, therefore, be a key public health priority (see How to Prevent a Stroke). The best observational studies to date found that fiber appears to significantly protect against the risk of stroke. Different strokes for different folks, depending, evidently, on how much fiber they ate. Notably, increasing fiber just seven grams a day was associated with a 7% reduction in stroke risk. And seven grams is easy, that’s like a serving of whole grain pasta with tomato sauce and an apple. What’s the mechanism? Maybe it’s that fiber helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Or, it could just be that those eating more fiber are just eating more vegetables, or fewer calories, or less meat and fat, or improving digestion, all of which may slim us down and lower our blood pressure and the amount of inflammation in our bodies. Does it really matter, though? As Dr. Burkitt commented on the biblical passage, “A man scatters seed on the land—the seed sprouts and opens—how, he does not know;” the farmers don’t wait to find out. Had the farmers postponed sowing until they understood seed germination, they would not have lasted very long. So yes, let’s keep trying to figure out why fiber is protective, but in the meanwhile, we should be increasing our intake of fiber, which is to say increasing our intake of whole plant foods. It’s never too early to start eating healthier. Strokes are one of many complications of arterial stiffness. Though our first stroke might not happen until our 50’s, our arteries may have been stiffening for decades leading up to it. Hundreds of kids were followed for 24 years, from age 13 up through 36 and researchers found that  lower intake of fiber during a young age was associated with stiffening of the arteries leading up to the brain. Even by age 13, they could see differences in arterial stiffness depending on diet. Fiber intake is important at any age. Again, it doesn’t take much. One extra apple a day or an extra quarter cup of broccoli might translate into meaningful differences in arterial stiffness in adulthood. If you really don’t want a stroke, we should try to get 25 grams a day of soluble fiber (found concentrated in beans, oats, nuts, and berries) and 47 grams a day of insoluble fiber (concentrated in whole grains). One would have to eat an extraordinarily healthy diet to get that much, yet these cut-off values could be considered as the minimum recommended daily intake of soluble and insoluble fiber to prevent stroke. The researchers admit these are higher than those commonly and arbitrarily proposed as “adequate” levels by scientific societies, but should we care  about what authorities think is practical? They should just share the best scienceand let us make up our own minds. Someone funded by Kellogg’s wrote in to complain that in practice, such fiber intakes are “unachievable” and that the message should just be the more, the better—like maybe just have a bowl of cereal or something. The real Dr. Kellogg was actually one of our most famous physicians, credited for being one of the first to sound the alarm about smoking, and who may have been the first American physician to have recognized the field of nutrition as a science. He would be rolling in his grave today if he knew what his family’s company had become.  More on preventing strokes can be found here: More on the wonders of fiber in: It really is never too early to start eating healthier.

A-5	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/03/07/deep-breathing-exercise-for-nausea/	Deep Breathing Exercise for Nausea	One of the most common fears patients express when facing surgery is postoperative nausea, which can range from minor queasiness to protracted periods of vomiting. Feeling sick to one’s stomach and throwing up after surgery is a common problem, affecting between a quarter and a half of those placed under general anesthesia, and more than half of those at high risk (women who don’t smoke and have a history of motion sickness). I’ve explored the science behind treating nausea with ginger (see Natural Nausea Remedy Recipe), but if you’re too nauseous to eat, what do you do? Well, people are often sent home with anti-nausea rectal suppositories. Surveys, however, show that cultural and sexual attitudes may make a number of people sensitive to anything involving the rectum. Though the wording of the question researchers asked was, “are you happy to have a drug put in your back passage?” I can imagine many of the respondents thinking “well, maybe I wouldn’t so much mind, but wouldn’t exactly be happy about it,” especially when you’re feeling sick and throwing up. For women who’ve had a C-section, they might not want to take drugs at all if they’re breastfeeding; so, researchers decided to put aromatherapy to the test. Research has shown that essential oils of both spearmint and peppermint are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy, but this was after swallowing them. Would just the smell of peppermint help with nausea? I explore this in my video Peppermint Aromatherapy for Nausea. Researchers had women take deep whiffs of peppermint extract (like you’d buy at a store) and it seemed to work. Eighty percent of the mint-sniffers felt better within just a few minutes, compared to no improvement in the placebo group who sniffed water with green food coloring, or the control group who didn’t sniff anything. The study was criticized for being small and for not using pure peppermint oil. Peppermint extract is peppermint oil plus alcohol. Maybe it was the smell of alcohol that made people better? And, that’s actually not too much of a stretch. In 1997, researchers reported a simple, innocuous, and inexpensive treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting—the smell of isopropyl alcohol, which is what is found in those alcohol wipes, the little prep pads that nurses swab you with before shots. They found that they could just effectively tear one open and wave it under someone’s nose and relieve nausea and vomiting in more than 80% of folks after surgery. It has since been shown to work as well as a leading anti-nausea drug, and may even work faster, cutting nausea in half within 10 to 15 minutes, rather than 20 or 25. So, was it the alcohol, the peppermint, or both? Researchers decided to put it to the test. They instructed patients to take three slow, deep breaths, smelling alcohol, peppermint, or nothing. The smell of peppermint cut nausea in half within five minutes, and so did the alcohol. But, so did smelling nothing! So, maybe it had nothing to do with the scent; maybe it was just the instruction to take slow, deep breaths. That would make it a really cost-effective intervention. Maybe it shouldn’t be so surprising, given the proximity of the vomiting and breathing centers within the brain. And indeed, controlled breathing was found effective with or without any scent. So, next time you feel nauseous, inhale deeply through your nose to the count of three, hold your breath to the count of three, and exhale out the mouth to the count of three. Do that three times. Ironically, the researchers continued to advocate using those nasty smelling alcohol pads even though they themselves showed they weren’t any more effective than breathing alone. Why? Since isopropyl alcohol has a readily detectable odor, patients are more likely to think that their post-operation nausea and vomiting is being actively treated when they inhale alcohol vapors rather than just engaging in breathing exercises. What do you think of still using the alcohol pads even though they were shown to offer no additional benefit? I have a whole video on such questions: The Lie That Heals: Should Doctors Give Placebos? For those who can swallow, I offer more about powdered ginger in my video Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees. There’s more on aromatherapy here: What about actually eating the peppermint?  Of course, the best way to avoid postsurgical nausea is to try to avoid surgery in the first place. Those that eat healthy may be less likely to go under the knife.

A-7	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/28/white-meat-may-be-as-cholesterol-raising-as-red/	White Meat May Be as Cholesterol-Raising as Red	In light of recommendations for heart healthy eating from national professional organizations encouraging Americans to limit their intake of meat, the beef industry commissioned and co-wrote a review of randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of beef versus chicken and fish on cholesterol levels published over the last 60 years. They found that the impact of beef consumption on the cholesterol profile of humans is similar to that of fish and/or poultry—meaning that switching from red meat to white meat likely wouldn’t make any difference. And that’s really no surprise, given how fat we’ve genetically manipulated chickens to be these days, up to ten times more fat than they had a century ago (see Does Eating Obesity Cause Obesity?). There are a number of cuts of beef that have less cholesterol-raising saturated fat than chicken (see BOLD Indeed: Beef Lowers Cholesterol?); so, it’s not so surprising that white meat was found to be no better than red, but the beef industry researchers’ conclusion was that “therefore you can eat beef as part of a balanced diet to manage your cholesterol.” Think of the Coke versus Pepsi analogy. Coke has less sugar than Pepsi: 15 spoonfuls of sugar per bottle instead of 16. If studies on blood sugar found no difference between drinking Coke versus Pepsi, you wouldn’t conclude that “Pepsi may be considered when recommending diets for the management of blood sugars;” you’d say they’re both equally as bad so we should ideally consume neither. That’s a standard drug industry trick. You don’t compare your fancy new drug to the best out there, but to some miserable drug to make yours look better. Note they didn’t compare beef to plant proteins, like in this study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. As I started reading it, though, I was surprised that they found no benefit of switching to a plant protein diet either. What were they eating? You can see the comparison in Switching from Beef to Chicken & Fish May Not Lower Cholesterol.   For breakfast, the plant group got a kidney bean and tomato casserole and a salad, instead of a burger. And for dinner, instead of another burger, the plant protein group just got some boring vegetables. So, why was the cholesterol of the plant group as bad as the animal group? They had the plant protein group eating three tablespoons of beef tallow every day—three tablespoons of straight beef fat! This was part of a series of studies that tried to figure out what was so cholesterol-raising about meat—was it the animal protein or was it the animal fat? So, researchers created fake meat products made to have the same amount of saturated fat and cholesterol by adding extracted animal fats and cholesterol. Who could they get to make such strange concoctions? The Ralston Purina dog food company. But what’s crazy is that even when keeping the saturated animal fat and cholesterol the same (by adding meat fats to the veggie burgers and making the plant group swallow cholesterol pills to equal it out), sometimes they still saw a cholesterol lowering advantage in the plant protein group. If you switch people from meat to tofu, their cholesterol goes down, but what if you switch them from meat to tofu plus lard? Then, their cholesterol may stay the same, though tofu and lard may indeed actually be better than meat, since it may result in less oxidized cholesterol. More on the role of oxidized cholesterol can be found in my videos Does Cholesterol Size Matter? and Arterial Acne. Just swapping plant protein for animal protein may have advantages, but if you really want to maximize the power of diet to lower cholesterol, you may have to move entirely toward plants. The standard dietary advice to cut down on fatty meat, dairy, and eggs may lower cholesterol 5-10%, but flexitarian or vegetarian diets may drop our levels 10 to 15%, vegan diets 15 to 25%, and healthier vegan diets can cut up to 35%, as seen in this study out of Canada showing a whopping 61 point drop in LDL cholesterol within a matter of weeks. You thought chicken was a low-fat food? It used to be a century ago, but not anymore. It may even be one of the reasons we’re getting fatter as well: Chicken Big: Poultry and Obesity and Infectobesity: Adenovirus 36 and Childhood Obesity. Isn’t protein just protein? How does our body know if it’s coming from a plant or an animal? How could it have different effects on cardiovascular risk? See Protein and Heart Disease, another reason why Plant Protein [is] Preferable. Lowering cholesterol in your blood is as simple as reducing one’s intake of three things: Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. What about those news stories on the “vindication” of saturated fat? See the sneaky science in The Saturated Fat Studies: Buttering Up the Public and The Saturated Fat Studies: Set Up to Fail. 	-	animal fat,animal products,animal protein,beef,beverages,blood sugar,burgers,cardiovascular health,chicken,cholesterol,Coca Cola,cola,dairy,eggs,fat,fish,flexitarians,hamburgers,heart health,industry influence,lard,LDL cholesterol,meat,Pepsi,plant protein,plant-based diets,poultry,protein,red meat,saturated fat,soda,sugar,tofu,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,veggie burgers,white meat	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infectobesity-adenovirus-36-and-childhood-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-and-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-set-up-to-fail/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/567007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6496393,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19766762,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-and-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-cholesterol-size-matter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/Chicken-Big-Poultry-and-Obesity,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7197116,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10694766,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infectobesity-adenovirus-36-and-childhood-obesity/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11194529,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19728900,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/switching-from-beef-to-chicken-fish-may-not-lower-cholesterol/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22836072,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912836,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14624410	
A-8	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/23/can-you-eat-too-much-fruit/	Can You Eat Too Much Fruit?	In my video If Fructose is Bad, What About Fruit?, I explored how adding berries to our meals can actually blunt the detrimental effects of high glycemic foods, but how many berries? The purpose of one study out of Finland was to determine the minimum level of blueberry consumption at which a consumer may realistically expect to receive antioxidant benefits after eating blueberries with a sugary breakfast cereal. If we eat a bowl of corn flakes with no berries, within two hours, so many free radicals are created that it puts us into oxidative debt. The antioxidant power of our bloodstream drops below where we started from before breakfast, as the antioxidants in our bodies get used up dealing with such a crappy breakfast. As you can see in How Much Fruit is Too Much? video, a quarter cup of blueberries didn’t seem to help much, but a half cup of blueberries did. What about fruit for diabetics? Most guidelines recommend eating a diet with a high intake of fiber-rich food, including fruit, because they’re so healthy—antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, improving artery function, and reducing cancer risk. However, some health professionals have concerns about the sugar content of fruit and therefore recommend restricting the fruit intake. So let’s put it to the test! In a study from Denmark, diabetics were randomized into two groups: one told to eat at least two pieces of fruit a day, and the other told at most, two fruits a day. The reduce fruit group indeed reduce their fruit consumption, but it had no effect on the control of their diabetes or weight, and so, the researchers concluded, the intake of fruit should not be restricted in patients with type 2 diabetes. An emerging literature has shown that low-dose fructose may actually benefit blood sugar control. Having a piece of fruit with each meal would be expected to lower, not raise the blood sugar response. The threshold for toxicity of fructose may be around 50 grams. The problem is that’s the current average adult fructose consumption. So, the levels of half of all adults are likely above the threshold for fructose toxicity, and adolescents currently average 75. Is that limit for added sugars or for all fructose? If we don’t want more than 50 and there’s about ten in a piece of fruit, should we not eat more than five fruit a day? Quoting from the Harvard Health Letter, “the nutritional problems of fructose and sugar come when they are added to foods. Fruit, on the other hand, is beneficial in almost any amount.” What do they mean almost? Can we eat ten fruit a day? How about twenty fruit a day? It’s actually been put to the test. Seventeen people were made to eat 20 servings a day of fruit. Despite the extraordinarily high fructose content of this diet, presumably about 200 g/d—eight cans of soda worth, the investigators reported no adverse effects (and possible benefit actually) for body weight, blood pressure, and insulin and lipid levels after three to six months. More recently, Jenkins and colleagues put people on about a 20 servings of fruit a day diet for a few weeks and found no adverse effects on weight or blood pressure or triglycerides, and an astounding 38 point drop in LDL cholesterol. There was one side effect, though. Given the 44 servings of vegetables they had on top of all that fruit, they recorded the largest bowel movements apparently ever documented in a dietary intervention. Cutting down on sugary foods may be easier said than done (see Are Sugary Foods Addictive?) but it’s worth it. For more on the dangers of high levels of fructose in added sugars, see How Much Added Sugar Is Too Much?. What’s that about being in oxidative debt? See my three part series on how to pull yourself out of the red: Ironically, fat may be more of a problem when it comes to diabetes than sugar, see: 	-	antioxidants,berries,blood pressure,blueberries,breakfast cereal,cancer,diabetes,fiber,fructose,fruit,Harvard,high fructose corn syrup,insulin,LDL cholesterol,oxidative stress,prediabetes,safety limits,soda,stool size,sugar,vegetables	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-sugary-foods-addictive/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5573330,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11288049,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23497350,http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/24409538,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-sugary-foods-addictive/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22354959,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23493539,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23365108	
A-9	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/21/foods-linked-to-als/	Foods Linked to ALS	As explored in my video ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease): Fishing for Answers, there may be a link between the consumption of the neurotoxin BMAA, produced by algae blooms, and increased risk of ALS. It now appears that BMAA could be found in high concentrations in aquatic animals in many areas of the world. This could explain ALS clustering around lakes in New Hampshire—up to 25 times the expected rate of ALS with some families eating fish several times a week. Or in Wisconsin, where the most significant ALS risk factor was the past consumption of fish out of Lake Michigan. Or clustering in Finland’s Lakeland district, or seafood eaters in France, or around the Baltic sea, building up particularly in fishes, mussels and oysters. When I think of algae blooms I think of the Chesapeake bay near where I live, that gets choked off thanks in part to the poultry industry pollution. And indeed, there was a recent report linking BMAA exposure to ALS in Maryland. The ALS victims, all of whom ate Chesapeake Bay blue crabs every week, lived within a half mile of each other, which raised some eyebrows at the Johns Hopkins ALS center. And so, researchers tested a few crabs, and two out of three tested positive for BMAA, indicating that the neurotoxin is present in the aquatic food chain of the Chesapeake Bay and is a potential route for human exposure. To bring the story full circle, things in Guam, where the link between BMAA consumption and ALS was first discovered, are looking up. The ALS epidemic there may have been triggered by their acquisition of guns. Now though, the epidemic appears to be over thanks to near-extinction due to over-hunting of the fruit bats they were eating. But while the rates decline in Guam, neurodegenerative diseases like ALS around the rest of the world are on the rise. It’s plausible that humans have been exposed to some level of BMAA throughout their evolutionary history, but the increase in algae blooms as a result of human activities is probably increasing this exposure. There is a general consensus that harmful algal blooms are increasing worldwide thanks in part to industrialized agriculture (as shown in my video Diet & Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-ALS). More people means more sewage, fertilizer, and manure, which can mean more algae, which may mean more exposure to this neurotoxin, leading to a possible increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS. BMAA is considered a strong contender as the cause of, or at least a major contributor to, both endemic and sporadic ALS and Alzheimer’s disease, and possibly conferring risk for Parkinson’s diseases as well. The ramifications of this discovery are enormous. As researchers from Australia stated, “With substantial and ever growing evidence that BMAA does play a role in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, the most important question is, what mode of activity does BMAA exert?” Huh? That’s not the most important question we should be asking. The most important question is “How can we reduce our risk?” We know that the presence of BMAA in aquatic food chains could be a significant human health hazard. There may even be a synergistic toxicity between mercury and BMAA, making human consumption of certain species of fishes even riskier. Until more is known about the possible link of BMAA to Alzheimer’s and ALS, it may be prudent to limit exposure of BMAA in the human diet.

A-10	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/16/what-is-the-cause-of-als/	What Is the Cause of ALS?	Lou Gehrig’s disease, known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, strikes healthy, middle-aged people seemingly at random. Of the major neurodegenerative diseases, it has the least hope for treatment and survival. Although mental capabilities stay intact, ALS paralyzes people, often from the outside in, and most patients die within three years when they can no longer breathe or swallow. At any given time, an estimated 30,000 are fighting for their life with it in this country. We each have about a 1 in 400 chance of developing this dreaded disease. ALS is more common than generally recognized, with an incidence rate now close to that of multiple sclerosis. What causes it? 50 years ago scientists found that the rate of ALS among the indigenous peoples on the island of Guam was 100 times that found in the rest of the world, potentially offering a clue into the cause of the disease. So, instead of 1 in 400, in some villages in Guam, 1 in 3 adults died of the disease! Cycad trees were suspected, since the powdered seeds were a dietary staple of the natives, and there were reports of livestock showing neurological disease after eating from it. And indeed, a new neurotoxin was found in the seeds, called BMAA. Maybe that’s what was causing such high levels of ALS? But the amount of BMAA in the seeds people ate was so small that it was calculated that people would have to eat a thousand kilograms a day to get a toxic dose—that’s around a ton of seeds daily. So, the whole cycad theory was thrown out and the trail went cold. But then, famed neurologist Oliver Sachs and colleagues had an idea. Cycad seeds were not all the natives ate. They also ate fruit bats (also known as flying foxes) who ate cycad tree seeds. So, maybe this is a case of biomagnification up the food chain, as about a “ton’s” worth of BMAA does accumulate in the flesh of flying foxes. The final nail in the coffin was the detection of high levels of BMAA in the brains of six out of six native victims of the disease on autopsy, but not in control brains of healthy people that died. So, with the final puzzle piece apparently in place, the solution was found to this mysterious cluster on some exotic tropical isle of ALS/PDC, so-called because the form of ALS attacking people in Guam also had signs of Parkinson’s disease and dementia; so, they called it ALS parkinsonism dementia complex. So, when the researchers were choosing a comparison group of control brains, they also included two cases of Alzheimer’s disease. But these brains had BMAA in their brains too. And not only that, but these were Alzheimer’s victims in Canada, on the opposite side of the globe. So, the researchers ran more autopsies and found no BMAA in the control brains, but BMAA detected in all the Canadian Alzheimer’s victims tested. Canadians don’t eat fruit bats. What was going on? Well, the neurotoxin isn’t made by the bats, it’s made by the trees, although Canadians don’t eat cycad trees either. It turns out that cycad trees don’t make the neurotoxin either; it’s actually a blue-green algae that grows in the roots of the cycad trees which makes the BMAA that gets in the seeds, which gets in the bats, that finally gets into the people. And it’s not just this specific type of blue-green algae, but nearly all types of blue-green algae found all over the world produce BMAA. Up until only about a decade ago, we thought this neurotoxin was confined to this one weird tropical tree, but now we know the neurotoxin is created by algae throughout the world: from Europe to the U.S., Australia, the Middle East, and elsewhere. If these neurotoxin-producing blue-green algae are ubiquitous throughout the world, maybe BMAA is a cause of progressive neurodegenerative diseases including ALS worldwide. Researchers in Miami put it to the test and found BMAA in the brains of Floridians who died from sporadic Alzheimer’s disease and ALS, but not in the brains of those that died of a different neurodegenerative disease called Huntington’s, which we know is caused by a genetic mutation, not some neurotoxin. They found significant levels of BMAA in 49 out of 50 samples from 12 Alzheimer’s patients and 13 ALS patients. The results (shown in the my video ALS: Fishing for Answers) for American Alzheimer’s and ALS patients from the Atlantic southeast and from Canadian Alzheimer’s patients from the Pacific Northwest suggested that exposure to BMAA was widespread. The same thing was then found in the brains of those dying from Parkinson’s disease. You can apparently even pick up more BMAA in the hair of live ALS patients compared to controls. So, is BMAA present in Florida seafood? Yes, in freshwater fishes and shellfish, like oysters and bass, and out in the ocean as well. Some of the fishes, shrimps, and crabs had levels of BMAA comparable to those found in the fruit bats of Guam. In the U.S., fish may be the fruit bats. Maybe the ice bucket challenge should be to not serve seafood in them. See my video Diet and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) for more.

A-11	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/14/benefits-of-nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/	Benefits of Nutritional Yeast to Prevent the Common Cold	Natural immunomodulators that can help regulate our immune system without side-effects have been sought for centuries, and all the while they’ve been sitting in the produce aisle. Plants produce thousand of active compounds, many of which modulate our immune system, but we can’t forget the fungi (see Boosting Immunity While Reducing Inflammation). Mushrooms have been used for centuries as folk remedies, and for good reason. Some have been shown to boost immune function, so much so that a type of fiber found in shiitake mushrooms is approved for use as adjunct chemotherapy, injected intravenously to help treat a variety of cancers by rallying our immune defenses. More than 6,000 papers have been published on these so-called beta glucans, but almost all of the data about preventing infections had come from petri dish or lab animal studies, until a few years ago when a series of experiments on athletes showed beneficial effects in marathon runners (see Preserving Immune Function in Athletes With Nutritional Yeast). What about the rest of us? We didn’t know… until now. As I explore in my video, Nutritional Yeast to Prevent the Common Cold, beta glucan fiber found in baker’s, brewer’s, and nutritional yeast helps to maintain our body’s defense against pathogens even in nonathletes, according to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The recurrence of infections with the common cold was reduced by 25% in those that ate the equivalent of about a spoonful of nutritional yeast a day, and they had fewer cold-related sleeping difficulties when they did get sick. What about half a spoonful a day? Still worked! Subjects experienced a big drop in common cold incidence and a reduction in symptoms as well. Why is this? This study found that not only were upper respiratory infection symptoms diminished, but that mood states appeared to improve, for example, a significant boost in feelings of “vigor.” So, the researchers suggest that maybe the yeast fiber is able to counteract the negative effects of stress on the immune system. In terms of side effects, two folks reported stomachaches, but they were both in the placebo group. Unlike antibiotics and antivirals, which are designed to kill the pathogens directly, these yeast compounds instead appear to work by stimulating our immune defenses, and as such don’t share the same antibiotic side effects. They stimulate our immune defenses presumably because our body recognizes them as foreign. But if it’s treated like an invader, might it trigger an inflammatory response? Turns out these fiber compounds may actually have an anti-inflammatory effect, suggesting nutritional yeast may offer the best of both worlds, boosting the infection fighting side of the immune system while suppressing inflammatory components. Yeast is high in purines; so, those with gout, uric acid kidney stones, and new organ transplant recipients may want to keep their intake to less than a teaspoon a day. But is there any downside for everyone else? In California, some packages of nutritional yeast are slapped with prop 65 warning stickers, suggesting there’s something in it exceeding cancer or birth defect safety limits. I called around to the companies, and it turns out the problem is lead.  California state law says a product cannot contain more than half of a microgram of lead per daily serving; so, I contacted the six brands I knew about and asked them how much lead was in their products. KAL originally said “<5 ppm,” but when we called back they said “<3 ppm.” Even if it’s 3, that translates into less than 45 micrograms per serving, nearly a 100 times more than the California limit. But perhaps that’s better than Bob’s Red Mill or Frontier Coop, who evidently don’t test at all. But at least they got back to me. Redstar brand failed to respond to multiple attempts to contact them. Now Foods said they test for lead and claim that at least their recent batches meet the less than a half a microgram California standard. Unfortunately, despite repeated requests, they would not provide me with documentation to substantiate their numbers. My favorite response was from Bragg’s who sent me the analysis certificate from the lab showing less than 0.01 ppm, which means at most less than half the California standard, which I believe is the most stringent in the world. To put the numbers in context, in determining how much lead manufacturers can put into candy likely to be frequently consumed by small children, the Food and Drug Administration would allow about 2 micrograms a day in the form of lollipops, but as far as I’m concerned, the less lead the better. I was so frustrated by the lack of transparency, I decided to test them for lead myself. NutritionFacts.org hired an independent lab to conduct our own tests for lead and shipped out 8 samples of nutritional yeast in their original package. The lab used standard practices for lead testing known as Official Methods of Analysis set by AOAC International. Lab technicians determined the lead values based on California Prop 65 standards. Here are the results from the brands we tested: Bob’s Red Mill  – Test report shows no detectable lead (<0.01 ppm). Bragg – Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Dr. Fuhrman –  Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Frontier Coop – Test report shows lead levels at 0.021 ppm. It would take six tablespoons a day (based on the manufacture’s listed density) to exceed the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment Maximum Allowable Dose Level (MADL) for chemicals causing reproductive toxicity.* KAL – Test report shows lead levels at 0.011 ppm. It would take seven tablespoons a day to exceed the MADL.* NOW Foods – Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Red Star – Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Whole Foods – Test report shows lead levels at 0.012 ppm. It would take six tablespoons a day to exceed the MADL.* So, what do all those numbers mean? None of the brands tested exceeded California prop 65 standards. No matter what brand, consuming a typical serving (2 tablespoons) per day is still well within safe limits.

Oats are reported to possess varied drug-like activities like lowering blood cholesterol and blood sugar, boosting our immune system, anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-atherosclerosis activities, in addition to being a topical anti-inflammatory, and reportedly may also be useful in controlling childhood asthma and body weight.  Whole-grain intake in general is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and weight gain, as shown in my video Can Oatmeal Help Fatty Liver Disease?. All of the cohort studies on type 2 diabetes and heart disease show whole grain intake is associated with lower risk. Researchers have observed the same for obesity—consistently less weight gain for those who consumed a few servings of whole grains every day. All the forward-looking population studies demonstrate that a higher intake of whole grains is associated with lower body mass index and body weight gain. However, these results do not clarify whether whole grain consumption is simply a marker of a healthier lifestyle or a factor favoring lower body weight. For example, high whole grain consumers—those who eat whole wheat, brown rice, and oatmeal for breakfast—tend to be more physically active, smoke less, and consume more fruit, vegetables, and dietary fiber than those that instead reach for Froot Loops. Statistically, one can control these factors, effectively comparing nonsmokers to nonsmokers with similar exercise and diet as most of the studies did, and they still found whole grains to be protective via a variety of mechanisms. For example, in terms of helping with weight control, the soluble fiber of oatmeal forms a gel in the stomach, delaying stomach emptying, making one feel full for a longer period. It seems plausible that whole grain intake does indeed offer direct benefits, but only results of randomized controlled intervention studies can provide direct evidence of cause and effect. In other words, the evidence is clear that oatmeal consumers have lower rates of disease, but that’s not the same as proving that if we start eating more oatmeal, our risk will drop. To know that, we need an interventional trial, ideally a blinded study where you give half the people oatmeal, and the other half fake placebo oatmeal that looks and tastes like oatmeal, to see if it actually works. And that’s what we finally got—a double-blinded randomized trial of overweight and obese men and women. Almost 90% of the real oatmeal-treated subjects had reduced body weight, compared to no weight loss in the control group. They saw a slimmer waist on average, a 20 point drop in cholesterol, and an improvement in liver function.  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, meaning a fatty liver caused by excess food rather than excess drink, is now the most common cause of liver disease in the United States, and can lead in rare cases to cirrhosis of the liver, cancer of the liver, and death. Theoretically, whole grains could help prevent and treat fatty liver disease, but that was the first time it had been put to the test. A follow-up study in 2014 confirmed these findings of a protective role of whole grains, but refined grains were associated with increased risk. So, one would not expect to get such wonderful results from Wonder Bread. How can you make your oatmeal even healthier? See Antioxidants in a Pinch. Whole Grains May Work As Well As Drugs for hypertension, but refined grain intake may linked with high blood pressure and diseases like diabetes.

A-13	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/07/does-oatmeal-lotion-work/	Does Oatmeal Lotion Work?	A review in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology notes oatmeal has been used for centuries as a topical soothing agent on the skin to relieve itch and irritation in dermatology. Of course, that was coming from Johnson & Johnson, which sells a brand of oatmeal lotion. But if it helps with dry skin or a bug bite, I can imagine it having some soothing quality. One study out of Georgetown University, though, shocked me. There’s a class of chemo drugs, like Cetuximab, that can cause an awful rash. Various treatments have been tried and failed. There was no clear preventive or curative treatment for this eruption, until this remarkable study, which you can see in my Oatmeal Lotion for Chemotherapy-Induced Rash video. The researchers had heard about a study where human skin fragments from plastic surgery were subjected to an inflammatory chemical, and adding an oatmeal extract appeared to help. Of the ten patients with chemo rashes who the researchers were able to get to try some oatmeal lotion, six had a complete response, and four a partial response, giving an overall oatmeal response rate of 100%. Doctors wrote in from around the world. Significant improvement in all patients seemed too good to be true, but out of desperation they tried it and got the same astonishing results. Oatmeal—a simple topical agent producing such spectacular benefit where more complex therapies have failed. In an age when ever more expensive treatments are consistently being championed, it would be a great pity if this inexpensive, natural approach to relieving distressing symptoms were to be overlooked. Ironically, two of the cancer cell lines found resistant in vitro to this type of chemotherapy were found to be sensitive to avenanthramides, which are unique phytonutrients found in oats, suggesting that people should be applying oatmeal to their insides as well. Normally, I wouldn’t make a whole video for such a rare use but, I was so impressed with the results, I figured that even if I could help one person in this situation it would be worth it. Reminds me of my videos Treating Gorlin Syndrome With Green Tea and Topical Application of Turmeric Curcumin for Cancer. If oatmeal is so powerful that it can clear up some of the ravages of chemotherapy just applied to the skin, what might it do if we actually ate it? That’s the subject of my video Can Oatmeal Help Fatty Liver Disease?. Cetuximab is often given for metastatic colorectal cancer.

A-14	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/02/02/what-not-to-add-to-white-rice-potatoes-or-pasta/	What Not to Add to White Rice, Potatoes, or Pasta	Rice currently feeds almost half the human population, making it the single most important staple food in the world, but a meta-analysis of seven cohort studies following 350,000 people for up to 20 years found that higher consumption of white rice was associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, especially in Asian populations. They estimated each serving per day of white rice was associated with an 11% increase in risk of diabetes. This could explain why China has almost the same diabetes rates as we do. Diabetes rates in China are at about 10%; we’re at about 11%, despite seven times less obesity in China. Japan has eight times less obesity than we do, yet may have a higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes cases than we do—nine per a thousand compared to our eight. They’re skinnier and still may have more diabetes. Maybe it’s because of all the white rice they eat. Eating whole fruit is associated with lower risk of diabetes, whereas eating fruit processed into juice may not just be neutral, but actually increases diabetes risk. In the same way, eating whole grains, like whole wheat bread or brown rice is associated with lower risk of diabetes, whereas eating white rice, a processed grain, may not just be neutral, but actually increase diabetes risk. White rice consumption does not appear to be associated with increased risk of heart attack or stroke, though, which is a relief after an earlier study in China suggested a connection with stroke. But, do we want to eat a food that’s just neutral regarding some of our leading causes of death, when we can eat whole foods that are associated with lower risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and weight gain? If the modern diabetes epidemic in China and Japan has been linked to white rice consumption, how can we reconcile that with low diabetes rates just a few decades ago when they ate even more rice? If you look at the Cornell-Oxford-China Project, rural plant-based diets centered around rice were associated with relatively low risk of the so-called diseases of affluence, which include diabetes. Maybe Asians just genetically don’t get the same blood sugar spike when they eat white rice? This is not the case; if anything, people of Chinese ethnicity get higher blood sugar spikes. The rise in these diseases of affluence in China over the last half century has been blamed in part on the tripling of the consumption of animal source foods. The upsurge in diabetes has been most dramatic, and it’s mostly just happened over the last decade. That crazy 9.7% diabetes prevalence figure that rivals ours is new—they appeared to have one of the lowest diabetes rates in the world in the year 2000. So, what happened to their diets in the last 20 years or so? Oil consumption went up 20%, pork consumption went up 40%, and rice consumption dropped about 30%. As diabetes rates were skyrocketing, rice consumption was going down; so, maybe it’s the animal products and junk food that are the problem. Yes, brown rice is better than white rice, but to stop the mounting Asian epidemic, maybe we should focus on removing the cause—the toxic Western diet. That would be consistent with data showing animal protein and fat consumption associated with increased diabetes risk. But, that doesn’t explain why the biggest recent studies in Japan and China associate white rice intake with diabetes. One possibility is that animal protein is making the rice worse. If you feed people mashed white potatoes, a high glycemic food like white rice, you can see in my video If White Rice is Linked to Diabetes, What About China? the level of insulin your pancreas has to pump out to keep your blood sugars in check. But what if you added some tuna fish? Tuna doesn’t have any carbs, sugar, or starch; so, it shouldn’t make a difference. Or maybe it would even lower the mashed potato spike by lowering the glycemic load of the whole meal? Instead, you get twice the insulin spike. This also happens with white flour spaghetti versus white flour spaghetti with meat. The addition of animal protein makes the pancreas work twice as hard. You can do it with straight sugar water too. If you do a glucose challenge test to test for diabetes, where you drink a certain amount of sugar and add some meat, you get a much bigger spike than without meat. And, the more meat you add, the worse it gets. Just adding a little meat to carbs doesn’t seem to do much, but once you get up to around a third of a chicken breast’s worth, you can elicit a significantly increased surge of insulin. This may help explain why those eating plant-based have such low diabetes rates, because animal protein can markedly potentiate the insulin secretion triggered by carbohydrate ingestion. The protein exacerbation of the effect of refined carbs could help explain the remarkable results achieved by Dr. Kempner with a don’t-try-this-at-home diet composed of mostly white rice and sugar. See my video, Kempner Rice Diet: Whipping Us Into Shape. Refined grains may also not be good for our blood pressure (see Whole Grains May Work As Well As Drugs).

A-15	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/31/why-is-milk-consumption-associated-with-more-bone-fractures/	Why Is Milk Consumption Associated with More Bone Fractures?	Milk is touted to build strong bones, but a compilation of all the best studies found no association between milk consumption and hip fracture risk; so, drinking milk as an adult might not help bones, but what about in adolescence? Harvard researchers decided to put it to the test. Studies have shown that greater milk consumption during childhood and adolescence contributes to peak bone mass, and is therefore expected to help avoid osteoporosis and bone fractures in later life. But that’s not what researchers have found (as you can see in my video Is Milk Good for Our Bones?). Milk consumption during teenage years was not associated with a lower risk of hip fracture, and if anything, milk consumption was associated with a borderline increase in fracture risk in men. It appears that the extra boost in total body bone mineral density from getting extra calcium is lost within a few years, even if you keep the calcium supplementation up. This suggests a partial explanation for the long-standing enigma that hip fracture rates are highest in populations with the greatest milk consumption. This may be an explanation for why they’re not lower, but why would they be higher? This enigma irked a Swedish research team, puzzled because studies again and again had shown a tendency of a higher risk of fracture with a higher intake of milk. Well, there is a rare birth defect called galactosemia, where babies are born without the enzymes needed to detoxify the galactose found in milk; so, they end up with elevated levels of galactose in their blood, which can cause bone loss even as kids. So maybe, the Swedish researchers figured, even in normal people that can detoxify the stuff, it might not be good for the bones to be drinking it every day. And galactose doesn’t just hurt the bones. Galactose is what scientists use to cause premature aging in lab animals—it can shorten their lifespan, cause oxidative stress, inflammation, and brain degeneration—just with the equivalent of like one to two glasses of milk’s worth of galactose a day. We’re not rats, though. But given the high amount of galactose in milk, recommendations to increase milk intake for prevention of fractures could be a conceivable contradiction. So, the researchers decided to put it to the test, looking at milk intake and mortality as well as fracture risk to test their theory.  A hundred thousand men and women were followed for up to 20 years. Researchers found that milk-drinking women had higher rates of death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer for each glass of milk. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of premature death, and they had significantly more bone and hip fractures. More milk, more fractures. Men in a separate study also had a higher rate of death with higher milk consumption, but at least they didn’t have higher fracture rates. So, the researchers found a dose dependent higher rate of both mortality and fracture in women, and a higher rate of mortality in men with milk intake, but the opposite for other dairy products like soured milk and yogurt, which would go along with the galactose theory, since bacteria can ferment away some of the lactose. To prove it though, we need a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of milk intake on mortality and fractures. As the accompanying editorial pointed out, we better find this out soon, since milk consumption is on the rise around the world. What can we do for our bones, then? Weight-bearing exercise such as jumping, weight-lifting, and walking with a weighted vest or backpack may help, along with getting enough calcium (Alkaline Diets, Animal Protein, & Calcium Loss) and vitamin D (Resolving the Vitamin D-Bate). Eating beans (Phytates for the Prevention of Osteoporosis) and avoiding phosphate additives (Phosphate Additives in Meat Purge and Cola) may also help. Maybe the galactose angle can help explain the findings on prostate cancer (Prostate Cancer and Organic Milk vs. Almond Milk) and Parkinson’s disease (Preventing Parkinson’s Disease With Diet). Galactose is a milk sugar. There’s also concern about milk proteins (see my casomorphin series) and fats (The Saturated Fat Studies: Buttering Up the Public and Trans Fat in Meat and Dairy) as well as the hormones (Dairy Estrogen and Male Fertility, Estrogen in Meat, Dairy, and Eggs and Why Do Vegan Women Have 5x Fewer Twins?).   Milk might also play a role in diabetes (Does Casein in Milk Trigger Type 1 Diabetes, Does Bovine Insulin in Milk Trigger Type 1 Diabetes?) and breast cancer (Is Bovine Leukemia in Milk Infectious?, The Role of Bovine Leukemia Virus in Breast Cancer, and Industry Response to Bovine Leukemia Virus in Breast Cancer).  In health, 	-	adolescence,aging,animal studies,bone fractures,bone health,bone mineral density,brain disease,brain health,cancer,cardiovascular disease,children,dairy,fermented foods,galactose,galactosemia,Harvard,heart disease,inflammation,lactose,longevity,men's health,milk,mortality,osteoporosis,oxidative stress,women's health,yogurt	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/casomorphin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/Estrogen-in-Meat-Dairy-and-Eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industry-response-to-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-good-for-our-bones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-milk-infectious/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resolving-the-vitamin-d-bate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-casein-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20949604,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-breast-cancer/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25352269,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-estrogen-and-male-infertility,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/casomorphin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/Estrogen-in-Meat-Dairy-and-Eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6205,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/10/31/study-milk-may-not-be-very-good-for-bones-or-the-body/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytates-for-the-prevention-of-osteoporosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-cancer-and-organic-milk-vs-almond-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-milk-good-for-our-bones/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640478,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-milk-infectious/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24247817,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resolving-the-vitamin-d-bate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22525982,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-casein-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-bovine-insulin-in-milk-trigger-type-1-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/Why-Do-Vegan-Women-Have-5x-Fewer-Twins?	
A-16	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/26/are-sugar-pills-better-than-antidepressant-drugs/	Are Sugar Pills Better than Antidepressant Drugs?	We’ve learned that exercise compares favorably to antidepressant medications as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression (in my video Exercise vs. Drugs for Depression). But how much is that really saying? How effective are antidepressant drugs in the first place? A recent meta-analysis sparked huge scientific and public controversy by stating that the placebo effect can explain the apparent clinical benefits of antidepressants. But aren’t there thousands of clinical trials providing compelling evidence for antidepressant effectiveness? If a meta-analysis compiles together all the best published research, how could it say they don’t work much better than sugar pills? The key word is “published.” What if a drug company decided only to publish studies that showed a positive effect, but quietly shelved and concealed any studies showing the drug didn’t work? If you didn’t know any better, you’d look at the published medical literature and think “Wow, this drug is great.” And what if all the drug companies did that? To find out if this was the case, researchers applied to the FDA under the Freedom of Information Act to get access to the published and unpublished studies submitted by pharmaceutical companies, and what they found was shocking. According to the published literature, the results of nearly all the trials of antidepressants were positive, meaning they worked. In contrast, FDA analysis of the trial data showed only roughly half of the trials had positive results. In other words, about half the studies showed the drugs didn’t work. Thus, when published and unpublished data are combined, they fail to show a clinically significant advantage for antidepressant medication over a sugar pill. Not publishing negative results undermines evidence-based medicine and puts millions of patients at risk for using ineffective or unsafe drugs, and this was the case with these antidepressant drugs. These revelations hit first in 2008. Prozac, Serzone, Paxil, and Effexor worked, but so did sugar pills, and the difference between the drug and placebo was small. That was 2008. Where were we by 2014? Analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits of antidepressants are due to the placebo effect. And what’s even worse, Freedom of Information Act documents show the FDA knew about it but made an explicit decision to keep this information from the public and from prescribing physicians.  How could drug companies get away with this? The pharmaceutical industry is considered the most profitable and politically influential industry in the United States, and mental illness can be thought of as the drug industry’s golden goose: incurable, common, long term, and involving multiple medications. Antidepressant medications are prescribed to 8.7 percent of the U.S. population. It’s a multi-billion dollar market. To summarize, there is a strong therapeutic response to antidepressant medication; it’s just that the response to placebo is almost as strong. Indeed, antidepressants offer substantial benefits to millions of people suffering from depression, and to cast them as ineffective is inaccurate. Just because they may not work better than fake pills doesn’t mean they don’t work. It’s like homeopathy—just because it doesn’t work better than the sugar pills, doesn’t mean that homeopathy doesn’t work. The placebo effect is real and powerful. In one psychopharmacology journal, a psychiatrist funded by the Prozac company defends the drugs stating, “A key issue is disregarded by the naysaying critics. If the patient is benefiting from antidepressant treatment does it matter whether this is being achieved via drug or placebo effects?” Of course it matters! Among the side effects of antidepressants are: sexual dysfunction in up to three quarters of people, long-term weight gain, insomnia, nausea, and diarrhea. About one in five show withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit. And, perhaps more tragically, the drugs may make people more likely to become depressed in the future. Let me say that again: People are more likely to become depressed after treatment by antidepressants than after treatment by other means – including placebo. So, if doctors are willing to give patients placebo-equivalent treatments, maybe it’d be better for them to just lie to patients and give them actual sugar pills. Yes, that involves deception, but isn’t that preferable than deception with a side of side effects? See more on this in my video Do Antidepressant Drugs Really Work? If different treatments are equally effective, then choice should be based on risk and harm, and of all of the available treatments, antidepressant drugs may be among the riskiest and most harmful. If they are to be used at all, it should be as a last resort, when depression is extremely severe and all other treatment alternatives have been tried and failed. Antidepressants may not work better than placebo for mild and moderate depression, but for very severe depression, the drugs do beat out sugar pills. But that’s just a small fraction of the people taking these drugs. That means that the vast majority of depressed patients—as many as nine out of ten—are being prescribed medications that have negligible benefits to them. Too many doctors quickly decide upon a depression diagnosis without necessarily listening to what the patients have to say and end up putting them on antidepressants without considering alternatives. And fortunately, there are effective alternatives. Physical exercise, for example, can have lasting effects, and if that turns out to also be a placebo effect, it is at least a placebo with an enviable list of side effects. Whereas side effects of antidepressants include things like sexual dysfunction and insomnia, side effects of exercise include enhanced libido, better sleep, decreased body fat, improved muscle tone, and a longer life. There are other ways meta-analyses can be misleading. See The Saturated Fat Studies: Buttering Up the Public and The Saturated Fat Studies: Set Up to Fail.

A-17	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/24/exercise-as-a-treatment-for-depression/	Exercise as a Treatment for Depression	We’ve known for decades that even a single bout of exercise can elevate our mood, but could it be enough to be used as a treatment for major depression? We’ve known that physical activity has been associated with decreased symptoms of depression. For example, if you look at a cross-section of 8,000 people across the country, those that exercised regularly were less likely to have a major depression diagnosis. That’s just a snapshot in time, though. In that study, the researcher openly acknowledges this may be a case of reverse causation. Maybe exercise didn’t cut down on depression, maybe depression cut down on exercise. The reason depression may be associated with low physical activity is that people may feel too lousy to get out of bed. What we’ve needed was an interventional study where you take people who are already depressed and randomize them into an exercise intervention.  That is what researchers from Duke University Medical Center did. They randomized men and women over age 50 with major depression to two groups: one who did an aerobic exercise program for four months and another that took an antidepressant drug called Zoloft. In my video Exercise vs. Drugs for Depression, you can see a graph of their changes. Before exercise, their Hamilton Depression scores were up around 18 (anything over seven is considered depressed). Within four months, the drug group came down to normal, which is exactly what the drugs are supposed to do. What about the exercise-only group, though? Exercise had the same powerful effect. The researchers concluded that an exercise training program may be considered an alternative to antidepressants for treatment of depression in older persons, given that they’ve shown that a group program of aerobic exercise is a feasible and effective treatment for depression, at least for older people. Not so fast, though. A “group program?” They had the exercise group folks come in three times a week for a group class. Maybe the only reason the exercise group got better is because they were forced to get out of bed and interact with people—maybe it was the social stimulation and had nothing to do with the actual exercise? Before you could definitively say that exercise can work as well as drugs, what we would need to see is the same study, but with an additional group who exercised alone with no extra social interaction. And those same Duke researchers did just that. They created the largest exercise trial of patients with major depression conducted to date, and not just including older folks, but other adults as well with three different treatment groups this time: a home exercise group in addition to the supervised group exercise and the drug group as before. And, they all worked about just as well in terms of forcing the depression into remission. So, we can say with confidence that exercise is comparable to antidepressant medication in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. Putting all the best studies together, researchers indicate that exercise at least has a moderate antidepressant effect, and at best, exercise has a large effect on reductions in depression symptoms and could be categorized as a very useful and powerful intervention. Unfortunately, while studies support the use of exercise as a treatment for depression, exercise is rarely prescribed as a treatment for this common and debilitating problem. Exercise may compare favorably to antidepressant medications as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression, but how much is that really saying? How effective are antidepressant drugs in the first place? Check out my video Do Antidepressant Drugs Really Work? For dietary interventions that may improve mood, see: Exercise can also help with ADHD (Treating ADHD Without Stimulants) and improve immunity (Preserving Immune Function in Athletes With Nutritional Yeast), not to mention extend our lives (Longer Life Within Walking Distance).

A-18	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/19/four-ways-to-improve-on-the-mediterranean-diet/	Four Ways to Improve on the Mediterranean Diet	The traditional Mediterranean diet can be considered mainly, but not exclusively, as a plant-based diet, and certainly not a whole foods, plant-based diet. Olive oil and wine can be considered essentially fruit juices. Even if one is eating a “vegiterranean diet,” an entirely plant-based version, there are a number of problematic nutritional aspects that are rarely talked about. For example, the Mediterranean diet includes lots of white bread, white pasta and not a lot of whole grains. In an anatomy of the health effects of the Mediterranean diet, the single most important component was the high consumption of plant foods. In contrast, high cereal consumption, meaning high grain consumption, did not appear to help. This may be because most grains that modern Mediterranean dieters eat are refined, like white bread, whereas the traditional Mediterranean diet was characterized by unprocessed cereals—in other words, whole grains. And while whole grains have been associated with lower risk of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, refined grain may increase the risk of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and other chronic diseases. In the PREDIMED study, those who ate the most white bread—but not whole grain bread—gained significant weight. Alcohol may also be a problem. As a plant-centered diet, adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower cancer risk, but does not appear to lower breast cancer risk. With all the fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, beans, and low saturated fat content, you’d assume there would be lower breast cancer risk, but alcohol is a known breast carcinogen, even in moderate amounts. When researchers created a special adapted version of the Mediterranean diet score that excluded alcohol, the diet does indeed appear to reduce breast cancer risk.  The wonderful grape phytonutrients in red wine can improve our arterial function such that if you drink nonalcoholic red wine (wine with the alcohol removed), you get a significant boost in endothelial function—the ability of our arteries to relax and dilate normally, increasing blood flow. If you drink the same red wine with alcohol, it abolishes the beneficial effect and counteracts the benefit of the grape phytonutrients. So, it would be better just to eat grapes. You can find more information about this in my video Improving on the Mediterranean Diet. Similarly, there are components of extra virgin olive oil—the antioxidant phytonutrients, that may help endothelial function, but when consumed as oil, (even extra virgin olive oil), it may impair arterial function. So, even if white bread dipped in olive oil is the very symbol of the Mediterranean diet, we can modernize it by removing oils and refined grains. Another important, albeit frequently ignored, issue in the modern Mediterranean diet is sodium intake. Despite evidence linking salt intake to high blood pressure, heart disease, and strokes, dietary salt intake in the U.S. is on the rise. Right now, Americans get about seven to ten grams a day, mostly from processed foods. If we were to decrease that just by three grams every year, we could possibly save tens of thousands of people from having a heart attack, prevent tens of thousands of strokes, and tens of thousands of deaths. There is a common misperception that only certain people should reduce their salt intake and that for the vast majority of the population, salt reduction is unnecessary, but in reality, the opposite is true. There is much we can learn from the traditional Mediterranean diet. An abundance of plant foods is a defining characteristic of the Mediterranean diet, but recognition of the importance of this characteristic seems to have fallen by the wayside. No main Mediterranean meal is complete without lots of greens, a key part of not only a good Mediterranean diet, but of any good diet.

A-19	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/17/what-do-all-the-blue-zones-have-in-common/	What Do All the Blue Zones Have in Common?	What accounts for the benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet? An anatomy of health effects was published, and the single most important component was the high consumption of plant foods. In contrast, fish and seafood consumption, the only animal foods promoted in the Mediterranean diet, did not seem to help. If you look at four of the major dietary quality scoring systems, which have all been associated with extending lifespan and lowering heart disease and cancer mortality, they all share only four things in common: more fruit, more vegetables, more whole grains, and more nuts and beans. They are all built on a common core of a diet rich in plant foods, whereas opposite food patterns, rich in animal foods and poor in plant-based foods (in other words, the Western diet), is associated with higher risks. So, we need to optimize the food environment to support whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and plant-based proteins. That’s one of the things all the so-called Blue Zones have in common: the longest living populations have not only social support and engagement and daily exercise, but nutritionally, they all center their diets around plant foods, reserving meat mostly for special occasions. In fact, the population with perhaps the highest life-expectancy in the world, the California Adventist vegetarians, doesn’t eat any meat at all. So, if the primary benefits of the Mediterranean diet are due to all the whole plant foods, what if you went back to the famous PREDIMED study and created a “provegetarian” scoring system? We know vegetarians live longer, but because a pure vegetarian diet might not easily be embraced by many individuals, maybe it would be easier to swallow if we just tell people to “eat more plant-based foods and fewer animal-based foods.” But would just moving along the spectrum towards more plants actually enable people to live longer? Researchers thought of this food pattern as a “gentle approach” to vegetarianism, figuring that if it improved survival, it would be an easily understandable message for health promotion: more plant foods, fewer animal foods. On this scoring system, you get points for eating fruit, vegetables, nuts, grains, beans, olive oil, and potatoes, but get docked points for any animal fats, eggs, fish, dairy, or any type of meat or meat products. Of course, that means you get a higher score the more potato chips and French fries you eat. That’s why I prefer the term “whole-food, plant-based diet”, since it’s defined by what you eat, not by what you don’t eat. When I taught at Cornell, I had “vegan” students who apparently were trying to live off French fries and beer; vegan does not necessarily mean health-promoting. But did the provegetarian scoring system work? Regardless of healthy versus unhealthy, if you give points to people for any kind of plant food, processed or not, and detract points for any kind of animal product consumption, people with higher scores live longer. The maximum provegetarian score is 60, but even just scoring 40 or more was associated with a 40 percent drop in mortality. In fact, there were so few deaths in the highest category of adherence to the provegetarian diet, they had to merge the two upper categories for their analysis. This is evidence that simple advice to increase the consumption of plant-derived foods with reductions in the consumption of foods from animal sources confers a survival advantage. You can view the graph in my video Do Flexitarians Live Longer? The researchers conclude, “this modest change is realistic, affordable, and achievable because a sizable proportion of their population was already eating that way. So one can get significant survival benefit without a radical shift to the exclusive consumption of plant foods, a more gradual and gentle approach which is more easily translatable into public policy.” A 41 percent drop in mortality rates in the United States would mean saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. Here are some of my previous videos on the Mediterranean diet: I’ve done a few videos on the health of so-called semi-vegetarians or flexitarians (“flexible” vegetarians). See how they rate in: The Provegetarian Score reminds me of the animal to vegetable protein ratio in Prostate Cancer Survival: The A/V Ratio. My favorite dietary quality index is the one in Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score. How do you rate? Even the healthiest among us may be able to continue to push the envelope.

A-20	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/12/the-two-active-ingredients-of-the-mediterranean-diet/	The Two Most Active Ingredients of the Mediterranean Diet	Olives and nuts are plant foods, and as such, are packed with antioxidants, raising the antioxidant level of our bloodstream resulting in lower fat oxidation and free radical DNA damage, but what’s happening inside people’s arteries? Researchers measured the amount of atherosclerotic plaque in the neck arteries going to the brain in folks who for years were eating added nuts, added extra virgin olive oil, or neither to their daily diets. In the control group, the plaque got worse, which is what happens when one continues to eat an artery-clogging diet, but there were no significant changes in the added extra virgin olive oil group, and the plaque in the added nut group appeared to get better. The nuts appeared to induce a regression of the disease, or at least a significant delay in the progression. The nut group was still suffering strokes, but only half as many, perhaps because the reduction in plaque height within the arteries on extra nuts was indicating a stabilization of the plaque, rendering them less likely to rupture. You can see these results in my video Which Parts of the Mediterranean Diet Extended Life? Adding nuts to our diet may also improve endothelial function, boosting the ability of our arteries to dilate naturally by about 30 percent. If you look at the baseline adherence to Mediterranean diet principles and control for things like smoking and exercise, there were only two factors significantly associated with reduced heart attack and stroke risk: more vegetables and more nuts. No significant association with the olive oil, wine, fish or cutting back on soda and cookies. Among the individual components, only increased consumption of vegetables and nuts were related to reduced cardiovascular events. On the one hand, cutting stroke risk in half just by eating a handful of nuts a day is pretty amazing, but those in the added nut group didn’t appear to live any longer overall. This is in contrast to other studies that suggested that frequent nut consumption may extend life. For example, the Harvard Health Professionals studies, involving a whopping three million person-years of follow-up over decades, found nut consumption associated with fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease, respiratory disease, and most importantly, fewer deaths overall. In a recent review, this was confirmed by all the other big major prospective studies. So, what’s going on here with the study showing no longevity benefit from nuts? Did they just not wait long enough? Just because people were randomized to the nut group didn’t mean they actually ate more nuts, and those randomized to the other groups didn’t necessarily stay away. If you re-analyze the data comparing the death rates of those who actually ate more nuts to those who actually didn’t, nut consumption was indeed associated with significantly reduced risk of death. If you do the same kind of post hoc analysis with olive oil, even with the extra virgin, there is no benefit in terms of living longer. This is consistent with how Ancel Keys, the so-called Father of the Mediterranean diet, viewed olive oil. He thought of its benefit more as a way of just replacing animal fats: anything to get people to eat less lard and butter. What is the best kind of nut? The greatest benefits were attributed to walnuts, particularly for preventing cancer deaths. Those eating more than three servings of walnuts a week appeared to cut their risk of dying from cancer in half. Now, it’s just a matter of communicating the research to the public. All the major cancer groups emphasize a more plant-based diet, remarkably consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines for healthy eating. The far-reaching positive effects of a plant-based diet—including walnuts—may be the most critical message for the public. Here are some of my previous videos on the Mediterranean diet: Think the effects of adding a few nuts to one’s daily diet are too good to believe? Check out my video Four Nuts Once a Month.

A-21	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/10/benefits-of-nuts-for-stroke-prevention/	Benefits of Nuts for Stroke Prevention	In the PREDIMED study, from the Spanish “PREvencio ́n con DIeta MEDiterranea,” a whopping 7,447 patients were randomized into three groups. These were folks at high risk for a heart attack.  About half were obese and diabetic and most had high blood pressure and high cholesterol, but they had not yet had their first heart attack or stroke. A third were told to eat a Mediterranean diet and given a free quart of extra virgin olive oil every week. The second group were told to eat a Mediterranean diet and given a free half pound of nuts every week, and the last third were told to follow the American Heart Association guidelines and reduce their fat intake. No portion control or exercise advice was given, and they were followed for about five years. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The first thing you do when you look at a diet intervention trial is see what the groups actually ended up eating, which can be very different from what they were told to eat. For example, the so-called low-fat group started out at 39 percent of calories from fat, and ended up getting 37 percent of calories from fat, which is high fat even compared to the Standard American Diet which comes in at 33 percent, something the researchers plainly acknowledged. In fact, the control group didn’t change much at all over the years, so can be thought of as the what-if-you-don’t-do-anything group, which is still an important control group to have. However, the two Mediterranean diet groups didn’t get much more Mediterranean. You can see the charts in my video PREDIMED: Does Eating Nuts Prevent Strokes? The two Mediterranean groups were told to eat more fruits and vegetables, for example, and less meat and dairy, but didn’t accomplish any of those compared to control. The biggest changes recorded were, not surprisingly, in the consumption of the freebies. The group that got a free jug of extra virgin olive oil delivered to their home every week really did start increasing their consumption, in part by replacing some of the refined olive oil they had been using. And those that got a half pound of free nuts sent to them every week for four years straight did start eating more nuts. Basically, the researchers designed a study to test two different Mediterranean diets versus a low fat diet, but ended up studying something very different. In essence, they studied what happens when thousands of people switch from consuming about three tablespoons of olive oil a day (half virgin) to four tablespoons of all virgin, compared to thousands of people who all the sudden go from eating about a half an ounce of nuts a day to a whole ounce, compared to thousands of people who don’t make much of a change at all. It may not have been what they were hoping for, but these are important research questions in and of themselves. With no significant differences in meat and dairy intake, there were no significant differences in saturated fat or cholesterol intake; so, no surprise there were no significant differences in their blood cholesterol levels; and so, no differences in their subsequent number of heart attacks. In the five or so years the study ran, there were 37 heart attacks in the olive oil group, 31 in the nut group and 38 in the neither group. No significant difference. Same with dying from a heart attack or stroke or from any cause—but, those in the olive oil and especially the nut group had significantly fewer strokes. All three groups were eating stroke-promoting diets; some people in all three groups had  strokes after eating these diets for years; and so ideally, we’d choose diets that can stop or reverse the disease process, but the diet with added extra virgin olive oil caused about a third fewer strokes, and adding nuts seemed to cut their stroke risk nearly in half. If this worked as well in the general population, in the U.S. alone, that would mean preventing 89,000 strokes a year. That’s would be like ten strokes an hour around the clock prevented simply by adding half an ounce of nuts to one’s daily diet. Here are some of my previous videos on the Mediterranean diet: The PREDIMED study got a bad rap because of how it was reported, but it’s an extraordinary trial that continues to churn out useful results.

A-22	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/05/the-mediterranean-diet-vs-a-completely-plant-based-diet/	The Mediterranean Diet vs. a Completely Plant-Based Diet	Recent studies have shown that higher Mediterranean diet adherence scores are associated with a significant reduction of the risk of death, heart disease, cancer, and brain disease. The problem with such population studies is that people who eat healthier may also live healthier, and so how do we know it’s their diet?  I explore this question in The Mediterranean Diet or a Whole Food Plant-Based Diet?. As the American Heart Association position states, “Before advising people to follow a Mediterranean diet, we need more studies to find out whether the diet itself or other lifestyle factors account for the lower deaths from heart disease.” How do you do that? There are ways you can control for obvious things like smoking and exercise—which many of the studies did—but ideally you’d do an interventional trial, the gold standard of nutritional science. You change people’s diets while trying to keep everything else the same and see what happens. We got that kind of trial 20 years ago with the famous Lyon Diet Heart Study where about 600 folks who had just had their first heart attack were randomized into two groups. The control group received no dietary advice, apart from whatever their doctors were telling them, while the experimental group was told to eat more of a Mediterranean-type diet, supplemented with a canola-oil based spread to give them the plant-based omega-3’s they’d normally be getting from seeds and walnuts if they actually lived on a Greek isle in the 1950’s. The Mediterranean diet group did end up taking some of the dietary advice to heart. They ate more bread, more fruit, less deli meat, less meat in general, and less butter and cream; other than that, no significant changes in diet were reported in terms of wine, olive oil, or fish consumption. So, they ate less saturated fat and cholesterol, more plant-based omega 3’s, but didn’t undergo huge dietary changes. Even so, at the end of about four years, 44 individuals from the control group had a second heart attack, either fatal or nonfatal, but only 14 suffered another attack in the group that changed their diet. So, they went from having a 4% chance of having a heart attack every year down to 1%. A cynic might say that while there was less death and disease, the Mediterranean diet continued to feed their heart disease, so much so that 14 of them suffered new heart attacks while on the diet. Yes, their disease progressed, but a lot less than the regular diet group (about four times less). But what if there was a diet that could stop or even reverse heart disease? Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn and colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic recently published a case series of 198 consecutive patients with cardiovascular disease counseled to switch to a diet composed entirely of whole plant foods. Of the 198, 177 stuck to the diet, whereas the other 21 fell off the wagon, setting up kind of a natural experiment. What happened to the 21? This was such a sick group of patients that more than half suffered from either a fatal heart attack or needed angioplasty or a heart transplant. In that same time period of about four years, of the 177 that stuck to the plant-based diet, only one had a major event as a result of worsening disease. As Dean Ornish noted in his response to the latest trial, “a Mediterranean diet is better than what most people are consuming”…but even better may be a diet based on whole plant foods. Dr. Esselstyn’s was not a randomized trial; so, it can’t be directly compared to the Lyon study, and it included very determined patients. Not everyone is willing to dramatically change their diets, even if it may literally be a matter of life or death. In which case, rather than doing nothing, eating a more Mediterranean-type diet may cut risk for heart attack survivors by about two-thirds. Cutting 99% of risk would be better if Esselstyn’s results were replicated in a controlled trial, but even a 70% drop in risk could save tens of thousands of lives every year.

A-23	http://nutritionfacts.org/2017/01/03/whats-the-mediterranean-diets-secret/	What's the Mediterranean Diet's Secret?	The Mediterranean Diet is an “in” topic nowadays in both the medical literature and the lay media. As one researcher put it, “Uncritical laudatory coverage is common, but specifics are hard to come by: What is it? Where did it come from? Why is it good? Merits are rarely detailed; possible downsides are never mentioned.” So, let’s dig in…. After World War II, the government of Greece asked the Rockefeller foundation to come in and assess the situation. Impressed by the low rates of heart disease in the region, nutrition scientist Ancel Keys—after which “K” rations were named—initiated his famous seven countries study. In this study, he found the rate of fatal heart disease on the Greek isle of Crete was 20 times lower than in the United States. They also had the lowest cancer rates and fewest deaths overall. What were they eating? Their diets were more than 90% plant-based, which may explain why coronary heart disease was such a rarity. A rarity, that is, except for a small class of rich people whose diet differed from that of the general population—they ate meat every day instead of every week or two. So, the heart of the Mediterranean diet is mainly plant-based, and low in meat and dairy, which Keys considered the “major villains in the diet” because of their saturated fat content. Unfortunately, no one is really eating the traditional Mediterranean diet anymore, even in the Mediterranean. The prevalence of coronary heart disease skyrocketed by an order of magnitude within a few decades in Crete, blamed on the increased consumption of meat and cheese at the expense of plant foods.  Everyone is talking about the Mediterranean diet, but few do it properly. People think of pizza or spaghetti with meat sauce, but while “Italian restaurants brag about the healthy Mediterranean diet, they serve a travesty of it.” If no one’s really eating this way anymore, how do you study it? Researchers came up with a variety of Mediterranean diet adherence scoring systems to see if people who are eating more Mediterranean-ish do better. You get maximum points the more plant foods you eat, and effectively you get points deducted by eating just a single serving of meat or dairy a day. So, it’s no surprise those that eat relatively higher on the scale have a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and death overall. After all, the Mediterranean diet can be considered to be a “near vegetarian” diet. “As such, it should be expected to produce the well-established health benefits of vegetarian diets.” That is, less heart disease, cancer, death, and inflammation; improved arterial function; a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes; a reduced risk for stroke, depression, and cognitive impairment. How might it work? I’ve talked about the elegant studies showing that those who eat plant-based diets have more plant-based compounds, like aspirin, circulating within their systems. Polyphenol phytonutrients in plant foods are associated with a significantly lower risk of dying. Magnesium consumption is also associated with a significantly lower risk of dying, and is found in dark green leafy vegetables, as well as fruits, beans, nuts, soy, and whole grains. Heme iron, on the other hand—the iron found in blood and muscle—acts as a pro-oxidant and appears to increase the risk of diabetes, whereas plant-based, non-heme iron appears safe. Similarly, with heart disease, animal-based iron was found to significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease, our number one killer, but not plant-based iron. The Mediterranean diet is protective compared to the Standard American Diet—no question—but any diet rich in whole plant foods and low in animal-fat consumption could be expected to confer protection against many of our leading killers. Here are some more videos on the Mediterranean Diet: For more information on heme iron, see Risk Associated With Iron Supplements.  More on magnesium is found in How Do Nuts Prevent Sudden Cardiac Death? and Mineral of the Year—Magnesium. And more on polyphenols can be seen in videos like How to Slow Brain Aging by Two Years and Juicing Removes More Than Just Fiber.

A-25	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/22/striving-for-alkaline-pee-and-acidic-poo/	Striving for Alkaline Pee & Acidic Poo	More than 30 years ago, an idea was put forward that high colonic pH promoted colorectal cancer. A high colonic pH may promote the creation of carcinogens from bile acids, a process that is inhibited once you get below a pH of about 6.5. This is supported by data which show those at higher risk for colon cancer may have a higher stool pH, and those at lower risk have a low pH. There was a dramatic difference between the two groups, with most of the high risk group over pH 8, and most of the low risk group under pH 6 (see Stool pH and Colon Cancer). This may help explain the 50-fold lower rates of colon cancer in Africa compared to America. The bacteria we have in our gut depends on what we eat. If we eat lots of fiber, then we preferentially feed the fiber eating bacteria, which give us back all sorts of health promoting substances like short-chain fatty acids that have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. More of these organic acids were found in the stools of native Africans than African Americans. More acids, so lower pH. Whereas putrefactive bacteria, eating animal protein, are able to increase stool pH by producing alkaline metabolites like ammonia. The pH of the stools of white versus black children in Africa was compared. Children were chosen because you can more readily sample their stools, particularly the rural black schoolchildren who were eating such high fiber diets—whole grains, legumes, nuts, vegetables, fruits, and wild greens—that 90% of them could produce a stool on demand. Stuffed from head to toe with plants, they could give you a stool sample at any time, just as easy as getting a urine sample. It was hard to even get access to the white kids, though, who were reluctant to participate in such investigations, even though they were given waxed cartons fitted with lids, while all the black kids got was a plate and a square of paper towel. The researchers found significantly lower fecal pH in those eating the traditional, rural plant-based diets compared to those eating the traditional Western diet, who were eating far fewer whole plant foods than the black children. But, remove some of those whole plant foods, like switch their corn for white bread for just a few days and their stool pH goes up, and add whole plant foods like an extra five to seven servings of fruit every day, and their stool pH goes down even further and gets more acidic. It makes sense because when you ferment fruits, veggies, and grains, they turn sour, like vinegar, sauerkraut, or sourdough, because good bacteria like lactobacillus produce organic acids like lactic acid. Those who eat a lot of plants have more of those good bugs. So, using the purple cabbage test highlighted in my video, Testing Your Diet with Pee & Purple Cabbage, we want blue pee, but pink poo. If you compare the fecal samples of those eating vegetarian or vegan to those eating standard diets, plant-based diets appear to shift the makeup of the bacteria in our gut, resulting in a significantly lower stool pH, and the more plant-based, the lower the pH dropped. It’s like a positive feedback loop: fiber-eating bacteria produce the acids to create the pH at which fiber-eating bacteria thrive while suppressing the group of less beneficial bugs. It might take even as little as two weeks to bring stool pH down on a plant-based diet. In a study published in the British Journal of Cancer, a dozen volunteers carefully selected for their trustworthiness and randomized to sequentially go on regular, vegetarian, or vegan diets and two weeks in, a significant drop in fecal pH was achieved eating completely plant-based. But there are differing qualities of plant-based diets. For example, the two groups followed in the study I mentioned earlier had dramatically different stool pH, yet both groups were vegetarian. The high risk group was eating mostly refined grains, very little fiber, whereas the low risk group was eating whole grains and beans, packed with fiber for our fiber-friendly flora to munch on. Just as a “reduction of high serum cholesterol contributes to the avoidance of coronary heart disease,” a fall in the fecal pH value may contribute to the avoidance of bowel cancer. Similarly, eating more whole plant foods may also help us avoid bowel cancer, through the same means.

A-26	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/20/how-to-prevent-ulcerative-colitis-with-diet/	How to Prevent Ulcerative Colitis with Diet	What has driven the dramatic increase in prevalence of the inflammatory bowel disease Crohn’s disease in societies that rapidly westernized—a disease practically unknown just a century ago? What has changed in our internal and external environment that has led to the appearance of this horrible disease? Japan suffered one of the most dramatic increases, and out of all the changing dietary components, animal protein appeared to be the strongest factor. There was an exponential increase in newly diagnosed Crohn’s patients and daily animal protein intake, whereas the greater the vegetable protein, the fewer the cases of Crohn’s, which is consistent with data showing a more plant-based diet may be successful in both preventing and treating Crohn’s disease (See Preventing Crohn’s Disease With Diet and Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease). But what about other inflammatory bowel diseases? In the largest study of its kind, shown in my video Preventing Ulcerative Colitis with Diet, 60,000 people were followed for more than a decade. Researchers found that high total protein intake—specifically animal protein—was associated with a significantly increased risk of the other big inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis. It wasn’t just protein in general, but the “association between high protein intake and inflammatory bowel disease risk was restricted to animal protein.” Since World War II, animal protein intake has increased not only in Japan but also in all developed countries. This increase in animal protein consumption is thought to explain some of the increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in the second half of the 20th century. Other studies found this as well, but why? What’s the difference between animal protein and plant protein? Animal proteins tend to have more sulfur containing amino acids like methionine, which bacteria in our gut can turn into the toxic rotten egg smell gas, hydrogen sulfide. Emerging evidence suggests that sulfur compounds may play a role in the development of ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum characterized by bloody diarrhea. The first hint as to the importance of our gut flora was in the 1970’s when “analysis of stools showed that their bulk was made up of mostly bacteria, not undigested material.” We’re pushing out trillions of bacteria a day and they just keep multiplying and multiplying. They do wonderful things for us like create the protective compound, butyrate, from the fiber we eat, but unfortunately, the bacteria may also elaborate toxic products from food residues, such as hydrogen sulfide, “in response to a high-meat diet.” Hydrogen sulfide is a bacterially derived cell poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. We had always assumed that sulfide generation in the colon is driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino acids, but we didn’t know for sure until a study from Cambridge was published. Researchers had folks eat five different diets each with escalating meat contents from vegetarian all the way up to a steak each day. They found that the more meat one ate, the more sulfide; ten times more meat meant ten times more sulfide. They concluded that “dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine.” Hydrogen sulfide can then act as a free radical and damage our DNA at concentrations way below what our poor colon lining is exposed to on a routine basis, which may help explain why diets higher in meat and lower in fiber may produce so-called “fecal water” that causes about twice as much DNA damage. Fecal water is like when researchers make a tea from someone’s stool. The biology of sulfur in the human gut has escaped serious attention until recently. Previously, it was just thought of as the rotten egg smell in malodorous gas, but the increase in sulfur compounds in response to a supplement of animal protein is not only of interest in the field of flatology—that is, the formal study of farts—but may also be of importance in the development of ulcerative colitis.

A-28	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/13/whats-the-optimal-cholesterol-level/	What's the Optimal Cholesterol Level?	No matter where we live, how old we are or what we look like, health researchers from the Institute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health have discovered that 90% of the chance of having a first heart attack “can be attributed to nine modifiable risk factors.” The nine factors that could save our lives include: smoking, too much bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, abdominal obesity, stress, a lack of daily fruit and veggie consumption, as well as a lack of daily exercise. Dr. William Clifford Roberts, Executive Director of Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute and long-time Editor in Chief of the American Journal of Cardiology, is convinced, however, that atherosclerosis has a single cause—namely cholesterol—and that the other so-called atherosclerotic risk factors are only contributory at most. In other words, we could be stressed, overweight, smoking, diabetic couch potatoes, but if our cholesterol is low enough, there may just not be enough cholesterol in our blood stream to infiltrate our artery walls and trigger the disease. Thus, the only absolute prerequisite for a fatal or nonfatal atherosclerotic event like a heart attack is an elevated cholesterol level. It was not appreciated until recently “that the average blood cholesterol level in the United States, the so-called normal level, was actually abnormal,” accelerating the blockages in our arteries and putting a large fraction of the normal population at risk. That’s cited as one of the reasons the cholesterol controversy lasted so long—an “unwillingness to accept the notion that a very large fraction of our population actually has an unhealthily high cholesterol level.” Normal cholesterol levels may be fatal cholesterol levels. The optimal “bad cholesterol” (LDL) level is 50 to 70. Accumulating data from multiple lines of evidence consistently demonstrate that that’s where a physiologically normal LDL level would be. That appears to be the threshold above which atherosclerosis and heart attacks develop. That’s what we start out at birth with, that’s what fellow primates have, and that’s the level seen in populations free of the heart disease epidemic. One can also look at all the big randomized controlled cholesterol lowering trials. In my video, Optimal Cholesterol Level, you can see graphing of the progression of atherosclerosis versus LDL cholesterol. More cholesterol means more atherosclerosis, but if we draw a line down through the points, we can estimate that the LDL level at which there is zero progression is around 70. We can do the same with the studies preventing heart attacks. Zero coronary heart disease events might be reached down around 55, and those who’ve already had a heart attack and are trying to prevent a second one might need to push LDL levels even lower. Atherosclerosis is endemic in our population in part because the average person’s LDL level is up around 130, approximately twice the normal physiologic level. The reason the federal government doesn’t recommend everyone shoot for under 100 is that despite the lower risk accompanying more optimal cholesterol levels, the intensity of clinical intervention required to achieve such levels for everyone in the population would “financially overload the health care system. Drug usage would rise enormously.” But, they’re assuming drugs are the only way to get our LDL that low. Those eating really healthy plant-based diets may hit the optimal cholesterol target without even trying, naturally nailing under 70. The reason given by the federal government for not advocating for what the science shows is best was that it might frustrate the public, “who would have difficulty maintaining a lower level,” but maybe the public’s greatest frustration would come from not being informed of the optimal diet for health. It’s imperative for everyone to understand Dr. Rose’s sick population concept, which I introduced in When Low Risk Means High Risk. What about large fluffy LDL cholesterol versus small and dense?

A-29	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/08/reducing-glycotoxin-intake-to-help-reduce-brain-loss/	Reducing Glycotoxin Intake to Help Reduce Brain Loss	Each of us has about six billion miles of DNA. How does our body keep it from getting all tangled up? There are special proteins called histones, which act like spools with DNA as the thread. Enzymes called sirtuins wrap the DNA around the histones and by doing so, silence whatever genes were in that stretch of DNA, hence their name SIRtuins, which stands for silencing information regulator. Although they were discovered only about a decade ago, the study of sirtuins “has become one of the most promising areas of biomedicine,” since they appear to be involved in promoting healthy aging and longevity. Suppression of this key host defense is considered a central feature of Alzheimer’s disease, as shown in Reducing Glycotoxin Intake to Prevent Alzheimer’s. Autopsies of Alzheimer’s victims reveal that loss of sirtuin activity is closely associated with the accumulation of the plaques and tangles in the brain that are characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease. Sirtuin appears to activate pathways that steer the brain away from the formation of plaque and tangle proteins. “Because a decrease in sirtuin activity can clearly have deleterious effects” on nerve health, researchers are trying to come up with drugs to increase sirtuin activity, but why not just prevent its suppression in the first place? Glycotoxins in our food suppress sirtuin activity, also known as advanced glycation end products, or AGE’s. Our modern diet includes excessive AGE’s, which can be neurotoxic. High levels in the blood may predict cognitive decline over time. If you measure the urine levels of glycotoxins flowing through the bodies of older adults, those with the highest levels went on to suffer the greatest cognitive decline over the subsequent nine years. As we age, our brain literally shrinks. In our 60’s and 70’s, we lose an average of five cubic centimeters of total brain tissue volume every year, but some people lose more than others. Brain atrophy may be reduced in very healthy individuals, and a few people don’t lose any brain at all. Normally, we lose about 2% of brain volume every year, but that’s just the average. Although the average brain loss for folks in their 70’s and 80’s was 2.1%, some lost more, some lost less, and some men and women lost none at all over a period of four years. Researchers in Australia provided the first evidence linking AGEs with this kind of cerebral brain loss. So, limiting one’s consumption of these compounds may end up having significant public health benefits. Because sirtuin deficiency is both preventable and reversible by dietary AGE reduction, a therapeutic strategy that includes eating less AGE’s may offer a new strategy to combat the epidemic of Alzheimer’s. Some glycotoxins are produced internally, particularly in diabetics, but anyone can get them from smoking and eating, particularly foods high in fat and protein cooked at high temperatures. In my video, Avoiding a Sugary Grave, I listed the 15 foods most contaminated with glycotoxins; mostly chicken, but also pork, beef, and fish, which may help explain why those that eat the most meat may have triple the risk of getting dementia compared to long-time vegetarians. Note there are some relatively high fat and protein plant foods such as nuts and soy products; so, I no longer recommend toasting nuts and would steer clear of roasted tofu.

A-30	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/06/why-some-like-cilantro-and-others-hate-it/	Why Some Like Cilantro & Others Hate It	One sign of changing U.S. demographics is that salsa has replaced ketchup as America’s #1 table condiment. One of the popular salsa ingredients is cilantro, described as one of the “most polarizing and divisive food ingredients known.” Some people love it; some people hate it. What’s interesting is that the lovers and the haters appear to experience the taste differently. Individuals who like cilantro may describe it as “fresh, fragrant or citrusy, whereas those who dislike cilantro report that it tastes like soap, mold, dirt, or bugs.” I don’t know how people know what bugs taste like, but rarely are polarizing opinions about flavors so extreme. Maybe it’s genetic. Different ethnic groups do seem to have different rates of cilantro dislike, with Ashkenazi Jews scoring highest on the cilantro hate-o-meter (see The Cilantro Gene). Another clue came from twin studies, that show that identical twins tend to share cilantro preferences, whereas regular fraternal twins do not have such a strong correlation. Our genetic code is so big, though, containing about three billion letters, that to find some cilantro gene you’d have to analyze the DNA of like 10,000 people, and obviously genetic researchers have better things to do…or maybe not. Researchers performed a genome-wide association study among 14,000 participants who reported whether cilantro tasted soapy, with replication in a distinct set of 11,000 people who declared whether they liked cilantro or not. And lo and behold they found a spot on chromosome 11 that seemed to be a match. What’s there? A gene called OR6A2 that enables us to smell certain chemicals like E-(2)-Decenal, a primary constituent of cilantro and also…the defensive secretions of stink bugs. So, maybe cilantro does taste like bugs! But, cilantro lovers may be genetic mutants that have an inability to smell the unpleasant compound. That may actually be an advantage, though, since cilantro is healthy stuff. In fact, that’s the justification to do these kinds of studies: to see why some people don’t like the taste of healthy foods. Are the cilantro haters really missing out on much, though? Mother nature has been described as the “oldest and most comprehensive pharmacy of all time,” and cilantro—called coriander around most of the world—is one of nature’s oldest herbal prescriptions, credited with anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-anxiety, and anti-epilepsy properties. However, these are all from preclinical studies, meaning studies done on cells in a test tube or lab animals. Studies like the “Anti-Despair Activity of Cilantro…” in which researchers placed animals in a “despair apparatus” (you don’t want to know). Finally, though, there had been a human study, on the anti-arthritis potential of cilantro. There was an earlier study performed in Germany of a lotion made out of cilantro seeds showing it could decrease the redness of a sunburn, demonstrating it had some anti-inflammatory effects (although not as much as an over-the-counter steroid, hydrocortisone, or prescription strength steroid cream). If the cilantro plant is anti-inflammatory, why not give it to people with osteoarthritis and see if it helps? Researchers gave about 20 sprigs of cilantro daily for two months, and reported a significant drop in ESR—a nonspecific indicator of inflammation—in the cilantro group. How did the patients do clinically, though? The study didn’t say, but it did report a rather remarkable 50% drop in uric acid levels, suggesting that huge amounts of cilantro may be useful for those suffering from gout. The cilantro lovers/haters factoid reminds me of the video Pretty in Pee-nk about the phenomenon of “beeturia,” pink urine after beet consumption seen in some people. For those that don’t mind the taste of bugs, I have some nutritional info in Good Grub: The Healthiest Meat and Bug Appétit: Barriers to Entomophagy.

A-31	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/12/01/improving-employee-diets-could-save-companies-millions/	Improving Employee Diets Could Save Companies Millions	The food, alcohol, and tobacco industries have been blamed for “manufacturing epidemics” of chronic disease, but they’re just trying to sell more product like everyone else. And so, if that means distorting science, creating front groups, compromising scientists, blocking public health policies… they’re just trying to protect their business. It’s not about customer satisfaction, but shareholder satisfaction. How else could we have tobacco companies, for example, “continuing to produce products that kill one in two of their most loyal customers?” Civil society organizations concerned with public health have earned a reputation for being “anti-industry,” but the issue is not industry, but that sector of industry whose products are harmful to public health. We like the broccoli industry. In fact, the corporate world might end up leading the lifestyle medicine revolution. As shown in my video, Plant-Based Workplace Intervention, the annual cost attributable to obesity alone among full-time employees is estimated at 70 billion dollars, primarily because obese employees are not as productive on the job. Having healthy employees is good for the bottom-line. Every dollar spent on wellness programs may offer a $3 return on investment. And if you track the market performance of companies that strive to nurture a culture of health, they appear to outperform their competition.  That’s why companies like GEICO are exploring workplace dietary interventions (see my video, Slimming the Gecko). The remarkable success at GEICO headquarters led to an expansion of the program at corporate offices across the country, with test sites from San Diego to Macon, Georgia. Given that previous workplace studies have found that workers who ate a lot of animal protein had nearly five times the odds of obesity, whereas those that ate mostly plant protein appeared protected, obese and diabetic employees were asked to follow a plant-based diet of whole grains, vegetables, beans, and fruit while avoiding meat, dairy, and eggs. Compliance wasn’t great. Fewer than half really got their animal product consumption down, but there were definitely improvements such as significant reductions in saturated fat, an increase in protective nutrients, and even noted weight loss, lower blood cholesterol levels, and better blood sugar control in diabetics. And this was with no calorie counting, no portion control, and no exercise component. The weight reduction appears to result from feeling fuller earlier, due to higher dietary fiber intake. The difference in weight loss could also be the result of an increase in the thermic effect of food, allowing a small extra edge for weight loss in the vegan group. Those eating plant-based diets tend to burn off more calories in heat. Eating plants appears to boost metabolism. This may be due to increased insulin sensitivity in cells, allowing cells to metabolize carbohydrates more quickly rather than storing them as body fat. “As a result, vegan diets have been shown to increase postprandial calorie burn by about 16%, up to three hours after consuming a meal.” Imagine how much money companies that self-insure their employees could save!

A-32	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/24/reduce-saturated-fat-intake-to-protect-your-pancreas/	Reduce Saturated Fat Intake to Protect Your Pancreas	The reason those eating plant-based diets have less fat buildup in their muscle cells and less insulin resistance may be because saturated fats appear to impair blood sugar control the most. The association between fat and insulin resistance is now widely accepted. Insulin resistance is due to so-called ectopic fat accumulation, the buildup of fat in places it’s not supposed to be, like within our muscle cells. But not all fats affect the muscles the same. The type of fat, saturated vs. unsaturated, is critical. Saturated fats like palmitate, found mostly in meat, dairy, and eggs, cause insulin resistance. But oleate, found mostly in nuts, olives, and avocados, may actually improve insulin sensitivity. What makes saturated fat bad? Saturated fat causes more toxic breakdown products and mitochondrial dysfunction, and increases oxidative stress, free radicals, and inflammation, establishing a vicious cycle of events in which saturated fat induces free radicals, causes dysfunction in the little power plants within our muscle cells (mitochondria)—which then causes an increase in free radical production, and an impairment of insulin signaling. I explain this in my video Lipotoxicity: How Saturated Fat Raises Blood Sugar. Fat cells filled with saturated fat activate an inflammatory response to a far greater extent. This increased inflammation from saturated fat has been demonstrated to raise insulin resistance through free radical production. Saturated fat also has been shown to have a direct effect on skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Accumulation of saturated fat increases the amount of diacylglycerol in the muscles, which has been demonstrated to have a potent effect on muscle insulin resistance. You can take muscle biopsies from people and correlate the saturated fat buildup in their muscles with insulin resistance, the cause of type 2 diabetes.  While monounsaturated fats are more likely to be detoxified or safely stored away, saturated fats create toxic breakdown products like ceramide that causes lipotoxicity. Lipo– meaning fat, as in liposuction. This fat toxicity in our muscles is a well-known concept in the explanation of triggers for insulin resistance. I’ve talked about the role saturated and trans fats contribute to the progression of other diseases, like autoimmune diseases, cancer, and heart disease. But, they can also cause insulin resistance, the underlying cause of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In the human diet, saturated fats are derived from animal sources, while trans fats originate in meat and milk, in addition to partially hydrogenated and refined vegetable oils. That’s why experimentally shifting people from animal fats to plant fats can improve insulin sensitivity. In a study done by Swedish researchers, insulin sensitivity was impaired on the diet with added butterfat, but not on the diet with added olive fat. We know prolonged exposure of our muscles to high levels of fat leads to severe insulin resistance, with saturated fats demonstrated to be the worst. But, they don’t just lead to inhibition of insulin signaling, the activation of inflammatory pathways, and the increase in free radicals; they also cause an alteration in gene expression. This can lead to a suppression of key mitochondrial enzymes, like carnitine palmitoyltransferase, which finally solves the mystery of why those eating vegetarian have a 60% higher expression of that fat-burning enzyme. They’re eating less saturated fat. So, do those eating plant-based diets have less fat clogging their muscles, and less insulin resistance too? There haven’t been any data available regarding the insulin sensitivity, or inside-the-muscle-cell fat of those eating vegan or vegetarian—until now. Researchers at the Imperial College of London compared the insulin resistance and muscle fat of vegans versus omnivores. Those eating plant-based diets have the unfair advantage of being much slimmer; so, they found omnivores who were as skinny as vegans, to see if plant-based diets had a direct benefit—as opposed to indirectly pulling fat out of the muscles by helping people lose weight in general. They found significantly less fat trapped in the muscle cells of vegans compared to omnivores at the same body weight, better insulin sensitivity, better blood sugar levels, better insulin levels, and, excitingly, significantly improved beta cell function (the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin). They conclude that eating plant-based is not only expected to be cardioprotective, helping prevent our #1 killer, heart disease, but that plant-based diets are beta cell-protective as well, helping also to prevent our seventh leading cause of death, diabetes. This is the third of a three-part series, starting with What Causes Insulin Resistance? and The Spillover Effect Links Obesity to Diabetes. Even if saturated fat weren’t associated with heart disease, its effects on pancreatic function and insulin resistance in the muscles would be enough to warrant avoiding it. Despite popular press accounts, saturated fat intake remains the primary modifiable determinant of LDL cholesterol, a leading risk factor for our leading killer–heart disease. See The Saturated Fat Studies: Buttering Up the Public and The Saturated Fat Studies: Set Up to Fail. How low should we shoot for in terms of saturated fat intake?

A-33	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/22/how-a-low-carb-diet-is-metabolically-like-being-obese/	How a Low-Carb Diet is Metabolically Like Being Obese	Free fatty acids (meaning fat circulating in the bloodstream not packaged into triglycerides) result in inflammation, toxic fat breakdown products, and oxidative stress, which can gum up the insulin receptor pathway and lead to insulin resistance in our muscles. Insulin resistance is what causes prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. I explain the process in my video What Causes Insulin Resistance? As the level of fat in the blood rises, the body’s ability to clear sugar from the blood drops dramatically. Where does this fat in our blood that’s wreaking all this havoc come from? It comes from the fat that we eat and from the fat that we wear. The number of fat cells we have stays constant in adulthood. The way researchers figured that out is by measuring the amount of radioactive carbon still trapped in our DNA from all the nuclear bomb tests. After massive weight loss, our fat cells shrink as they offload fat, but the number stays the same. Conversely, when we gain weight, our fat cells stretch as we pack more and more into each individual fat cell. So, when our belly, butt, or thighs get big, we’re not adding more fat cells, we’re just cramming more fat into each cell. At a certain point, our cells become so bloated that they spill fat back into the bloodstream. This is called the spillover effect. Not only does an obese person have more fat, but they’re constantly spilling that fat into their bloodstream. So, that could be the link between obesity and diabetes. Fat is spilling out from our fat cells and gets lodged in our muscle cells, leading to the insulin resistance that promotes the onset of type 2 diabetes. I show this in my video The Spillover Effect Links Obesity to Diabetes. The fat can also enter our bloodstream through our mouths. If you put people on a low-carb diet, fat builds up in their muscles within two hours and insulin sensitivity drops. And the more fat found in the muscles, the lower the ability to clear sugar from the blood. It doesn’t take years for this to happen, just hours after fatty foods go into our mouths. A fat-rich diet can increase fat in the blood, and this increase is accompanied by a decrease in insulin sensitivity. Studies clearly demonstrate that fat in the blood directly inhibits glucose transport and usage in our muscles, which is responsible for clearing about 85% of the glucose out of the blood. These findings indicate that fat consumption can play an important role in the development of insulin resistance. Normally, we only have 10 to 50 micromoles of free fat floating around in our blood stream at any one time, but those who are obese have between 60 to 80. But, we can reach 80 just eating a high fat diet. So, a skinny person eating a low-carb diet can have the same level of fat in their blood that obese people do. Similarly, being obese is like eating some horrible bacon and butter diet all day, because obese persons are constantly spilling fat into their bloodstream, no matter what goes in their mouths. Are all types of fat the same? Find out the answer in my video Lipotoxicity: How Saturated Fat Raises Blood Sugar. The fat leaking into our bloodstream may also contain fat-soluble pollutants that accumulated from our diet: Pollutants in Salmon and Our Own Fat. The spillover effect may also help explain the increased heart disease risk associated with obesity: Low Carb Diets and Coronary Blood Flow.

In 1985, an influential article highlighted in my video The Problem With the Paleo Diet Argument was published proposing that our chronic diseases stem from a disconnect between what our bodies ate while evolving during the Stone Age (about 2 million years ago) and what we’re stuffing our face with today. The proposal advocated for a return towards a hunter-gatherer type diet of lean meat, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. It’s reasonable to assume our nutritional requirements were established in the prehistoric past. However, the question of which prehistoric past we should emulate remains. Why just the last 2 million? We’ve been evolving for about 20 million years since our last common great ape ancestor, during which our nutrient requirements and digestive physiology were set down. Therefore our hunter-gatherer days at the tail end probably had little effect. What were we eating for the first 90% of our evolution? What the rest of the great apes ended up eating—95 percent or more plants. This may explain why we’re so susceptible to heart disease. For most of human evolution, cholesterol may have been virtually absent from the diet. No bacon, butter, or trans fats; and massive amounts of fiber, which pulls cholesterol from the body. This could have been a problem since our body needs a certain amount of cholesterol, but our bodies evolved not only to make cholesterol, but also to preserve it and recycle it. If we think of the human body as a cholesterol-conserving machine, then plop it into the modern world of bacon, eggs, cheese, chicken, pork, and pastry, it’s no wonder artery-clogging heart disease is our #1 cause of death. What used to be adaptive for 90% of our evolution—holding on to cholesterol at all costs since we weren’t getting much in our diet—is today maladaptive, a liability leading to the clogging of our arteries. Our bodies just can’t handle it. As the editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Cardiology noted 25 years ago, no matter how much fat and cholesterol carnivores eat, they do not develop atherosclerosis. We can feed a dog 500 eggs worth of cholesterol and they just wag their tail; a dog’s body is used to eating and getting rid of excess cholesterol. Conversely, within months a fraction of that cholesterol can start clogging the arteries of animals adapted to eating a more plant-based diet. Even if our bodies were designed by natural selection to eat mostly fruit, greens and seeds for 90% of our evolution, why didn’t we better adapt to meat-eating in the last 10%, during the Paleolithic? We’ve had nearly 2 million years to get used to all that extra saturated fat and cholesterol. If a lifetime of eating like that clogs up nearly everyone’s arteries, why didn’t the genes of those who got heart attacks die off and get replaced by those that could live to a ripe old age with clean arteries regardless of what they ate? Because most didn’t survive into old age.  Most prehistoric peoples didn’t live long enough to get heart attacks. When the average life expectancy is 25 years old, then the genes that get passed along are those that can live to reproductive age by any means necessary, and that means not dying of starvation. The more calories in food, the better. Eating lots of bone marrow and brains, human or otherwise, would have a selective advantage (as would discovering a time machine stash of Twinkies for that matter!). If we only have to live long enough to get our kids to puberty to pass along our genes, then we don’t have to evolve any protections against the ravages of chronic disease. To find a population nearly free of chronic disease in old age, we don’t have to go back a million years. In the 20th century, networks of missionary hospitals in rural Africa found coronary artery disease virtually absent, and not just heart disease, but high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, common cancers, and more. In a sense, these populations in rural China and Africa were eating the type of diet we’ve been eating for 90% of the last 20 million years, a diet almost exclusively of plant foods. How do we know it was their diet and not something else? In the 25 year update to their original paleo paper, the authors tried to clarify that they did not then and do not now propose that people adopt a particular diet just based on what our ancient ancestors ate. Dietary recommendations must be put to the test. That’s why the pioneering research from Pritikin, Ornish, and Esselstyn is so important, showing that plant-based diets can not only stop heart disease but have been proven to reverse it in the majority of patients. Indeed, it’s the only diet that ever has. For more on the absence of Western diseases in plant-based rural populations, see for example: I’ve touched on “paleo” diets in the past: In health, 	-	Africa,bacon,blood pressure,brains,butter,cancer,cardiovascular disease,cheese,chicken,China,cholesterol,chronic diseases,diabetes,Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn,Dr. Dean Ornish,eggs,evolution,fiber,fruit,greens,heart disease,high blood pressure,hypertension,low-carb diets,meat,Mioscene,nutrition myths,nuts,paleolithic diets,plant-based diets,pork,prehistoric diets,Pritikin,seeds,stroke,trans fats,Twinkies,vegetables	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/grains/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2220599,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10906529,http://ncp.sagepub.com/content/23/5/464,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2981409,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-problem-with-the-paleo-diet-argument/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14527636	
A-35	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/10/medical-care-the-third-leading-cause-of-death/	Medical Care: The Third Leading Cause of Death	An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but a pound isn’t that heavy. Why change our diet and lifestyle when we can just wait and let modern medicine fix us up? In my video The Actual Benefit of Diet vs. Drugs, I noted that patients tend to wildly overestimate the ability of cancer screening and cholesterol-lowering medications to prevent disease. Surveyed patients report that if they were told the truth about how little they’d benefit from taking drugs, such as cholesterol-lowering, blood pressure, and blood-thinning, every day for the rest of their lives, 90% said they wouldn’t even bother. The reason we should eat healthier, rather than just counting on a medical technofix, is that we may hold this same overconfidence for treatment, too. In a massive study of more than 200,000 trials, researchers discovered that pills and procedures can certainly help, but genuine, very large effects with extensive support from substantial evidence appear to be rare in medicine. Further, large benefits for mortality—making people live significantly longer—are almost entirely nonexistent. Modern medicine is great for acute conditions—broken bones and curing infections—but for chronic disease, our leading causes of death and disability, we don’t have much to offer. In fact, we sometimes do more harm than good. In my Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death presentation, I noted that side effects from prescription drugs kill an estimated 100,000 Americans every year, making medical care the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. There are another 7,000 deaths from getting the wrong medicine by mistake and 20,000 deaths from other errors in hospitals. Hospitals are dangerous places. An additional 99,000 of us die from hospital-acquired infections. But can we really blame doctors for those deaths, though? We can when they don’t wash their hands. We’ve known since the 1840’s that the best way to prevent hospital-acquired infections is through handwashing, yet compliance rates among healthcare workers rarely exceed 50%, and doctors are the worst, as highlighted in my video Why Prevention is Worth a Ton of Cure. Even in a medical intensive care unit with a “contact precautions” sign, signaling a particularly high risk patient, less than a quarter of doctors were found to wash their hands. Many physicians greeted the horrendous mortality data due to medical error with disbelief and concern that the information would undermine public trust. But if doctors still won’t even wash their hands, how much trust do we deserve? We could go in for a simple operation and come out with a life-threatening infection, or not come out at all. 12,000 more die from surgeries that were unnecessary in the first place. For those keeping score, that’s 225,000 people dead from iatrogenic (“relating to medical care”) causes. And that’s mostly just for patients in a hospital. In an outpatient setting, side effects from prescription drugs send millions to the hospital and result in perhaps 199,000 additional deaths. This is not including all those non-fatally injured (such as the case where doctors accidentally amputated the tip of a man’s penis. Oops). These estimates are on the low end. The Institute of Medicine estimated that deaths from medical errors may kill up to 98,000 Americans. That would bump us up to 284,000 dead. Even if we use the lower estimate, the medical profession constitutes the third leading cause of death in the United States. It goes heart disease, cancer, then… me. One respondent pointed out that it was misleading to call medicine the third leading cause of death since many of those we kill also had heart disease or cancer. It’s not like doctors are out there gunning down healthy people. Only people on medications are killed by medication errors or side effects. You have to be in the hospital to be killed by a hospital error.  To which I respond: Exactly. That’s why lifestyle medicine is so important. The most common reasons people are on drugs and in hospitals is for diseases that can be prevented with a healthy diet and lifestyle. The best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical care is to not get sick in the first place. For more background on how scandalous our handwashing history has been, see my Q&A: What about Semmelweis and medicine’s shameful handwashing history? It’s truly an unbelievable story.

A-36	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/08/how-well-do-cholesterol-lowering-drugs-actually-work/	How Well Do Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs Actually Work?	One of the reasons people may undervalue diet and lifestyle changes is an overconfidence in the ability of pills and procedures to prevent disease. For example, people tend to wildly overestimate the power of things like mammograms and colonoscopies to prevent deaths from breast and bowel cancer, or the power of drugs like Fosamax to prevent hip fractures, or the power of cholesterol drugs to prevent fatal heart attacks. Patients believe statin drugs like Lipitor are about 100 times more effective than they actually are in preventing heart attacks. Studies show most people wouldn’t take multiple blood pressure medications if they knew the truth. For most people, the chance of benefit is normally less than 5 percent over five years for cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood thinning drugs. Patients don’t want to take drugs unless they have at least a one in five chance—even those who just had a heart attack. It’s no wonder, then, that doctors seldom share these figures. Informing patients of the percentage chance of benefit from preventive drug strategies would likely substantially reduce the likelihood that patients would agree to take the drugs every day for the rest of their lives. For the individual, not being informed of the low percentage chance of benefit from these preventive drug strategies is unlikely to be detrimental; after all, there’s a 95 percent chance it won’t do anything for them. But for the population at large, being informed would make a difference; so, doctors and drug companies oversell the benefits by conveniently not mentioning how tiny they actually are, knowing most patients wouldn’t take them if doctors divulged the truth. To practice non-lifestyle medicine is to practice deceptive medicine.  The best that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs appear to do is an absolute risk reduction of 3.1 percent over six years. If Dr. Esselstyn’s work can be replicated in a randomized, controlled trial, then a whole foods plant-based diet will have been shown to work twenty times better, an absolute risk reduction of 60 percent after less than four years. In Esselstyn’s study, 99.4 percent of high-risk patients that stuck with the diet avoided major cardiac events, such as death from heart attack. When we have to decide whether we want to go diet versus drugs, we’re not making a choice between eating healthy to prevent a heart attack or taking a pill to prevent a heart attack. Because in 97 percent of cases in the near-term, pills don’t do anything. We’re risking side effects for nothing, whereas if we treat the underlying root cause of the disease by eating a healthy, cholesterol-free diet, we may even reverse the progression of the disease, as seen in my video The Actual Benefit of Diet vs. Drugs. If we stop eating an artery-clogging diet, our bodies can start dissolving that plaque away, opening up arteries in some cases without drugs or surgery. A healthy whole food plant-based diet by itself may work 20 times better than drugs to combat our #1 killer. Now, that’s something doctors may want to tell their patients. Yes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but a pound isn’t that heavy—why change our diet and lifestyle when we can just wait and let modern medicine fix us up? Turns out we overestimate the efficacy of treatment as well, the subject of my video Why Prevention is Worth a Ton of Cure. Sometimes, preventive medicine procedures can even be harmful.

A-37	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/11/01/flax-seeds-can-have-profound-effect-on-hypertension/	Flax Seeds Can Have Profound Effect on Hypertension	A recent article in the journal, Meat Science, acknowledged that a sector of the population perceives meat as a food that is detrimental to their health because of studies associating meat consumption with heart disease and cancer. So, the article continues, meat consumers may look for healthier food alternatives as a means to maintain good health, which represents a good opportunity for the meat industry to develop some new products. The industry felt that natural foods could be added to meat to reach those health-oriented consumers by boosting antioxidants levels, for example. Foods like flax seeds and tomatoes are healthy, associated with reduced risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. So, by making flax-y tomato burgers, they figure they can reduce saturated fat intake and maybe eat less sugar somehow. Wouldn’t it be easier to just cut out the middle-cow and eat flax seeds ourselves? Flax seeds have been described as a “miraculous defense against some critical maladies.” I’m a fan of flax, but this title seemed a bit over-exuberant; I figured something just got lost in translation, but then I found a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial—you know how hard that is in a nutrition study? For drugs, it’s easy: you have two identical looking pills, one’s active, one’s placebo, and until the end of the study, neither the researcher nor the patient has any idea which is which, hence “double blind.” But people tend to notice what they’re eating. So, how did they sneak a quarter cup of ground flax seeds into half of the people’s diets without them knowing? They created all these various flax or placebo containing foods, and even added bran and molasses to match the color and texture; so, it was all a big secret until six months later when they broke the code to see who ate which. Why test it on hypertension? Because having a systolic blood pressure over 115—that’s the top number—may be the single most important determinant for death in the world today. If you take a bunch of older folks, most of them on an array of blood pressure pills, and don’t improve their diet at all, despite the drugs, they may start out on average hypertensive and stay hypertensive six months later. But those who were unknowingly eating ground flaxseeds every day, dropped their systolic blood pressure about ten points, and their diastolic, the lower number, by about seven points. That might not sound like a lot, but a drop like that could cut stroke risk 46 percent and heart disease 29 percent, and that ten point drop in the top number could have a similar effect on strokes and heart attacks. And for those that started out over 140, they got a 15-point drop. In summary, flaxseed induced one of the most potent antihypertensive effects ever achieved by a dietary intervention. In other words, the magnitude of this decrease in blood pressure demonstrated by dietary flaxseed is as good or better than other nutritional interventions and comparable to many drugs, which can have serious side effects. And they’re not exaggerating about the comparable to drugs bit. The flax dropped systolic and diastolic up to 15 and 7. Compare that to powerful ACE inhibitors, like Vasotec, which may only drop pressures five and two, and calcium channel blockers, like Norvasc or Cardizem, which drop pressures eight and three. Side effects of these drugs include a large list of serious medical issues, as seen in my video Flax Seeds for Hypertension, compared to the side effect of flax seeds, “its pleasant nutty flavor.” During the six-month trial, there were strokes and heart attacks in both groups, though. Even if the flax seeds can cut risk in half, any avoidable risk is unacceptable. Isn’t high blood pressure just inevitable as we get older? No – the prevalence of hypertension does increase dramatically with age, but not for everyone. People who eat more plant-based diets or keep their salt intake low enough tend not to exhibit any change in blood pressure with advancing age. It’s always better to prevent the disease in the first place. And that’s not all flax can do. Check out: Hibiscus tea may help with high blood pressure as well: Hibiscus Tea vs. Plant-Based Diets for Hypertension Diet can also play an important role in preventing heart disease (How Not to Die from Heart Disease and One in a Thousand: Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic) and diabetes (How Not to Die from Diabetes and Plant-Based Diets and Diabetes).

A-38	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/27/how-may-eating-plants-help-prevent-alzheimers-disease/	How May Eating Plants Help Prevent Alzheimer's Disease?	Intake of saturated fats and added sugars, two of the primary components of a modern Western diet, is linked with the development of Alzheimer’s disease. There has been a global shift in dietary composition, from traditional diets high in starches and fiber, to what has been termed the Western diet, high in fat and sugar, low in whole, plant foods. What’s so great about fruits and vegetables? Plant-derived foods contain thousands of compounds with antioxidant properties, some of which can traverse the blood-brain barrier and may have neuroprotective effects by assisting with antioxidant defense. There’s this concept of “brain rust,” that neurodegenerative diseases arise from excess oxidative stress. But Nature has gifted humankind with a plethora of plants—fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and the diverse array of bioactive nutrients present in these natural products may play a pivotal role in prevention and one day, perhaps, even the cure of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Accumulated evidence suggests that naturally occurring plant compounds may potentially hinder neurodegeneration, and even improve memory and cognitive function, as I’ve shared in my videos Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease with Plants and How to Slow Brain Aging By Two Years), as well as treat Alzheimer’s with spices such as saffron or turmeric (See Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s and Treating Alzheimer’s with Turmeric). Vegetables may be particularly protective, in part because of certain compounds found in dark green leafy vegetables.  These compounds concentrate in the brain, and their consumption is associated with lower rates of age-related cognitive decline. Yet, when you look at systematic reviews on what we can do to prevent cognitive decline, you’ll see conclusions like this: “The current literature does not provide adequate evidence to make recommendations for interventions.” The same is said for Alzheimer’s, “Currently, insufficient evidence exists to draw firm conclusions on the association of any modifiable factors with risk of Alzheimer’s disease.” Doctors cite the lack of randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) as the basis for their conclusions. RCTs are the gold standard used to test new medicines. This is where researchers randomize people into two groups, half get the drug and half don’t, to control for confounding factors. The highest level of evidence is necessary because drugs may kill a hundred thousand Americans every year – not medication errors or illicit drugs, just regular, FDA-approved prescription drugs, making medication alone the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. So, you better make absolutely sure the benefits of new drugs outweigh the often life-threatening risks. But we’re talking about diet and exercise—the side effects are all good; so, we don’t need the same level of rigorous evidence to prescribe them. A “modest proposal” was published recently in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, an editorial calling for a longitudinal study of dementia prevention. They agreed that definitive evidence for the effectiveness of dementia prevention methods was lacking; so, we need large-scaled randomized trials. They suggested we start with 10,000 healthy volunteers in their 20’s and split them into five groups. There’s evidence, for example, that traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s, because people with head injuries appear more likely to get the disease, but it’s never been put to the test. So, they say, let’s take two thousand people and beat half of them in the head with baseball bats, and the other half we’ll use Styrofoam bats as a control. Afterall, until we have randomized controls, how can physicians recommend patients not get hit in the head? They go further saying we should probably chain a thousand people to a treadmill for 40 years, and a thousand people to a couch before recommending exercise. A thousand will be forced to do crossword puzzles; another thousand forced to watch Jerry Springer reruns, with lots of meat and dairy or not prescribed for another group for the next 40 years, and we can hook a thousand folks on four packs a day just to be sure. We help our patients to quit smoking despite the fact that there’s not a single randomized controlled trial where they held people down and piped smoke into their lungs for a few decades. It is time to realize that the ultimate study in regard to lifestyle and cognitive health cannot be done. Yet, the absence of definitive evidence should not restrict physicians from making reasonable recommendations based on the evidence that is available.

A-39	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/25/how-turmeric-can-help-combat-the-effects-of-sitting/	How Turmeric Can Help Combat the Effects of Sitting	The average American spends most of their waking life sitting down, which is associated with an increased risk of death even among people who go to the gym after work and exercise regularly. Doing lots of sitting may double our risk of diabetes and heart disease while significantly shortening our lifespan, even at the highest levels of physical activity. Sitting six or more hours a day may increase mortality rates even among those running or swimming an hour a day, every day, seven days a week. Why though?  I examine this in Turmeric Cucumin vs. Exercise for Artery Function. One factor may be endothelial dysfunction, the inability of the inner lining of our blood vessels to relax our arteries normally in response to blood flow. Just like our muscles atrophy if we don’t use them, when it comes to arterial function, it’s “use it or lose it” as well. Increased blood flow promotes a healthy endothelium. The cells lining our arteries can actually sense the sheer force of the blood flowing past. That flow is what maintains the stability and integrity of the inner lining of our arteries. Without that constant tugging flow, it may help set us up for heart disease. We actually have some data now suggesting that treadmill desks may improve the health of office workers without affecting work performance, and walking may be preferable to standing in terms of clearing fat from our bloodstream, which can play a role in endothelial dysfunction. What if our office can’t accommodate a standing or walking desk? Within an hour of sitting, blood starts pooling and blood flow starts to stagnate; so, the more we can take breaks, the better. Preliminary evidence from observational and interventional studies suggests that regular interruptions in sitting time can be beneficial. And it doesn’t have to be long. Breaks could be as short as one minute and not necessarily entail exercise, just something like taking out the trash during commercials may be beneficial. I’ve talked about the effects of different diets on endothelial function (See Eggs and Arterial Function, Walnuts and Arterial Function, Vinegar and Artery Function, and Dark Chocolate and Artery Function) and how certain foods in particular—nuts and green tea—are beneficial for endothelial health. Recently, researchers tried out curcumin, the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric. They showed that regular ingestion of curcumin or up to an hour a day of aerobic exercise training significantly improved endothelial function. And the magnitude of improvement in endothelial function was the same. So, does that mean we can just be a couch potato as long as we eat curried potatoes? No, the combination of curcumin and exercise appears to work even better than either alone. I’m on my third treadmill desk motor, after burning out two. The 2nd one lasted 7,000 miles, though. Could have walked back and forth across the country! I do about 17 miles a day. More on treadmill desks in Standing Up for Your Health. Amazing how much beneficial just simple walking can be: Longer Life Within Walking Distance More exercise versus diet comparisons in Is it the Diet, the Exercise, or Both? and How Much Exercise to Sustain Weight Loss.

A-40	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/20/can-peppermint-improve-athletic-performance/	Can Peppermint Improve Athletic Performance?	  Ever since smoking was prohibited in night clubs, customers have increasingly noticed other unpleasant smells present in the club—like body odors. So, researchers in Europe thought they’d try to cover them up. The researchers measured the effects of peppermint, for example, on dancing activity and asked people to rate their energy level. They found that with peppermint scent, people felt more cheerful and danced more, and so, concluded the researchers, “environmental fragrancing may be expected to have a positive effects on club revenue.” Innovative nightclubs are already inviting “aroma jockeys” to smell the places up. The business community caught whiff of this and thought maybe peppermint smell would get their secretaries to type faster. And it worked! There was improved performance on clerical tasks associated with the administration of peppermint odor. In an age where athletic competitions are frequently won or lost by mere hundredths of a second, athletes are continually looking for new ways to excel in their sport. Researchers threw some collegiate athletes onto a treadmill and piped different smell into their nostrils, and those on peppermint reported feeling less fatigued, more vigorous, less frustrated, and felt they performed better. But did they actually perform better?  See my video, Enhancing Athletic Performance with Peppermint. A different study published in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology measured actual performance, and participants were actually able to squeeze out one extra pushup before collapsing and cut almost two seconds off a quarter mile dash with an odorized adhesive strip stuck to their upper lip. Interestingly there was no significant difference in basketball free throws. The researchers think the reason is that free throws actually require some skill, and all the peppermint can do is really improve athletes’ motivation. Unfortunately, follow-up studies were not able to replicate these results, showing no beneficial effect of smelling peppermint on athletic performance; so, how about eating peppermint? Researchers measured the effects of peppermint on exercise performance before and after ten days of having subjects drink bottles of water with a single drop of peppermint essential oil in them. And all the subjects’ performance parameters shot up, churning out 50 percent more work, 20 percent more power, and a 25 percent greater time to exhaustion. Improvements were found across the board in all those physiological parameters, indicating increased respiratory efficiency. They attribute these remarkable results to the peppermint opening up their airways, increasing ventilation and oxygen delivery. Now, you can overdose on the stuff, but a few drops shouldn’t be toxic. Why not get the best of both worlds by blending fresh mint leaves in water rather than use the oil? Sometimes aromatherapy alone may actually help, though: Beet juice can also enhance athletic performance. See the dozen or so videos in the series starting with Doping With Beet Juice. Other ways healthy food can synergize with exercise: I use peppermint in my Pink Juice with Green Foam recipe and talk about using the dried in Antioxidants in a Pinch. It can also help reduce IBS symptoms, as seen in Peppermint Oil for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

A-41	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/18/reversal-of-chronic-disease-risk-even-late-in-life/	Reversal of Chronic Disease Risk Even Late in Life	A hundred years ago, the New York Times reported on a rather sophisticated study for the time: 4,600 cases of cancer appearing over a seven year period, suggesting that the increased consumption of animal foods was to blame. A century later, the latest review on the subjects concluded that mortality from all causes put together, ischemic heart disease, circulatory, and cerebrovascular diseases was significantly lower in those eating meat-free diets, in addition to less cancer and diabetes.  I’m surprised they found such significant results given that people in these studies typically didn’t stop eating meat until late in life. For example, in the largest study done up until recently, up to a third of subjects ate vegetarian for less than five years, yet they still ended up with lower rates of heart disease whether they were under 60 or over 60, normal weight or overweight, used to smoke or never smoked; those that had stopped eating meat had lower risk, suggesting that decades of higher risk dietary behavior could be reversed within just years of eating healthier. If you look at countries that switched from eating traditional, more plant-based diets to more Westernized diets, it may take 20 years for cancer rates to shoot up. It takes decades for most tumors to grow. For example, if you look at Asia, their dietary shift was accompanied by a remarkable increase in mortality rates of breast, colon, and prostate cancers. The same thing can be shown with migration studies. Men moving from rural China to the U.S. experience a dramatic increase in cancer risk, but tumors take time to grow. So it’s remarkable to me that after most of a lifetime eating the standard Western diet, one can turn it around and reverse chronic disease risk with a healthier diet, even late in the game… as discussed in my video, Never Too Late to Start Eating Healthier. So, “should we all start eating vegetarian?” asked an editorial that accompanied the results from the largest study ever published on Americans eating plant-based diets, which found vegetarian diets to be associated with lower all-cause mortality, meaning those who started eating vegetarian live, on average, longer lives. This analysis included so-called semi-vegetarians, who ate meat at least once a month (but no more than once a week), so it’s not yet clear how harmful eating meat a few times a month is. What we can all agree on, though, is that we should limit our intake of junk food and animal fat, and eat more fruits and vegetables. Most authorities will also agree that diets should include whole grains, beans, and nuts. Instead of fighting over whose diet is the best, it’s time to acknowledge these common features of diets associated with less disease, and instead focus our attention on helping patients avoid the intense commercial pressures to eat otherwise. How amazing the human body is if we just treat it right! For more on lifestyle medicine, see:  So please don’t allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Any movement we can make towards improving our diet can help. Though the earlier the better: See Heart Disease Starts in Childhood and Back in Circulation: Sciatica and Cholesterol.

A-42	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/13/are-raisins-a-good-snack-choice/	Are Raisins a Good Snack Choice?	Raisins, like all fruits, have a variety of health benefits, but dried fruit is higher in calories per serving than fresh; so, might they contribute to weight gain? A study done by the University of Connecticut helped set people’s minds at ease. Men and women were assigned to consume a cup of raisins a day for six weeks and were able to successfully offset the consumption of other foods in their diets such that they experienced no significant change in weight or waist circumference. What about in kids? I explore that in the video, Are Raisins Good Snacks for Kids?.  Leave it to the California Raisin Marketing Board to dream up a study titled, “An after-school snack of raisins lowers cumulative food intake in young children.” Sounds good, right? They compared raisins to potato chips and chocolate chip cookies. They gave kids raisins, grapes, chips or cookies and said they could eat as much as they wanted and surprise, surprise kids ate less fruit and more junk, but I guess naming the paper “Kids Prefer Cookies” would not have garnered the same kind of sponsor approval. This reminds me of another study they did showing that regular consumption of raisins may reduce blood sugar levels… compared to fudge cookies and Oreos. Another study  showed raisins caused less of a blood sugar spike than Coca-Cola and candy bars. Though you can tell it was not funded by Big Raisin by their conclusion, “whether the general public should be advised to snack on fruit rather than on candy bars requires further debate and investigation.” Comparing raisins to chips and cookies was similarly unhelpful. Luckily, a less biased study was published by researchers at the University of Toronto. Nine to eleven year old boys and girls were told to eat all the grapes or raisins they wanted 30 minutes before a meal in which they could eat all the pizza they wanted. If you just gave them the meal, no snack, they ate 837 calories worth of pizza. If you gave them all-you-can-eat grapes before the meal, they ate 128 calories of grapes, but that seemed to fill them up a bit; so, they ended up eating less pizza. But because they ate the snack and the meal, they ended up getting more calories over all. Still, grape calories are better than pizza calories, but when given raisins instead, they ate even more snack calories, but the raisins were evidently so satiating that they ate so much less pizza that they ate fewer calories over all. Now, I know as parents, there’s a concern that if our kids eat snacks it might spoil their dinner, but when the snacks are fruit and the meal is a pepperoni and three cheese pizza, the more we can ruin their appetite, the better. Raisin marketers aren’t the only ones trying to game the scientific method.

A-43	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/11/what-about-eating-just-a-little-meat/	What About Eating Just a Little Meat?	As you can see in my video, Plant-Based Diets and Diabetes, we’ve known for decades that a plant-based diet may be protective against diabetes. Studies going back half a century found that those eating meat one or more days a week had significantly higher rates of diabetes, and the more frequently meat was eaten, the more frequent the disease. And this is after controlling for weight; so, even at the same weight, those eating more plant-based had but a fraction of the diabetes rates. If anything, vegetarians should have had more diabetes just because they appear to live so much longer; so, they had more time to develop these kinds of chronic diseases; but no, apparently lower rates of death and disease. Fast forward 50 years to the Adventist-2 study, looking at 89,000 people, and we see a stepwise drop in the rates of diabetes as one ate more and more plant-based, down to a 78% lower prevalence among those eating strictly plant-based. Protection building incrementally as one moved from eating meat daily, to eating meat weekly, to just fish, to no meat, and then to no eggs and dairy either. Followed over time, vegetarian diets were associated with a substantially lower incidence of diabetes, indicating the potential of these diets to stem the current diabetes epidemic. We see the same step-wise drop in rates of another leading killer, high blood pressure. The greater the proportion of plant foods, the lower the rates of hypertension, and the same with excess body fat. The only dietary group not on average overweight were those eating diets composed exclusively of plant foods, but again there was the same incremental drop with fewer and fewer animal products. This suggests that it’s not black and white, not all or nothing; any steps we can make along this spectrum of eating healthier may accrue significant benefits. What about eating a really healthy diet with just a little meat? Is it better to eat none at all? We had new insight last year from Taiwan. Asian diets in general tend to be lower in meat and higher in plant foods compared with Western diet, but whether a diet completely avoiding meat and fish would further extend the protective effect of a plant-based diet wasn’t known, until now. Traditionally, Asian populations have had low rates of diabetes, but a diabetes epidemic has since emerged, and appears to coincide with increased meat, animal protein, and animal fat consumption, but the Westernization of Asian diets also brought along a lot of fast food and junk; and so, these researchers at the national university didn’t want to just compare those eating vegetarian to typical meat eaters. So, they compared Buddhist vegetarians to Buddhist non-vegetarians, eating traditional Asian diets. Even the omnivores were eating a predominantly plant-based diet, consuming little meat and fish, with the women eating the equivalent of about a single serving a week, and men eating a serving every few days. That’s just 8% of the meat intake in the U.S., 3% for the women. The question: is it better to eat 3% or 0%? Again, both groups were eating healthy: zero soda consumption, for example, in any group. Despite the similarities in their diet, and after controlling for weight, family history, exercise, and smoking, the men eating vegetarian had just half the rates of diabetes, and the vegetarian women just a quarter of the rates. So, even in a population consuming a really plant-based diet with little meat and fish, true vegetarians who completely avoided animal flesh, while eating more healthy plant foods, have lower odds for prediabetes and diabetes after accounting for other risk factors. They wanted to break it up into vegan versus ovo-lacto like in the Adventist-2 study, but they couldn’t because there were no cases at all of diabetes found within the vegan group.  More on preventing and treating this terrible disease: The reason I keep going back to that Adventist-2 study is that it’s not only the biggest study of those eating plant based diets in North America, but the largest such study anywhere anytime. We owe those investigators a great debt (not to mention the 96,741 participants!). One thing I’m happy my tax dollars are going towards (via the National Cancer Institute and National Institutes of Health).

A-44	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/06/do-you-meet-the-simple-seven/	Do You Meet the Simple Seven?	In public health school, you learn there are three levels of preventive medicine. Primary prevention would be like trying to prevent someone at risk for heart disease from getting his or her first heart attack. Secondary prevention is when you already have the disease and are trying to prevent your second heart attack, and tertiary prevention is like cardiac rehab, where you’re just trying to reduce the complication rates. A fourth level was suggested in 2000, quaternary prevention, trying to reduce the damage from all the drugs and surgery from the first three levels. But people seem to forget about a fifth concept, introduced by the World Health Organization back in 1978, termed primordial prevention, which is being embraced by the American Heart Association’s 2020 strategic impact goals.  Primordial prevention was conceived as a strategy to prevent whole societies from experiencing epidemics of the risk factors. The corresponding strategy at the individual level is to prevent the development of risk factors. Instead of trying to prevent someone with high cholesterol from getting a heart attack, why not prevent them from getting high cholesterol in the first place? So, the American Heart Association came up with the simple seven, featured in my video, How Many Meet the Simple Seven?. These health behaviors or factors include not smoking, not being overweight, being “very active” (defined as walking at least 22 minutes a day), eating a few fruits and veggies, having below average cholesterol, normal blood pressure, and normal blood sugars.  Their goal was to reduce heart disease deaths by 20% by 2020. Why so modest an aim? An improvement of 25% was deemed “unrealistic,” and 15% was considered insufficient; so, they decided on 20. If 90% of risk can be thrown out the window by engaging in simple lifestyle modifications, why is just 25% considered unrealistic? To understand, one must realize just how bad our diets have gotten. The most common reason patients give for not complying with a cholesterol-lowering diet may be the presumption that they’re already eating healthy and so don’t need to change. But if you look at the status of cardiovascular health in U.S. adults, only about 1% of Americans have a bare minimum of healthy eating behaviors, such as five-a-day fruits and veggies, eating beans, whole grains, and drinking less than three cans of soda a week. What percentage of Americans hit all seven of the simple seven? 14,000 men and women were surveyed, and most had two or three, but hardly any had all seven simple health components. Just how low a prevalence was having seven out of seven? Only about 1 out of 2,000 Americans had all seven factors intact. And the one they were missing the most was diet. Unfortunately, unhealthy behaviors extend into the medical profession. Just like smoking doctors are less likely to tell their patients to stop smoking, and couch potato docs are less likely to push exercise, or things like more fruits and vegetables; we need to role-model healthy behavior. This greatly enhances our credibility and effectiveness. Gone are the days of traditional authority when the fat physician, dropping cigarette ash down his gravy-stained vest, could credibly prescribe a change in behavior. So What Diet Should Physicians Recommend? Watch the video! Lifestyle medicine, the use of diet and lifestyle changes to prevent and treat disease, can be not only cheaper and safer, but also more effective.

A-45	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/10/04/how-to-design-saturated-fat-studies-to-hide-the-truth/	How to Design Saturated Fat Studies to Hide the Truth	Where do the international consensus guidelines to dramatically lower saturated fat consumption come from? (I show the list in my video, The Saturated Fat Studies: Buttering Up the Public). They came from literally hundreds of metabolic ward experiments, which means you don’t just ask people to change their diets, you essentially lock them in a room—for weeks if necessary—and have total control over their diet. You can then experimentally change the level of saturated fat consumed by subjects however you want to, and see the corresponding change in their cholesterol levels. And the results are so consistent that you can create an equation, the famous Hegsted Equation, where you can predict how much their cholesterol will go up based on how much saturated fat you give them. So, if you want your LDL cholesterol to go up 50 points, all you have to do is eat something like 30% of your calories in saturated fat. When you plug the numbers in, the change in cholesterol shoots up as predicted. The experiments match the predictions. You can do it at home with one of those home cholesterol testing kits, eat a stick of butter every day, and watch your cholesterol climb. These ward experiments were done in 1965; meaning we’ve known for 50 years that even if you keep calorie intake the same, increases in saturated fat intake are associated with highly significant increases in LDL bad cholesterol. Your good cholesterol goes up a bit too, but that increase is smaller than the increase in bad, which would translate into increased heart disease risk. So, if you feed vegetarians meat even just once a day, their cholesterol jumps nearly 20% within a month. To prevent heart disease, we need a total cholesterol under 150, which these vegetarians were, but then even just eating meat once a day, and their cholesterol shot up 19%. The good news is that within just two weeks of returning to their meat-free diet, their cholesterol dropped back down into the safe range. Note that their HDL good cholesterol hardly moved at all; so, their ratio went from low risk of heart attack to high risk in a matter of weeks with just one meat-containing meal a day. And indeed, randomized clinical trials show that dietary saturated fat reduction doesn’t just appear to reduce cholesterol levels, but also reduces the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events like heart attacks. So, we have randomized clinical trials, controlled interventional experiments—our most robust forms of evidence—no wonder there’s a scientific consensus to decrease saturated fat intake! You’ll note, though, that the Y-axis in these studies seen in my video The Saturated Fat Studies: Set Up to Fail is not cholesterol, but change in cholesterol. That’s because everyone’s set-point is different. Two people eating the same diet with the same amount of saturated fat can have very different cholesterol levels. One person can eat ten chicken nuggets a day and have an LDL cholesterol of 90; another person eating ten a day could start out with an LDL of 120. It depends on your genes. But while our genetics may be different, our biology is the same, meaning the rise and drop in cholesterol is the same for everyone. So, if both folks cut out the nuggets, the 90 might drop to 85, whereas the 120 would drop to 115. Wherever we start, we can lower our cholesterol by eating less saturated fat, but if I just know your saturated fat intake—how many nuggets you eat, I can’t tell you what your starting cholesterol is. All I can say with certainty is that if you eat less, your cholesterol will likely improve. But because of this extreme “interindividual variation”—this wide variability in baseline cholesterol levels for any given saturated fat intake—if you take a cross-section of the population, you can find no statistical correlation between saturated fat intake and cholesterol levels, because it’s not like everyone who eats a certain set amount of saturated fat is going to have over a certain cholesterol. So, there are three ways you could study diet and cholesterol levels: controlled feeding experiments, free-living dietary change experiments, or cross-sectional observations of large populations. As we know, there is a clear and strong relationship between change in diet and change in serum cholesterol in the interventional designs, but because of that individual variability, in cross-sectional designs, you can get zero correlation. In fact, if you do the math, that’s what you’d expect you’d get. In statistical parlance, one would say that a cross-sectional study doesn’t have the power for detecting such a relationship. Thus, because of that variability, these kinds of observational studies would seem an inappropriate method to study this particular relationship. So, since diet and serum cholesterol have a zero correlation cross-sectionally, an observational study of the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease incidence will suffer from the same difficulties. So again, if you do the math, observational studies would unavoidably show nearly no correlation between saturated fat and heart disease. These prospective studies can be valuable for other diseases, but the appropriate design demonstrating or refuting the role of diet and coronary heart disease is a dietary change experiment. And those dietary change experiments have been done; they implicate saturated fat, hence the lower saturated guidelines from basically every major medical authority. In fact, if we lower saturated fat enough, we may be able to reverse heart disease, opening up arteries without drugs or surgery. So, with this knowledge, how would the meat and dairy industry prove otherwise? They use the observational studies that mathematically would be unable to show any correlation. All they need now is a friendly researcher, such as Ronald M. Krauss, who has been funded by the National Dairy Council since 1989, also the National Cattleman’s Beef Association, as well as the Atkins Foundation. Then, they just combine all the observational studies that don’t have the power to provide significant evidence, and not surprisingly, as published in their 2010 meta-analysis, no significant evidence was found. The 2010 meta-analysis was basically just repackaged for 2014, using the same and similar studies. As the Chair of Harvard’s nutrition department put it, their conclusions regarding the type of fat being unimportant are seriously misleading and should be disregarded, going as far as suggesting the paper be retracted, even after the authors corrected a half dozen different errors. It’s not as though they falsified or fabricated data—they didn’t have to. They knew beforehand the limitations of observational studies, they knew they’d get the “right” result and so they published it, helping to “neutralize the negative impact of milk and meat fat by regulators and medical professionals.” And it’s working, according to the dairy industry, as perceptions about saturated fat in the scientific community are changing. They even go so far to say this is a welcome message to consumers, who may be tired of hearing what they shouldn’t eat. They don’t need to convince consumers, just confuse them. Confusion can easily be misused by the food industry to promote their interests. It’s like that infamous tobacco industry memo that read, “Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the “body of fact” that exists in the mind of the general public.” They don’t have to convince the public that smoking is healthy to get people to keep consuming their products. They just need to establish a controversy. Conflicting messages in nutrition cause people to become so frustrated and confused they may just throw their hands up in the air and eat whatever is put in front of them, which is exactly what saturated fat suppliers want, but at what cost to the public’s health? If that “Doubt is our product” memo sounded familiar, I also featured it in my Food Industry Funded Research Bias video.

A-46	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/29/butter-is-back/	Butter is Back?	Time magazine’s cover exhorting people to eat butter could be viewed as a desperate attempt to revive dwindling print sales, but they claimed to be reporting on real science—a systematic review and meta-analysis published in a prestigious journal that concluded that current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage cutting down on saturated fat, like the kind found in meat and dairy products like butter. No wonder it got so much press, since reducing saturated fat intake is a major focus of most dietary recommendations worldwide, aiming to prevent chronic diseases including coronary heart disease. So, to quote the Center for Science in the Public Interest, “What gives? Evidently, shaky science…and a mission by the global dairy industry to boost sales.” They interviewed an academic insider, who noted that some researchers are intent on showing saturated fat does not cause heart disease, which can be seen in my video The Saturated Fat Studies: Buttering Up the Public. In 2008, the global dairy industry held a meeting where they decided that one of their main priorities was to “neutralize the negative impact of milk fat by regulators and medical professionals.” So, they set up a major, well-funded campaign to come up with proof that saturated fat does not cause heart disease. They assembled scientists who were sympathetic to the dairy industry, provided them with funding, encouraged them to put out statements on milk fat and heart disease, and arranged to have them speak at scientific meetings. And the scientific publications we’ve seen emerging since the Mexico meeting have done just what they set out to do. During this meeting, the dairy industry discussed what is the key barrier to increasing worldwide demand for dairy. There’s global warming issues and other milks competing out there, but number one on the list is the “Negative messages and intense pressure to reduce saturated fats by governments and non-governmental organizations.” In short, the negative messages are outweighing the positive; so indeed, their number one priority is to neutralize the negative image of milk fat among regulators and health professionals as related to heart disease. So, if we are the dairy industry, how are we going to do it? Imagine you work for Big Butter. You’ve got quite the challenge ahead of you. If you look at recommendations from around the globe, there is a global scientific consensus to limit saturated fat intake with most authoritative bodies recommending getting saturated fat at least under 10% of calories, with the prestigious U.S. Institute of Medicine and the European Food Safety Authority recommending to push saturated fat consumption down as low as possible. The latest guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend reducing trans fat intake, giving it their strongest A-grade level of evidence. And they say the same same for reducing saturated fat intake. Since saturated and trans fats are found in the same place, meat and dairy, cutting down on foods with saturated fat will have the additional benefit of lowering trans fat intake. They recommend pushing saturated fat intake down to 5 or 6%. People don’t realize how small that is. One KFC chicken breast could take us over the top. Or, two pats of butter and two cubes of cheese and we’re done for the day—no more dairy, meat, or eggs. That’d be about 200 calories; so, they are in effect saying 90% of our diet should be free of saturated fat-containing foods. That’s like the American Heart Association saying, “Two meals a week can be packed with meat, dairy, and junk, but the entire rest of the week should be unprocessed plant-foods.” That’s how stringent the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommendations are. So, this poses a problem for Big Cheese and Chicken. The top contributors of cholesterol-raising saturated fat are cheese, ice cream, chicken, non-ice cream desserts like cake and pie, and then pork. So, what are these industries to do? See The Saturated Fat Studies: Set Up to Fail. For those unfamiliar with Trans Fat in Meat and Dairy (and refined vegetable oils), I made a video about it! The U.S. National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine “as low as possible” position, echoed by the European Food Safety Authority, is described in my video: Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. What happened when a country tried to put the lower saturated fat guidance into practice? See the remarkable results in Dietary Guidelines: From Dairies to Berries. Don’t think the dietary guidelines process could be undermined by underhanded corporate tactics?

A-47	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/27/dietary-factors-affect-breast-cancer/	How to Cut Breast Cancer Risk in Half	One of my favorite cancer-specific charities, the American Institute for Cancer Research, lauds the China Study and the documentary Forks Over Knives, with which they share the same bottom-line message: The healthiest diets are those that revolve around whole plant foods. They then translate that advice into their Ten Recommendations for Cancer Prevention, featured in my video Which Dietary Factors Affect Breast Cancer Most? We now have evidence that those who follow such advice are actually protected against cancer. Breast cancer risk was reduced by 60% in women who met at least five recommendations compared with those who met none. The most important dietary advice was to be as lean as possible within the normal range of body weight, eat mostly foods of plant origin, and limit alcoholic drinks. What about other cancers? Greater adherence to the AICR dietary guidelines was also associated with significantly less endometrial, colorectal, lung, kidney, stomach, oral, liver, and esophageal cancer. In other words, adherence to dietary recommendations for cancer prevention may lower the risk of developing most types of cancer. The drop in bladder cancer did not reach statistical significance, but a larger follow-up study following 469,000 people for 11 years (the largest to date) found that just a 3% increase in the consumption of animal protein calories was associated with a 15% higher risk of bladder cancer, whereas just a 2% increase in plant protein was associated with a 23% lower risk. AICR recommendation number ten is that cancer survivors should follow the recommendations for cancer prevention. The same diet that can help prevent cancer in the first place can be used to help save our life after diagnosis. Adherence to the guidelines for cancer prevention was found to be associated with lower mortality among older female cancer survivors for breast cancer and other cancers in general. A cancer diagnosis is considered a teachable moment to get people eating and living healthier. Oncologists revel at the growth in the number of cancer survivors in this country, now ten million strong and growing. It’s great that those with cancer are living longer, but even better to prevent it in the first place so we can all live longer. Not only does adherence to the guidelines lower cancer risk, but it also extends our lifespan because the guidelines are also significantly associated with a lower hazard of dying from heart disease and respiratory disease, suggesting that following the recommendations could “significantly increase longevity.” Just like eating to prevent cancer helps to prevent heart disease, eating to protect our heart helps prevent cancer. It sounds self-evident, but adherence to a healthy lifestyle is therefore associated with a lower risk of mortality overall. And the more healthy behaviors we have, the longer we get to live. Such factors include not smoking, walking every day, or eating green leafy vegetables almost daily. To help differentiate the effects of diet from other lifestyle behaviors, like smoking and drinking, on cancer incidence, Adventists were recently compared to Baptists. Both discourage alcohol and tobacco, but the Adventists go further, encouraging a reduction of meat. In general, the Adventists had lower cancer hazard rates than the Baptists, and within Adventist populations, the vegetarians did even better, and those eating the most plants did the best. Why do plant-based diets appear to lower the risk of cancer?

A-48	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/22/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-and-fish-food-poisoning/	Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & Fish Food Poisoning	Ciguatera is one of the most common forms of food poisoning, which occurs after the consumption of fish contaminated with neurotoxins produced by certain microalgae that build up the food chain. Just a few bites can be sufficient to induce the condition. Disturbingly, affected fish looks, smells, and tastes normal, and ciguatoxins are resistant to all forms of cooking. So, there is no straightforward method to predict whether a seafood meal can turn into a ciguatera nightmare. It literally can cause nightmares; about one in six may experience signs of hallucinatory poisoning: lack of coordination, hallucinations, depression, and nightmares. Most suffer some kind of neurological symptoms, such as tingling, numbness, and a burning cold sensation. Sometimes, a reversal of temperature sensation occurs, where cold objects feel hot and vice versa. For instance, ciguatera sufferers have reported that a refreshing dive in the ocean actually caused burning pain, or that drinking cool beer felt like too hot coffee. The toxin may also be apparently sexually transmitted, or as one of my favorite public health bloggers put it, “when hot sex turns cold and painful, blame it on dinner.” As seen in my video Ciguatera Poisoning & Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, the symptoms can persist for months or even years. Ongoing research has shown that people with chronic fatigue syndrome may actually be suffering the long-term effects of this fish food poisoning or a condition called polymyositis, which causes diffuse muscle aches, pains, and inflammation. Some individuals intoxicated by fish consumption 25 years previously experience a recurrence of the main neurological disturbances during periods of overwork, fatigue, or stress. You can still find the toxins stuck in your body decades later. Recent outbreaks in New York City have drawn attention to the problem. For example, a man ate grouper at a Manhattan restaurant and went from swimming two miles a day to having difficulty walking that lasted for months. But these aren’t just rare anecdotes. Ciguatera fish poisoning affects an estimated 15,000 Americans every year, causing hundreds of hospitalizations and even a few deaths. Because the toxins are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and not destroyed by cooking, CDC scientists suggest “education aimed at the prevention of seafood intoxication by avoidance of high-risk fish altogether.” The AMA put out a similar advisory, suggesting that the only way to prevent it is to avoid eating fish like red snapper or grouper, but the problem is that a third of fish sold in the United States is mislabeled; so, we don’t know what we’re getting. Some suggest first feeding a portion of the fish meal to a cat, treating them like a court tester, and if they’re okay six hours later, we can dig in — but this was considered inhumane. But if it’s inhumane to feed it to your cat, how is it not inhumane to feed it to other members of the family?

A-49	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/20/food-additives-that-may-make-our-gut-leaky/	Food Additives That May Make our Gut Leaky	Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects more than a million Americans. It is an inflammatory bowel disease in which the body attacks the intestines. There is currently no known cure for Crohn’s disease; current research focuses on controlling symptoms. There is no definitive medical or surgical therapy. The best we have is a plant-based diet, which has afforded the best relapse prevention to date. Researchers got the idea to try a plant-based diet because diets rich in animal protein and animal fat have been found to cause a decrease in beneficial bacteria in the intestine. So, researchers designed a semi-vegetarian diet to counter that, and 100 percent of subjects stayed in remission the first year and 92 percent the second year. These results are far better than those obtained by current drugs, including new “biological agents” that can cost $40,000 a year, and can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a disabling and deadly brain disease. And a healthier diet appears to work better. But what about preventing Crohn’s disease in the first place? A systematic review of the scientific literature on dietary intake and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease found that a high intake of fats and meat was associated with an increased risk of Crohn’s disease as well as ulcerative colitis, whereas high fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased risk of Crohn’s. These results were supported more recently by the Harvard Nurse’s Health Study. Data revealed that long-term intake of dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, was associated with lower risk of Crohn’s disease. Women who fell into the highest long-term fiber consumption group had a 40 percent reduced risk, leading the accompanying editorial to conclude, “advocating for a high-fiber diet may ultimately reduce the incidence of Crohn’s disease.”  The irony is that the highest fiber group wasn’t even eating the official recommended daily minimum of fiber intake. Apparently, even just being less fiber deficient has a wide range of benefits, including a significant reduction in the risk of developing Crohn’s disease, but why? The authors suggest it’s because “fiber plays a vital role in the maintenance of our intestinal barrier function.” Our skin keeps the outside world outside, and so does the lining of our gut, but in Crohn’s disease, this barrier function is impaired. You can see this under an electron microscope as shown in my video Preventing Crohn’s Disease With Diet. The tight junctions between the intestinal cells have all sorts of little holes and breaks. The thought is that the increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases may be due to dietary changes which lead to the breakdown of our intestinal barrier, potentially allowing the penetration of bacteria into our gut wall, which our body then attacks, triggering the inflammation. We know fiber acts as a prebiotic in our colon (large intestine), feeding our good bacteria, but what does fiber do in our small intestine where Crohn’s often starts? We didn’t know, until a landmark study was published. Researchers wanted to find out what could stop Crohn’s associated invasive bacteria from tunneling into the gut wall. They found the invasion is inhibited by the presence of certain soluble plant fibers, such as from plantains and broccoli at the kinds of concentrations one might expect after eating them. They wondered if that may explain why plantain-loving populations have lower levels of inflammatory bowel disease. But, the researchers also found that there was something in processed foods that facilitated the invasion of the bacteria. Polysorbate 80 was one of them, found predominantly in ice cream, but also found in Crisco, Cool Whip, condiments, cottage cheese—you just have to read the labels. What about maltodextrin, which is found in artificial sweeteners like Splenda, snack foods, salad dressings, and fiber supplements? Maltodextrin markedly enhanced the ability of the bacteria to glob onto our intestinal cells, though other additives, carboxy-methyl cellulose and xanthan gum appeared to have no adverse effects. This may all help solve the mystery of the increasing prevalence of Crohn’s disease in developed nations, where we’re eating less fiber-containing whole plant foods and more processed foods. What we need now are interventional studies to see if boosting fiber intake and avoiding these food additives can be effective in preventing and treating Crohn’s disease. But until then, what do we tell people? The available evidence points to a diet low in animal fat, with lots of soluble fiber containing plant foods, and avoiding processed fatty foods that contain these emulsifiers. We also want to make sure we’re not ingesting traces of dishwashing detergent, which could have the same effect; so, make sure to rinse your dishes well. Researchers found that some people wash dishes and then just leave them to dry without rinsing, which is probably not a good idea. We don’t currently have studies that show that avoiding polysorbate 80 and rinsing dishes well actually helps. Nevertheless, advice based on ‘best available evidence’ is better than no advice at all. Here’s a video about using a more plant-based diet to reduce the risk of relapses: Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease. I get a lot of questions about additives like polysorbate 80. I’m glad I was finally able to do a blog about it. Here are some videos on some others: If you, like me, used to think all fiber was good for was helping with bowel regularity you’ll be amazed!

A-50	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/15/pregnant-women-avoid-cows-milk/	Should Pregnant Women Avoid Cow’s Milk?	Foods of animal origin in general naturally contain hormones, but cow’s milk may be of particular concern. The hormones naturally found even in organic cow’s milk may have played a role in studies that found a relationship between dairy products and human illnesses, such as acne, certain cancers, and male reproductive disorders. Milk consumption has also been associated with an increased risk of early puberty in girls and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women, but “hormonal levels in food could be particularly dangerous in the case of vulnerable populations, such as young children or pregnant women. To these critical populations, even a small hormonal intake could lead to major changes in the metabolism.” If you check out my video Why Do Vegan Women Have 5x Fewer Twins, you can see that children are highly sensitive to sex steroids. Because their levels of sex steroids are very low, even a small variation would account for a major change in the total activity of the involved hormone. Because no lower threshold for estrogenic action has been established, caution should be taken to avoid unnecessary exposure of fetuses and children to exogenous sex steroids, even at very low levels. In the AMA’s Pediatrics Journal, the chair of Boston Children’s Hospital’s Obesity Prevention Center along with the chair of Harvard’s nutrition department questioned dairy industry recommendations that children should drink three glasses of milk a day. Dairy milk evolved to promote the growth of grazing animals at high risk for predation when small; so, they needed to put on a few hundred pounds quickly in the first few months of life. The consequences of lifetime human exposure to such growth factors in milk have not been well studied. They wrote: “Milk consumption increases serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is linked to prostate and other cancers. In addition, modern industrial methods maintain dairy cows in active milk production throughout their pregnancies, resulting in a milk supply with high levels of reproductive hormones.” Pregnant cows excrete significantly higher levels of sex steroids into their milk than non-pregnant cows. The subsequent consumption of such dairy products from pregnancy results in additional consumer exposure. And it’s not just dairy. Although dairy products are an important source of hormones, other products of animal origin must be considered as well. All edible tissues of animal origin contain estrogen. This may explain why, in a study of over a thousand women eating plant-based diets, vegan women have a twinning rate that is one fifth that of vegetarians and omnivores. Twin pregnancies are risky pregnancies, with much higher complication rates. Many parents and physicians underestimate the negative consequences of multiple pregnancy, but women with a multiple pregnancy face greater risks for themselves and their infants. Twin babies may be ten times more likely to die at birth. To avoid these complications, the research team writes, “women attempting conception should avoid milk and dairy products.” Minimizing dairy, our nation’s #1 source of saturated fat, may be a good idea for dads too: Dairy Estrogen and Male Fertility. What about the endocrine-disrupting xenoestrogens–how do they compare with the natural hormones in our food supply? That was the topic of my video Estrogen in Meat, Dairy, and Eggs.

A-51	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/13/estrogen-animal-products/	Estrogen in Animal Products	Estrogen hormones can be thousands of times more estrogenic than typical endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Dietary exposure to natural sex steroids (in meat, dairy, and eggs) is “therefore highly relevant in the discussion of the impact of estrogens on human development and health.” And chicken estrogen is identical to human estrogen—they’re the same molecule. So, it doesn’t matter if it ends up in our drinking supply from women taking birth control pills excreting it in their urine, or cows excreting it into their milk. The source doesn’t matter; the quantity does. If you check out my video Estrogen in Meat, Dairy, and Eggs, you can see that a child’s exposure to estrogens in drinking water is about 150 times lower than exposure from cow’s milk; so, our day-to-day estrogen exposure levels are more likely determined by whether or not we happen to eat dairy products that day. Human urine is “often cited as the main source of natural and synthetic estrogens in the aquatic environment,” but the level of estrogen even in the urine of heavy meat-eaters, who have significantly higher levels, pales in comparison to the estrogen excreted by the farm animals themselves. Pigs, sheep, cattle, and chickens produce literally tons of estrogen every year. Women may excrete 16 mg every day, but farm animals may release ten times more, or in the case of pregnant cows, thousands of times more. Animal waste may contribute an estimated 90% of total estrogens in the environment. Five gallons of runoff water contaminated with chicken manure may contain a birth control pill’s worth of estrogen. Estrogen levels in poultry litter are so high that when farmers feed chicken manure to their animals to save on feed costs, it may trigger premature development. Poultry manure has among the highest hormone content, quadruple the total estrogens, and nine times more 17-beta estradiol, the most potent estrogen and a “complete” carcinogen, as it exerts both tumor initiating and tumor promoting effects. From a human health standpoint, do we really care about feminized fish, or the appearance of “intersex roaches”? The problem is that the hormones get into the food supply. Endogenous steroid hormones in food of animal origin are unavoidable as they occur naturally in these products. It’s not a matter of injected hormones, which are banned in places like Europe in order to protect consumers’ health. Sex steroid hormones are part of animal metabolism; and so, all foodstuffs of animal origin contain these hormones, which have been connected with several human health problems. (See Why Do Vegan Women Have 5x Fewer Twins?) What effects might these female hormones have on men? See Dairy Estrogen and Male Fertility.

A-52	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/08/eat-protect-kidney-cancer/	What to Eat & What to Avoid to Protect Against Kidney Cancer	58,000 Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer every year, and 13,000 die. And the numbers have been rising. Approximately 4 percent of cases are hereditary, but what about the other 96 percent? Historically, the only accepted risk factor has been tobacco use, but cigarette smoking has been declining. So, what’s going on? Nitrosamines are one of the most potent carcinogens in cigarette smoke. One hot dog has as many nitrosamines and nitrosamides as five cigarettes. And these carcinogens are also found in fresh meat as well: beef, chicken, and pork. So, even though smoking rates have dropped, perhaps the rise in kidney cancer over the last few decades may have something to do with meat consumption. But would kidney cancer just be related to the processed meats like bacon, sausage, hot dogs, and cold cuts that have nitrate and nitrite additives, or fresh meat as well? The NIH-AARP study featured in my video Can Diet Protect Against Kidney Cancer? is the largest prospective study on diet and health ever performed—about 500,000 men and women followed for nine years. In addition to examining nitrate and nitrite intake from processed meat, they also looked at intake from other sources such as fresh meat, eggs, and dairy. Nitrite from all animal sources, not just processed meats, was associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer. The researchers found no associations with nitrate or nitrite intake from plant sources. When meat producers advertise their bacon or lunch meat as “uncured,” this means no nitrites or nitrates added. But if you look at the small print, you’ll see something like “except for celery juice.” That’s just a sneaky way to add nitrites. Processed meat producers ferment the nitrates in celery to create nitrites, then add it to the meat: a practice even the industry admits “may be viewed as incorrect at best or deceptive at worst.” But that same fermentation of nitrates to nitrites can happen thanks to bacteria on our tongue when we eat vegetables. So, why are nitrates and nitrites from vegetables on our tongue harmless, but nitrates and nitrites from vegetables in meat linked to cancer? The actual carcinogens are not nitrites, but nitrosamines and nitrosamides. In our stomach, to turn nitrites into nitros-amines, and nitros-amides, we need amines and amides, which are concentrated in animal products. And vitamin C and other antioxidants in plant foods block the formation of these carcinogens in our stomach. That’s why we can safely benefit from the nitrates in vegetables without the cancer risk. In fact, some of the highest nitrate vegetables, like arugula, kale, and collards, are associated with decreased risk of kidney cancer. The more plants, it appears, the better. Plant-based diets and fiber-rich diets are recommended to prevent cancer, as well as chronic conditions associated with kidney cancer, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes. It’s like sodium intake and kidney cancer. Sodium intake increases kidney disease risk, but that’s not just because sodium intake increases blood pressure. It appears the salt is associated with increased cancer risk even independently of hypertension. What about plant-based diets? Turns out the protective association remains even in people who are not obese and have normal blood pressure. So overall, plant-based and fiber-rich diets appear to do both: decrease cancer risk directly and indirectly. I briefly address kidney health in Preventing Kidney Failure Through Diet and Treating Kidney Failure Through Diet, but have a whole series of more in-depth videos dealing with various kidney issues.

A-53	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/06/paleo-diet-may-undermine-benefit-of-crossfit-exercise/	Paleo Diet May Undermine Benefit of CrossFit Exercise	Much of the low-carb and paleo reasoning revolves around insulin. To quote a paleo blogger, “carbohydrates increase insulin, the root of all evil when it comes to dieting and health.” So, the logic follows that because carbs increase insulin, we should stick mostly to meat, which is fat and protein with no carbs; so, no increase in insulin, right? Wrong. We’ve known for half a century that if you give someone just a steak: no carbs, no sugar, no starch; their insulin goes up. Carbs make our insulin go up, but so does protein. In 1997, an insulin index of foods was published, ranking 38 foods to determine which stimulates higher insulin levels. Researchers compared a large apple and all its sugar, a cup of oatmeal packed with carbs, a cup and a half of white flour pasta, a big bun-less burger with no carbs at all, to half of a salmon fillet. As you can see in the graph in my video Paleo Diets May Negate Benefits of Exercise, the meat produced the highest insulin levels. Researchers only looked at beef and fish, but subsequent data showed that that there’s no significant difference between the insulin spike from beef, chicken, or pork—they’re all just as high. Thus, protein and fat rich foods may induce substantial insulin secretion. In fact, meat protein causes as much insulin release as pure sugar. So, based on the insulin logic, if low-carbers and paleo folks really believed insulin to be the root of all evil, then they would be eating big bowls of spaghetti day in and day out before they would ever consume meat. They are correct in believing that having hyperinsulinemia, high levels of insulin in the blood like type 2 diabetics have, is not a good thing, and may increase cancer risk. But if low-carb and paleo dieters stuck to their own insulin theory, then they would be out telling everyone to start eating plant-based. Vegetarians have significantly lower insulin levels even at the same weight as omnivores. This is true for ovo-lacto-vegetarians, lacto-vegetarians, and vegans. Meat-eaters have up to 50% higher insulin levels. Researchers from the University of Memphis put a variety of people on a vegan diet (men, women, younger folks, older folks, skinny and fat) and their insulin levels dropped significantly within just three weeks. And then, just by adding egg whites back to their diet, their insulin production rose 60% within four days. In a study out of MIT, researchers doubled participants’ carbohydrate intake, and their insulin levels went down. Why? Because the researchers weren’t feeding people jellybeans and sugar cookies; they were feeding people whole, plant foods, lots of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables. What if we put someone on a very-low carb diet, like an Atkins diet? Low carb advocates, such as Dr. Westman, assumed that it would lower insulin levels. Dr. Westman is the author of the new Atkins books,  after Dr. Atkins died obese with, according to the medical examiner, a history of heart attack, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. But, Dr. Westman was wrong in his assumption. There is no significant drop in insulin levels on very low-carb diets. Instead, there is a significant rise in LDL cholesterol levels, the number one risk factor for our number one killer, heart disease. Atkins is an easy target though. No matter how many “new” Atkins diets that come out, it’s still old news. What about the paleo diet? The paleo movement gets a lot of things right. They tell people to ditch dairy and doughnuts, eat lots of fruits, nuts, and vegetables, and cut out a lot of processed junk food. But a new study published in the International Journal of Exercise Science is pretty concerning. Researchers took young healthy people, put them on a Paleolithic diet along with a CrossFit-based, high-intensity circuit training exercise program. If you lose enough weight exercising, you can temporarily drop your cholesterol levels no matter what you eat. You can see that with stomach stapling surgery, tuberculosis, chemotherapy, a cocaine habit, etc. Just losing weight by any means can lower cholesterol, which makes the results of the Paleo/Crossfit study all the more troubling. After ten weeks of hardcore workouts and weight loss, the participants’ LDL cholesterol still went up. And it was even worse for those who started out the healthiest. Those starting out with excellent LDL’s (under 70), had a 20% elevation in LDL cholesterol, and their HDL dropped. Exercise is supposed to boost our good cholesterol, not lower it. The paleo diet’s deleterious impact on blood fats was not only significant, but substantial enough to counteract the improvements commonly seen with improved fitness and body composition. Exercise is supposed to make things better. On the other hand, if we put people instead on a plant-based diet and a modest exercise program, mostly just walking-based, within three weeks their bad cholesterol can drop 20% and their insulin levels 30%, despite a 75-80% carbohydrate diet, whereas the paleo diets appeared to “negate the positive effects of exercise.” I touched on paleo diets before in Paleolithic Lessons, and I featured a guest blog on the subject: Will The Real Paleo Diet Please Stand Up? But my favorite paleo videos are probably The Problem With the Paleo Diet Argument and Lose Two Pounds in One Sitting: Taking the Mioscenic Route. I wrote a book on low carb diets in general (now available free full-text online) and touched on them in Atkins Diet: Trouble Keeping It Up and Low Carb Diets and Coronary Blood Flow. And if you’re thinking, but what about the size of the cholesterol, small and dense versus large and fluffy?

A-54	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/09/01/side-effects-of-aspartame-on-the-brain/	Side-Effects of Aspartame on the Brain	The National Institutes of Health AARP study of hundreds of thousands of Americans followed for years found that frequent consumption of sweetened beverages, especially diet drinks, may increase depression risk among older adults. Whether soda, fruit-flavored drinks, or iced tea, those artificially sweetened drinks appeared to carry higher risk. There was a benefit in coffee drinkers compared to non-drinkers, but if they added sugar, much of the benefits appeared to disappear, and if they added Equal or Sweet-and-Low, the risk appeared to go up. Various effects of artificial sweeteners, including neurological effects, have been suspected. For example, aspartame—the chemical in Equal and Nutrasweet—may modulate brain neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, although data have been controversial and inconsistent. Scientific opinions range from “safe under all conditions” to “unsafe at any dose.” The controversy started in the 80’s soon after aspartame was approved. Researchers at the Mass College of Pharmacy and MIT noted: “given the very large number of Americans routinely exposed, if only 1% of the 100,000,000 Americans thought to consume aspartame ever exceed the sweetener’s acceptable daily intake, and if only 1% of this group happen coincidentally to have an underlying disease that makes their brains vulnerable to the effects, then the number of people who might manifest adverse brain reactions attributable to aspartame could still be about 10,000, a number on the same order as the number of brain and nerve-related consumer complaints already registered with the FDA before they stopped accepting further reports on adverse reactions to the sweetener.” Those with a history of depression might be especially vulnerable. Researchers at Case Western designed a study I highlighted in my video Aspartame and the Brain to ascertain whether individuals with mood disorders are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of aspartame. Although they had planned on recruiting 40 patients with depression and 40 controls, the project was halted early by the Institutional Review Board for safety reasons because of the severity of reactions to aspartame within the group of patients with a history of depression. It was decided that it was unethical to continue to expose people to the stuff. Normally, when we study a drug or a food, the company donates the product to the researchers because they’re proud of the benefits or safety of their product. But the Nutrasweet company refused to even sell it to these researchers. The researchers managed to get their hands on some, and within a week, there were significantly more adverse effects reported in the aspartame group than in the placebo group. They concluded that individuals with mood disorders may be particularly sensitive to aspartame, and therefore, its use in this population should be discouraged. In a review of the direct and indirect cellular effects of aspartame on the brain, it was noted that there are reports of aspartame causing neurological and behavioral disturbances in sensitive individuals, such as headaches, insomnia, and seizures. The researchers go even further and propose that excessive aspartame ingestion might be involved in the development of certain mental disorders and also in compromised learning and emotional functioning. They conclude that “due to all the adverse effects caused by aspartame, it is suggested that serious further testing and research be undertaken to eliminate any and all controversies,” to which someone responded in the journal that “there really is no controversy,” arguing that aspartame was conclusively toxic. But what do they mean by excessive ingestion? The latest study on the neuro-behavioral effects of aspartame consumption put people on a high aspartame diet compared to a low aspartame diet. But even the high dose at 25 mg/kg was only half the adequate daily intake set by the FDA. The FDA says one can safely consume 50mg a day, but after just eight days on half of that, participants had more irritable mood, exhibited more depression, and performed worse on certain brain function tests. And these weren’t people with a pre-existing history of mental illness; these were just regular people. The researchers concluded that “given that the higher intake level tested here was well below the maximum acceptable daily intake level [40mg in Europe, 50mg here] careful consideration is warranted when consuming food products that may affect neurobehavioral health.” Easier said than done, since it’s found in more than 6,000 foods, apparently making artificial sweeteners “impossible to completely eradicate from daily exposure.” While that may be true for the great majority of Americans, it’s only because they elect to eat processed foods. If we stick to whole foods, we don’t even have to read the ingredients lists, because the healthiest foods in the supermarket are label-free, they don’t even have ingredients lists—produce! I’ve previously touched on artificial sweeteners before: The healthiest caloric sweeteners are blackstrap molasses and date sugar (whole dried powdered dates). The least toxic low-calorie sweetener is probably erythritol (Erythritol May Be a Sweet Antioxidant). Coffee may decrease suicide and cancer risk (Preventing Liver Cancer with Coffee? and Coffee and Cancer) but may impair blood flow to the heart (Coffee and Artery Function).

A-55	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/30/poultry-and-weight-gain/	Poultry & Weight Gain	Vegetarians have considerably lower obesity rates compared to those who eat meat, but why? Is it because they’re not eating meat or because they’re eating more plants? Or maybe they’re just eating fewer calories or exercising more? A study out of the Netherlands controlled for all of that, as profiled in my video, Chicken Big: Poultry and Obesity. Researchers effectively studied men and women who ate the same number of calories a day, ate the same amount of vegetables, fruits, grains and did the same amount of exercise, but ate different amounts of meat. Men and women who ate less than a small serving of meat a day were on average not overweight, but the more meat they ate, the heavier they were. By one and a half servings a day, they crossed the threshold of a BMI of 25 to become officially classified as overweight.  Which type of meat was the worst? I previously profiled a study of hundreds of thousands of men and women which showed that poultry consumption appeared to be the worst (see Meat and Weight Gain in the PANACEA Study). But maybe it was reverse causation, meaning obesity leading to greater chicken consumption and not the other way around. The new study controlled for that, adjusting for dieting habits, yet found the same thing. Chicken consumption was most associated with weight gain in both men and women, and it didn’t take much. Compared to those who didn’t eat any chicken at all, those eating about 20 or more grams of chicken a day had a significantly greater increase in their body mass index. That’s around one chicken nugget, or a single chicken breast once every two weeks compared to no chicken at all. Why poultry though? We don’t know, but here are some possible contributing factors: Other surprising discoveries in the field include: 	-	animal products,calories,chicken,exercise,fruit,grains,meat,obesity,plant-based diets,poultry,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-big-poultry-and-obesity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592131,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-big-poultry-and-obesity/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22223576,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/

A-57	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/23/role-caffeine-artery-function/	The Role of Caffeine in Artery Function	There are dietary guidelines for food, but what about for beverages? A Beverage Guidance Panel was “assembled to provide guidance on the relative health and nutritional benefits and risks of various beverage categories.” They ranked them from one to six, and water was ranked number one. Soda ranked last at number six. Whole milk was grouped with beer, with a recommendation for zero ounces a day, in part out of concern for links between milk and prostate cancer, as well as aggressive ovarian cancer. Number two on the list, though, after water, was tea and coffee, preferably without creamer or sweetener. Even without creamer, though, lots of unfiltered coffee can raise cholesterol, but the oily cholesterol-raising compounds are trapped by the paper filter in brewed coffee, so filtered coffee is probably better. But about ten years ago, a study was published on the effects of coffee on endothelial function, the function of our arteries. I profile this study in my video Coffee and Artery Function, showing that within 30 minutes of drinking a cup of coffee there was a significant drop in the ability of our arteries to dilate, whereas decaf did not seem to have a significant effect. This was the first study to demonstrate an acute unfavorable effect on arterial function of caffeinated coffee, but one cup of decaf didn’t seem to affect performance. And two cups of decaf appeared to have a beneficial effect. So maybe it’s a “battle between caffeine and antioxidants.” Something in caffeinated coffee appears to be hurting arterial function, whereas something in decaf appears to be helping. It’s similar to red wine. “De-alcoholized” (nonalcoholic) red wine significantly improves arterial function, as there are grape components trying to help, but the presence of alcohol counteracts and erases the benefit. Drinking really high antioxidant coffee, for example by preparing it Greek style (where you actually drink the grounds), coffee drinkers may actually be at an advantage It might not be the caffeine in caffeinated coffee that’s the harmful component, though. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, researchers found that caffeine alone—about two and a half cups of coffee worth—significantly improved arterial function in both people with and without heart disease. Coffee contains more than a thousand different compounds other than caffeine, many of which are also removed by the decaffeination process, so there must be something else in the coffee bean that’s causing the problem. In fact, caffeine may even enhance the repair of the fragile inner lining of our arteries by enhancing the migration of our endothelial progenitor cells, the stem cells that patch up potholes in our artery walls. But how might we get the potential benefit of caffeine without the risky compounds in caffeinated coffee? Tea! Tea consumption enhances artery function, and there are substantial beneficial effects of both green tea and black tea. Instead of other components in tea leaves undermining caffeine’s potential benefits, they appear to boost the benefit in healthy individuals, as well as heart disease patients, reversing some of their arterial dysfunction, both immediately and long-term. All the measurements in the studies I’ve talked about so far were done on the brachial artery, the main artery in the arm (just because it’s easier to get to). What we care about, though, is blood flow to the heart. And caffeine appears to impair blood flow to our heart muscle during exercise even in healthy folks, but especially in those with heart disease. Thankfully caffeine in tea form appears to have the opposite effect, significantly improving coronary blood flow, suggesting that tea consumption has a beneficial effect on coronary circulation, though the addition of milk may undermine the protective effects. I’m fascinated by how complicated such a simple question can get! The take-home is that water is the healthiest beverage, followed by tea. The effects of coffee on cancer risk are more salutary: I also have videos on the effects on artery function of walnuts, dark chocolate, tea, eggs, salt, olive oil, vinegar, fatty meals, and plant-based diets in general. Low Carb Diets and Coronary Blood Flow is one of the few other studies I’ve done that measured blood flow within the coronary arteries themselves. For more background on the brachial artery test, see my video The Power of NO.

A-58	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/18/big-food-twists-science/	How Big Food Twists the Science	Just like mosquitos are the vectors of spread for malaria, a landmark article published recently in one of the most prestigious medical journals described large food corporations as the vectors of spread for chronic disease. Unlike “infectious disease epidemics, however, these corporate disease vectors implement sophisticated campaigns to undermine public health interventions.” Most mosquitoes don’t have as good PR firms. A key message was that “alcohol and ultra-processed food and drink industries use similar strategies as the tobacco industry to undermine effective public health policies and programs.” What they mean by ultra-processed is things like burgers, frozen meals, chicken nuggets, fish sticks, potato chips, doughnuts and soda pop. But how is the food industry like the tobacco industry? The “first strategy is to bias research findings.” For example, Philip Morris implemented the Whitecoat project to hire doctors to publish ghost-written studies purporting to negate links between secondhand smoke and harm, publishing biased cherry-picked scientific reports to deny harm and suppress health information. In my video Food Industry-Funded Research Bias, you can see the actual industry memo describing the Whitecoat Project, designed to reverse the scientific “misconception” that secondhand smoke is harmful. Similarly, funding from these large food corporations biases research. Studies show systematic bias from industry funding; so, we get the same kind of tactics—supplying misinformation, use of supposedly conflicting evidence, and hiding negative data.  The same scientists-for-hire that downplayed the risks of secondhand smoke are the same hired by the likes of the National Confectioner’s Association to say candy cigarettes are A-OK as well. Of course, they declared “no conflict of interest.” The similarities between strategies used by the tobacco, alcohol, and food and drink corporations are unsurprising in view of the flow of people, funds and activities across these industries, which also have histories of joint ownership—like Philip Morris owned both Kraft and Miller Brewing. So what’s their strategy? As a former FDA commissioner described: “The tobacco industry’s strategy was embodied in a script written by the lawyers. Every tobacco company executive in the public eye was told to learn the script backwards and forwards, no deviation was allowed. The basic premise was simple— smoking had not been proven to cause cancer. Not proven, not proven, not proven—this would be stated insistently and repeatedly. Inject a thin wedge of doubt, create controversy, never deviate from the prepared line. It was a simple plan and it worked.” Internal industry memos make this explicit, stating “doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the mind of the general public.” The internal industry memos list objective number one as “to set aside in the minds of millions the false conviction that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases; a conviction based on fanatical assumptions, fallacious rumors, unsupported claims and the unscientific statements and conjectures of publicity-seeking opportunists… [We need] to lift the cigarette from the cancer identification as quickly as possible, and to establish—once and for all—that no scientific evidence has ever been produced, presented or submitted to prove conclusively that cigarette smoking causes cancer,” similar to what’s now coming out from the food industry, from the same folks that brought us smoke and candy. This is part of a series of “political” blogs which includes my video, Collaboration with the New Vectors of Disease. Why don’t I just “stick to the science”? When there are billions of dollars at stake, the body of evidence can be skewed and manipulated. Funders can determine which studies are performed, how they’re performed and whether or not they get published at all. That’s why I think it’s important to take a broader view to account for the ways the scientific method can be perverted for profit.

A-59	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/16/introducing-the-kempner-rice-diet/	Introducing the Kempner Rice Diet	Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought us through the Great Depression and World War II. Who knows how history would have been different had he not died in his fourth term as President from a massive stroke. In the following days and months, we learned that Roosevelt had suffered from severe high blood pressure for years. In spite of this, he was on no medications or other treatments. The reason for the lack of treatment is stark and simple: there were none. The state of the art at that time was death. Death, from so-called malignant hypertension—out-of-control high blood pressure—for which, it was thought, there was no remedy. But they were wrong. There was Dr. Walter Kempner and his rice-fruit diet. A physician-scientist, Kempner trained with the best, fled Nazi Germany and set up shop at Duke, where he began treating malignant hypertension patients with a radical diet consisting of only white rice and fruit, with strikingly favorable results: a rapid reduction in blood pressure, rapid improvement in kidney failure, eye pressure, heart failure and other manifestations of this previously fatal illness. He figured that if a low salt diet helped with blood pressure, a low protein diet helped with kidney function, and a low fat and cholesterol diet helped the heart, why not take it to its logical conclusion and design a no-salt, no cholesterol diet of almost pure carbohydrate. So, he designed a diet with less sodium than any low-sodium diet, less protein than any low-protein diet, and less cholesterol and fat than any other low-fat diet. His hope was that it would just stop progression of the disease. Instead, something miraculous happened. In about two-thirds of cases, the disease reversed. There were reversals of heart failure, reversals of eye damage, and reversals of kidney failure. At the time, this was effectively a terminal disease where people just had a few months to live, but with Kempner’s rice diet, they got better. In my video Kempner Rice Diet: Whipping Us Into Shape, you can see before and after pictures of the back of people’s eyes. They started out swollen, bloody and leaking and then were nearly normal in a matter of months. After being effectively cured by the diet over many months, many patients could then relax the diet to a more conventional plant-based diet and go on to live a normal, active life. The rice diet may actually drop blood pressures too low; so, we have to add back other foods to bring the pressures back up to normal. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine described Kempner’s results as “little short of miraculous.” Practically speaking, there’s probably no more effective diet for obese cardiac patients. The problem, though, is that most physicians lack the extraordinary persuasive powers required to keep the patient eating such a restricted diet. When Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn presented his study results demonstrating in some cases reversal of near end-stage heart disease with a whole food plant-based diet, the Chair of Cleveland Clinic cardiology department asked, “How can we expect patients to stay on a strict diet like this when we can’t even get them to quit smoking?” Just like penicillin drugs don’t work at all unless we take them, plant-based diets don’t work unless we actually eat them. The answer may be that the physician must have a zealous belief in the diet and must convey that passion to the patients. For Kempner, to keep his patients on the rice diet, he “brow-beat, yelled at, and castigated them when he caught them straying.” And he didn’t just browbeat them; he sometimes actually beat them. It came out in a lawsuit in which a former patient sued Dr. Kempner, claiming that he had literally whipped her and other patients to motivate them to stick to the diet. Reminds me of the famous diabetes physician back in the 1800s, Arnoldo Cantani, who knew the remedy for diabetes was not in the drugstore, but rather the kitchen. To ensure compliance, if necessary, he would lock a patient up in a room for six weeks. Thankfully, in terms of personality, Dr. Esselstyn is the opposite of Dr. Kempner. He is polite, soft-spoken, gentle and able to keep his patients on track without whipping them. And last but not least, Esselstyn walks the talk, following the diet himself, whereas Kempner died of a heart attack (though at the age of 94). Kempner’s work continues on in Durham, where they continue a relaxed version of the diet, allowing actual vegetables. A year before Roosevelt died, Kempner had already published his miraculous results. It seems highly likely that had the rice diet been “provided to President Roosevelt a year before his death, his disease might have been controlled before his fatal stroke, and that this fatal event could have been averted.” For those unfamiliar with Dr. Esselstyn’s work, check out: Kempner was a lifestyle medicine pioneer.

A-60	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/11/preventing-and-treating-low-back-pain-with-diet/	Preventing & Treating Low Back Pain With Diet	Low back pain became one of the biggest problems for public health systems in the Western world during the second half of the 20th century. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is reported to be as high as 84 percent, and chronic low back pain is present in about one in five, with one in ten being disabled. It’s an epidemic. Are people just lifting more heavy stuff? No. “[M]echanical factors, such as lifting and carrying, probably do not have a major role in this disease.” Atherosclerosis can obstruct the arteries that feed the spine, and this diminished blood flow can result in various back problems. This can be seen on special scans. Check them out in my video, Back in Circulation: The Link Between Sciatica and Cholesterol, where you can see the difference between normal and clogged spinal arteries. I also show what they look like on autopsy, where we can see the openings to the spinal arteries getting squeezed shut by cholesterol-filled plaques. Now, we have MRI imaging that can show the occlusion of spinal arteries in people with back pain, and the degeneration of the discs. Researchers showed that patients with long-term lower back pain had constricted blood flow, and those with high cholesterol appeared to suffer with more severe symptoms. Those with narrowed arteries appear about eight-and-a-half times more likely to have suffered from chronic back pain.  Although disc degeneration has multiple causal factors, with genetic, occupational, and mechanical influences, alteration in nutrition has been proposed as the final common pathway. This makes sense. The discs in our lower back are the largest “avascular” tissue in the body, meaning our discs don’t have any blood vessels. Thus, its nutrition just kind of diffuses in from the margins, making it especially vulnerable to deprivation. Using MRIs, we can measure the effects of impaired blood flow on that diffusion. Because of this vulnerability, discs degenerate far earlier than other musculoskeletal tissues; the first unequivocal findings of degeneration in the discs of the lower spine are seen starting around age 11. Nearly all kids have the beginnings of atherosclerosis by age ten (Heart Disease Starts in Childhood). By the early teen years, we can already see the disks starting to deteriorate. By age 49, 97% percent of the discs of those eating the Standard American Diet show at least grade-2 degradation. Cholesterol plaques in the wall of the aorta obliterate the openings of spinal arteries. Structures with precarious nutrient supply, such as the intervertebral discs, may suffer and gradually degenerate, as well as herniate. There is a link not only between  cholesterol levels and disc degeneration, but also between cholesterol levels and disc herniation. This compromised blood flow may also damage the nerve roots that come off the spine, causing sciatica. Sciatica is back pain that radiates down the legs, causing additional pain, numbness or weakness, and prolonged disability. Sciatica affects as many as 1 in 20 people. Independent of weight, clinical sciatica may be associated with blood cholesterol levels as well. The nerve roots, which are most commonly associated with sciatic pain, are supplied by some of the arteries most vulnerable to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Obliteration of these arteries by cholesterol buildup results in compromised nutrient supply to the nerve itself. That lack of oxygen to the nerve may play a role in the sciatic nerve crying out in pain. Reduced blood flow also hampers the removal of waste products, such as lactic acid, which can irritate the nerve endings, causing pain and deterioration.  Sadly, low back pain is now common in children and adolescents, and getting worse. Similarly, children are now getting disorders like adult-onset diabetes. Teenagers, starting out their lives with a chronic disease; that’s why it’s never too early to start eating healthier. 	-	adolescence,angiography,back pain,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,children,cholesterol,chronic diseases,erectile dysfunction,heart disease,heart health,lactic acid,lower back pain,nerve health,pain,sciatica,Standard American Diet	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-in-circulation-sciatica-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23351394,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389219,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11719678,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461389,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17825307,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3406837,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/back-in-circulation-sciatica-and-cholesterol/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19328027,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15454707,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC165040/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21387192,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564919,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982256,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17260394	
A-61	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/08/09/what-about-all-the-sugar-in-fruit/	What About All the Sugar in Fruit?	If the fructose in sugar and high fructose corn syrup has been considered “alcohol without the buzz” in terms of the potential to inflict liver damage, what about the source of natural fructose, fruit? If you compare the effects of a diet restricting fructose from both added sugars and fruit to one just restricting fructose from added sugars, the diet that kept the fruit did better. People lost more weight with the extra fruit present than if all fructose was restricted. Only industrial, not fruit fructose intake, was associated with declining liver function and high blood pressure. Fructose from added sugars was associated with hypertension; fructose from natural fruits is not. If we have people drink a glass of water with three tablespoons of table sugar in it, which is like a can of soda, they get a big spike in blood sugar within the first hour (as you can see in my video If Fructose is Bad, What About Fruit?). Our body freaks out and releases so much insulin we actually overshoot, and by the second hour we’re relatively hypoglycemic, dropping our blood sugar below where it was when we started out. In response, our body dumps fat into our blood stream as if we’re starving, because our blood sugars just dropped so low so suddenly. What if you eat blended berries in addition to the sugar? They have sugars of their own in them; in fact, an additional tablespoon of sugar worth; so, the blood sugar spike should be worse, right? Not only was there no additional blood sugar spike, there was no hypoglycemic dip afterwards. Blood sugar just went up and down without that overshoot and without the surge of fat into the blood. This difference may be attributed to the semisolid consistency of the berry meals, which may have decreased the rate of stomach emptying compared with just guzzling sugar water. In addition, the soluble fiber in the berries has a gelling effect in our intestines that slows the release of sugars. To test to see if it was the fiber, researchers repeated the experiment with berry juice that had all the sugar but none of the fiber. A clear difference was observed early on in the blood sugar insulin responses. At the 15-minute mark, the blood sugar spike was significantly reduced by the berry meals, but not by the juices, but the rest of the beneficial responses were almost the same between the juice and the whole fruit, suggesting that fiber may just be part of it. It turns out there are fruit phytonutrients that inhibit the transportation of sugars through the intestinal wall into our blood stream. Phytonutrients in foods like apples and strawberries can block some of the uptake of sugars by the cells lining our intestines. Adding berries can actually blunt the insulin spike from high glycemic foods. For example, white bread creates a big insulin spike within two hours after eating it. Eat that same white bread with some berries, though, and we’re able to blunt the spike. So, even though we’ve effectively added more sugars in the form of berries, there’s less of an insulin spike, which has a variety of potential short and long-term benefits. So, if you’re going to make pancakes, make sure they’re blueberry pancakes. Surprised about the juice results? Me too!

A-63	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/28/inhibiting-platelet-activation-tomato-seeds/	Inhibiting Platelet Activation with Tomato Seeds	In the prevention of cardiovascular disease, the consumption of fruits and vegetables is crucial. Preventing the oxidation of cholesterol may be one of the mechanisms by which fruits and vegetables reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, hyperactivity of platelets is also critically important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, as I’ve covered before (See Inhibiting Platelet Aggregation with Berries). In recent years, it has been shown that platelets are not only involved in the arterial clotting process, but also that they play an active role in the inflammatory process of atherosclerosis from childhood. By the end of our teens, atherosclerotic lesions are present in most people living in industrialized societies; and so, suppressing the over-activity of platelets may be beneficial not only for heart disease, but for cancer, allergies, and diseases for which inflammation plays a major role. The antioxidant properties of fruits and veggies are well known. However, their anti-clotting effects on platelets are less known. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the platelet activation suppressing activity of a variety of fruits and vegetables. They suppress platelet activation so well that they can actually mess up platelet function tests. And, the effects are so long-lasting that fasting the morning of your blood test may not be sufficient. Out of 16 different fruits tested, tomatoes came out number one. The anti-platelet activation components in tomatoes are water soluble, so we don’t have to eat them with fat; heat stable, meaning we can cook tomatoes without losing the benefits; and concentrated in the yellow fluid around the seeds. This is why tomato pomace beat out tomato juice, sauce, or ketchup. Pomace is basically the seeds and the peel, which the industry throws away, and it may be the healthiest part. And, the more tomato seeds, the better. But this study was measuring platelet activation in a petri dish. Grapefruit came in number two here, and grapefruit juice at least didn’t appear to help when people actually drank it. Would drinking tomato juice actually help? Platelets of patients with diabetes are characterized by intensified activation; so, 20 diabetics were asked to drink a daily cup of tomato juice for three weeks or a tomato-flavored placebo beverage, and there was a significant drop in platelet activation. A study done by the Rowett Research Institute, highlighted in my video, Inhibiting Platelet Activation with Tomato Seeds, found this works in healthy people as well. Within three hours of consumption, two tomatoes lowered platelet activation, and six tomatoes worked even better. Also, the effects were more wide-ranging than those of aspirin, in that the tomatoes targeted multiple pathways of platelet activation. About one in four people are aspirin resistant, meaning aspirin doesn’t work to calm down their platelets, whereas only 3% of study subjects were found to be tomato resistant. This finding indicates an advantage of the tomato extract’s broad antiplatelet activity profile over single-target drugs such as aspirin. Also, when researchers stuck tubes into people while they were eating tomatoes, they found no changes in blood clotting times, implying that supplementation with tomatoes should not result in a prolonged bleeding times; so, one might get the best of both worlds: less platelet activation without the bleeding risk. But, if tomatoes don’t thin our blood, do they work? Researchers out of North Carolina State University report that, “consumption of tomato products has been found to be protectively correlated with a lower incidence of acute coronary events, less development of early atherosclerosis, and lower mortality from heart disease.” If you don’t like tomatoes, kiwifruit recently beat them out in a test tube study of platelet activation. Strawberries may help too, but we have data showing kiwis may actually work in people, and two kiwis appeared to work just as well as three kiwis. It appears to work for green-on-the-inside kiwifruit, and for yellow-on-the-inside kiwifruit. In this case, though, one a day seemed to help, whereas two-a-day did not, which seems a little strange. And, there haven’t been any studies to see if kiwifruit eaters actually have fewer strokes and heart attacks; so, the best evidence for a dietary intervention to decrease platelet activation currently rests with tomatoes. One of my favorite videos, The Tomato Effect, is actually not about tomatoes at all, but talks about the power of a diet composed entirely of plants to combat the heart disease epidemic. After all, Heart Disease Starts in Childhood.

A-64	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/26/preventing-alzheimers-disease-diet/	Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease with Diet	Up to half of Alzheimer’s cases may be attributable to just seven risk factors shown in my video, Preventing Alzheimer’s with Lifestyle Changes, which include diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, exercise, smoking, depression, and mental exercise; and that’s not including diet because there are so many dietary factors that researchers couldn’t fit them into their model. But, they acknowledged that diet might be another important modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, there is growing evidence that dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, are associated with lower Alzheimer’s risk, as well as slower cognitive decline, but which constituents of the Mediterranean diet are responsible? The traditional Mediterranean diet is a diet high in intake of vegetables, beans, fruit, and nuts, and low in meat and dairy. When researchers tried to tease out the protective components, fish consumption showed no benefit, neither did moderate alcohol consumption. The two critical pieces appeared to be vegetable consumption, and the ratio between unsaturated fats and saturated fats, essentially plant fats to animal fats. In studies across 11 countries, fat consumption appeared to be most closely correlated with the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, with the lowest fat intake and Alzheimer’s rates in China to the highest fat intake and Alzheimer’s rates in the United States. But this is grouping all fats together. Harvard researchers examined the relationships of the major fat types to cognitive change over four years among 6,000 healthy older women, and found that higher saturated fat intake was associated with a poorer trajectory of cognition and memory. Women with the highest saturated fat intake had 60 to 70% greater odds of worse change on brain function. The magnitude of cognitive change associated with saturated fat consumption was equivalent to about six years of aging, meaning women with the lowest saturated fat intake had the brain function of women six years younger. What if one already has Alzheimer’s, though? Previously, a group of Columbia University researchers reported that eating a Mediterranean-style diet was related to lower risk for Alzheimer’s disease, but whether a Mediterranean diet—or any diet for that matter—is associated with the subsequent course of the disease and outcomes had not been investigated, until now. In a study highlighted in my video, Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease with Diet, researchers found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet may affect not only risk for Alzheimer’s disease, but also subsequent disease course, as higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower mortality. And the more they adhered to the healthier diet, the longer they lived. Within five years, only 20% of those with high adherence died, with twice as many deaths in the intermediate adherence group. In the low adherence group, within five years, more than half were dead, and by ten years, 90% were gone. By the end of the study, the only people still alive were those with higher adherence to the healthier diet. For more on the Mediterranean diet, check out: I do have a bunch on dietary factors in cognitive decline, though: 	-	alcohol,Alzheimer’s disease,animal fat,beans,brain disease,brain health,China,cognition,dairy,dementia,fish,fruit,meat,Mediterranean diet,nuts,saturate fat,vegetables	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-lifestyle-changes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20502015,http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775213,http://www.sunarc.org/JAD97.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23680940,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22605573,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846408,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-lifestyle-changes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-65	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/21/preventing-alzheimers-lifestyle-changes/	Preventing Alzheimer’s with Lifestyle Changes	It’s safe to say that Alzheimer’s disease research is in a “state of crisis.” For the past two decades, over 73,000 research articles have been published, yet little clinical progress has been made. The reason a cure may be impossible is because lost cognitive functions in Alzheimer’s disease patients are due to fatally damaged neuronal networks, and dead nerve cells cannot be brought back to life. Consequently, replacement with new brain cells—even if it were technically possible, cannot be done without creating a new personal identity. One may live, but is it really a cure if their personality is lost forever? Developing drugs that try to clear out the plaques from advanced degenerated brain tissue, therefore, makes about as much sense as bulldozing tombstones from graveyards in an attempt to raise the dead. Even if drug companies figured out how to halt further disease progression, many Alzheimer’s victims might not choose to live without being able to recognize family, friends, or themselves in a mirror. Thus, prevention of Alzheimer’s seems to be the key. Alzheimer’s disease, like heart attacks or strokes, needs to be prevented by controlling vascular risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol, controlling what’s called “chronic brain hypoperfusion,” the lack of adequate blood flow to the brain over the years before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. This means a healthy diet, physical exercise and mental exercise. In the video, Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease with Lifestyle Changes, you can see a visual of the potential number of Alzheimer’s cases that could be prevented every year in the United States if we could just reduce diabetes rates 10 percent or 25 percent, since diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s. And, so is high blood pressure, depression, not exercising your body, smoking, and not exercising your brain. Altogether, a small reduction in all of these risk factors could potentially prevent hundreds of thousands of devastated families. If modifiable factors such as diet were found conclusively to modulate the risk of Alzheimer’s disease to the degree suggested by this research, then we would all indeed rejoice at the implications. My mom’s mom died of Alzheimer’s. It is worth preventing at all costs. Up to half of Alzheimer’s cases may be attributable to just those seven risk factors, and that’s not even including diet, because there were so many dietary factors that they couldn’t fit them into their model. What role does diet play? That’s the subject of my video, Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease with Diet. So far these are some of the videos I’ve done on dementia prevention and treatment: 	-	Alzheimer’s disease,blood pressure,brain disease,brain health,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,cholesterol,cognition,dementia,depression,diabetes,exercise,heart disease,heart health,hypertension,mortality,smoking,stroke	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-lifestyle-changes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11176918,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-with-lifestyle-changes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22422426,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-alzheimers-disease-with-diet/%20	
A-66	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/19/much-added-sugar-much/	How Much Added Sugar is Too Much?	In 1776, at the time of the American Revolution, Americans consumed about four pounds of sugar per person each year. By 1850, this had risen to 20 pounds, and by 1994 to 120 pounds. Now, we’re closer to 160 (See How Much Added Sugar is Too Much?). Half of table sugar is fructose, taking up about 10 percent of our diet. This is not from eating apples, but rather the fact that we’re each guzzling the equivalent of a 16-ounce soft drink every day; that’s about 50 gallons a year. Even researchers paid by the likes of the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and The Coca Cola Company acknowledge that sugar is empty calories, containing “no essential micronutrients, and therefore if we’re trying to reduce calorie intake, reducing sugar consumption is obviously the place to start.” Concern has been raised, though, that sugar calories may be worse than just empty. A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that “the fructose added to foods and beverages in the form of table sugar and high fructose corn syrup in large enough amounts can trigger processes that lead to liver toxicity and other chronic diseases.” Fructose hones in like a laser beam on the liver, and like alcohol, fructose can increase the fat in the liver. The increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most remarkable medical developments over the past three decades—the emergence of fatty liver inflammation as a public health problem here and around the globe. These may not be messages that the sugar industry or beverage makers want to hear. In response, the director-general of the industry front group, the World Sugar Research Organization, replied, “Overconsumption of anything is harmful, including water and air.” Yes, he compared the overconsumption of sugar to breathing too much. Under American Heart Association’s new sugar guidelines, most American women should consume no more than 100 calories per day from added sugars, and most American men should eat or drink no more than 150. That means one can of soda could take us over the top for the day. The new draft guidelines from the World Health Organization suggest we could benefit from restricting added sugars to under 5 percent of calories. That’s about six spoonfuls of added sugar. I don’t know why they don’t just recommend zero as optimal, but you can get a sense of how radical their proposal is given that we consume an average of 12-18 spoonfuls a day right now. This underscores why a whole foods, plant-based diet is preferable to a plant-based diet that includes processed junk. I’ve touched on the harm of refined sugars before in: For healthful alternatives in baking, see The Healthiest Sweetener, and for beverages, Erythritol May Be a Sweet Antioxidant. 	-	alcohol,American Heart Association,apples,calories,chronic diseases,Coca Cola,empty calories,fatty liver disease,fructose,high fructose corn syrup,industry influence,liver disease,liver inflammation,soda,sugar,World Health Organization	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622183,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23053554,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704096,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652726,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7388/full/483158d.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23493538,http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7383/full/482027a.html%3FWT.ec_id=NATURE-20120202?message-global=remove&WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120202	
A-67	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/14/caloric-restriction-vs-plant-based-diets/	Caloric Restriction vs. Plant-Based Diets	Hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States every year are attributed to obesity, now overtaking smoking as perhaps the main preventable cause of illness and premature death. In particular, excess body fatness is an important cause of most cancers, according to a meta-analysis of studies done to date. For some cancers, about half of the cases may be attributable to just being overweight or obese. What’s the connection, though? Why do individuals who are obese have increased cancer risk? To answer this question, we must consider the biochemical consequences of obesity, like IGF-1; insulin like growth factor one is a cancer-promoting growth hormone associated with a variety of common cancers in adults, as well as children. Kids who got cancer had about four times the levels of IGF-1 circulating in their bloodstream, whereas people growing up with abnormally low levels of IGF-1 don’t seem to get cancer at all. I’ve talked about this cancer-proofing mutation (See Cancer-Proofing Mutation), the role animal protein intake plays in boosting IGF-1 production from our liver (Protein Intake & IGF-1 Production), which may explain plant-based protection from cancer (The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle), and how plant-based one has to eat (How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?), but our liver is not the only tissue that produces IGF-1; fat cells produce IGF-1 too. That may help explain this “twenty-first century cancer epidemic caused by obesity.” So, of course, drug companies have come up with a variety of IGF-1 blocking chemo agents, with cute names like figitumamab, but with not-so-cute side effects “such as early fatal toxicities.” So, perhaps better to lower IGF-1 the natural way, by eating a plant-based diet, as vegan women and men have lower IGF-1 levels. Maybe, though, it’s just because they’re so skinny. The only dietary group that comes close to the recommended BMI of 21 to 23 were those eating strictly plant-based diets; so, maybe it’s the weight loss that did it. Maybe we can eat whatever we want as long as we’re skinny. To put that to the test, we’d have to find a group of people that eat meat, but are still as slim as vegans. And that’s what researchers did – long-distance endurance runners, running an average of 48 miles a week for 21 years were as slim as vegans. If we run 50,000 miles, we too can maintain a BMI of even a raw vegan. So, what did they find? If we look at blood concentrations of cancer risk factors among the groups of study subjects, we see that only the vegans had significantly lower levels of IGF-1. That makes sense given the role animal protein plays in boosting IGF-1 levels. But the vegan group didn’t just eat less animal protein, they ate fewer calories. And in rodents at least, caloric restriction alone reduces IGF-1 levels. So, maybe low IGF-1 among vegans isn’t due to their slim figures, but maybe the drop in IGF-1 in vegans is effectively due to their unintentional calorie restriction. So, we have to compare vegans to people practicing severe calorie restriction. To do this, the researchers recruited vegans from the St. Louis Vegetarian Society, and went to the Calorie Restriction Society to find folks practicing severe caloric restriction. What did they find? Only the vegan group got a significant drop in IGF-1. These findings demonstrate that, unlike in rodents, long-term severe caloric restriction in humans does not reduce the level of this cancer-promoting hormone. It’s not how many calories we eat, but the protein intake that may be the key determinant of circulating IGF-1 levels in humans; and so, reduced protein intake may become an important component of anti-cancer and anti-aging dietary interventions. That same data set that compared plant eaters to marathon runners was also featured in Hibiscus Tea vs. Plant-Based Diets for Hypertension and Arteries of Vegans vs. Runners. These studies are highlighted in my video Caloric Restriction vs. Plant-based Diets.

A-68	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/12/gmo-soy-breast-cancer/	GMO Soy & Breast Cancer	In response to concerns raised about the toxicity of Monsanto’s roundup pesticide, which ends up in GMO foods (See Is Monsanto’s Roundup Pesticide Glyphosate Safe?), Monsanto’s scientists countered that these in vitro experiments used physiological irrelevant concentrations, meaning dripping roundup on cells in a petri dish at levels far above what would be realistically found in the human body. Sure, it’s probably not a good idea to mix up your alcohol with your roundup and chug the stuff, or try to commit suicide by drinking or injecting it. And there are rare cases of Parkinson’s reported after getting directly sprayed with it, or working for years in a pesticide production plant, but that’s not your typical consumer exposure. As shown in my video GMO Soy and Breast Cancer, some of the researchers responded to the accusation claiming they used the kinds of concentrations that are used out in the fields. Therefore every little droplet we spray worldwide is above the threshold concentration they found to cause adverse effects. Monsanto’s folks responded saying, “Yes, that’s the concentration we spray, but that’s not the concentration that human cells are bathing in. Once it gets into drinking water or food, it’s highly diluted.” And, they’re quick to point out, if we look at people with the greatest exposure—pesticide workers—the vast majority of studies show no link between the use of Roundup and cancer or non-cancer diseases. There are a few suggestive findings suggesting a link with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. One study of pesticide applicators suggested an association with multiple myeloma, and one study of the children of pesticide applicators found a tentative association with ADHD, but again these are folks experiencing a much greater exposure level than the general population that may just get a few parts per million in their food. But there had never been any studies done on the tiny levels found circulating in people’s bodies, until now. In a study out of Thailand, the maximum residue levels were set at parts per million (the concentrations found within human bodies is measured in parts per billion). The study found glyphosate can activate estrogen receptors at a few parts per trillion, increasing the growth of estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cells in a petri dish. These results indicate “that truly relevant concentrations of the pesticide found on GMO soybeans possesses estrogenic activity.” But consumption of soy is associated with lower breast cancer risk (See BRCA Breast Cancer Genes and Soy), and improved breast cancer survival (See Breast Cancer Survival and Soy). That may be because most GMO soy in the U.S. is fed to chickens, pigs, and cows as livestock feed, whereas most of the major soy food manufacturers use non-GMO soy. Or it could be because the benefits of eating any kind of soy may far outweigh the risks, but why accept any risk at all when we can choose organic soy products, which by law exclude GMOs. The bottom-line is that there is no direct human data suggesting harm from eating GMOs, though in fairness such studies haven’t been done, which is exactly the point that critics counter. This is why we need mandatory labeling on GMO products so that public health researchers can track whether GMOs are having any adverse effects. It is important to put the GMO issue in perspective though. As I’ve shown (See Lifestyle Medicine: Treating the Causes of Disease), there are dietary and lifestyle changes we can make that could eliminate most heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and cancer. Millions of lives could be saved. A healthy enough diet can even reverse our number one killer, heart disease. So, I’m sympathetic to the biotech industry’s exasperation about GMO concerns when we still have people dropping dead from everything else they’re eating. As one review concluded “consumption of genetically modified food entails risk of undesirable effects… similar to the consumption of traditional food.” In other words, buying the non-GMO Twinkie isn’t doing our body much of a favor.

GMO soy has been found to be contaminated with pesticide residues (see Are GMOs Safe? The Case of Roundup Ready Soy), but are these levels anything to worry about? I explore this question in my video Is Monsanto’s Roundup Pesticide Glyphosate Safe?. Researchers out of Norway described the amount of pesticide residues found in GMO soy as high compared to the maximum allowable residue levels. The legal limit for glyphosate in foods had been set at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg; so, these exceed the legal limits by an average of about 2000%, whereas organic and conventional non-GMO soy both had none. So, what did Monsanto do? Did the industry ditch the whole GMO thing, go back to using fewer pesticides so that residue levels wouldn’t be so high? Or, they could just change the definition of high. What if they could get authorities to raise the maximum residue level from 0.1 or 0.2 up to 20? Then the residue levels won’t look so high anymore. And this is exactly what they did. The acceptance level of glyphosate in food and animal feed has been increased by authorities in countries that use Roundup-Ready GM crops. In Brazil, they went up to ten, and the U.S. and Europe now accept up to 20. In all of these cases, the maximum residue level values appear to have been adjusted, not based on new evidence indicating glyphosate toxicity was less than previously understood, but pragmatically in response to actual observed increases in the content of residues in GMO soybeans—otherwise it wouldn’t be legal to sell the stuff. What evidence do we have, though, that these kinds of residues are harmful? For 12 years, we’ve heard that Roundup interferes with embryonic development, but that study was about sea urchin embryos. For 14 years, we heard that Roundup may disrupt hormones, but that’s in mouse testicles. Blogs will dish about concerning new studies implicating Roundup in male fertility, but if we look at the study, it’s about rat testicles. Some blogs cite studies with disturbing titles like “prepubertal exposure alters testosterone levels and testicular shape,” but they’re talking about puberty in rats, though that doesn’t make as catchy a blog title. Why not use human tissue? Women are having babies every day—why not just experiment on human placentas, which would otherwise just get thrown away? In 2005, researchers did just that. And despite all the negative effects in rodents, glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup didn’t seem to have much of a toxic effect on human cells even at high doses, or have much effect on a hormone regulating enzyme, leading Monsanto-funded reviewers to conclude that regardless of what hazards might be alleged based on animal studies, “glyphosate is not anticipated to produce adverse developmental and reproductive effects in humans.” But pure glyphosate isn’t sprayed on crops, Roundup is, which contains a variety of adjuvants and surfactants meant to help the glyphosate penetrate into tissues. And indeed, when the study was repeated with what’s actually sprayed on GMO crops, there were toxic and hormonal effects even at doses smaller than the 1 or 2% concentration that’s used out on the fields. Similar results were found for other major pesticides. It took until 2014, but eight out of nine pesticide formulations tested were up to one thousand times more toxic than their so-called active ingredients. So, when we just test the isolated chemicals, we may not get the whole story. Roundup was found to be 100 times more toxic than glyphosate itself. Moreover, Roundup turned out to be among the most toxic pesticides they tested. It’s commonly believed that Roundup is among the safest, though, an idea spread by Monsanto, the manufacturer. However, this inconsistency between scientific fact and industrial claim may be attributed to the huge economic interests involved. What is glyphosate? Check out: Are GMOs Safe? The Case of BT Corn. It’s the dose that makes the poison, though. Do we have evidence that the levels of Roundup chemicals not only found on crops, but also in our bodies after eating those crops actually have adverse effects? That’s the subject of the video: GMO Soy and Breast Cancer. Commercial interests can have a corrupting effect on the science of nutrition and hold sway over institutions that are supposed to operate in the public interest.

A-70	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/07/05/gmos-safe-case-roundup-ready-soy/	GMO Soybeans Compared to Conventionally Grown & Organic Soy	As I discussed in the video, Are GMOs Safe? The Case of BT Corn, genes from GMO crops were found in pregnant women. There is debate on the direct threat of the inserted genes, but the real danger may come from pesticides associated with genetically modified foods. As stated in an article published in Science and Engineering Ethics, “genetically engineered seed biotechnology typically has not been used to increase crop yields, nutrition, or drought tolerance but instead for profitable pesticide-resistant products… 80% of GMO crops are bioengineered only for pesticide resistance. Not surprising, given that the top five biotech companies are chemical companies that manufacture pesticides.” This allows farmers to spray herbicides directly onto the crops, raising a theoretical possibility that the levels of herbicide residues on food we buy at the supermarket may have increased. Or at least it was theoretical… until now. Monsanto’s roundup-ready soybeans are the number one GM crop, genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide, Roundup—also sold by Monsanto. This allows farmers to spray fields with the Roundup herbicide glyphosate, which then kills the weeds while leaving the soy standing. Monsanto maintains that roundup ready soybeans are compositionally equivalent to that of conventional soy, a concept that is used to argue that GMO foods are therefore as safe as non-GMO. Monsanto did not report the level of pesticide residues, however. In fact, some of the comparison tests were done on Roundup-ready soybeans that hadn’t been sprayed at all, which is the whole point of having Roundup-ready plants. In contrast to real-life samples from the market, transgenic crops intended for scientific studies are often produced without the application of herbicides or at doses lower than those typically used by farmers. It wasn’t until a study published in 2014 when the full composition of ready-to-market soybeans was analyzed. You can see the analysis in my video, Are GMOs Safe? The Case of Roundup Ready Soy. There was a significant amount of glyphosate found in the GMO beans, along with a glyphosate breakdown product called AMPA. There was no glyphosate or AMPA found in organic soy. What about conventional non-GMO soy where glyphosate is just sprayed on the soil to kill weeds between crop cycles? Also none. So, GMO soybeans are really not equivalent; they appear to have substantially more pesticide residues. The debate then shifts from the safety of Roundup ready soybeans, to the safety of Roundup itself. I discuss whether or not the glyphosate residues on GMO soy are something to be concerned about in my video Is Monsanto’s Roundup Pesticide Glyphosate Safe? More on GMO soy can be found in my video GMO Soy and Breast Cancer. What can happen when food industries self-regulate?

When I set out to write How Not to Die I wanted to create more than just a reference book. Yes, I tried to pull together all of the most compelling evidence on the role diet can play in preventing and reversing disease, but I also sought to make it a practical guide for translating those thousands of studies into an actionable guide to day-to-day healthy living. That became the second half of the book, in which I centered my recommendations around a daily dozen checklist of foods I try to fit into my own daily routine. The response to the Daily Dozen has been tremendous! While I offered some thoughts on ways to incorporate things like turmeric or flax seeds into your diet, we’ve been getting flooded with requests for more recipes. The science is there, but how can you make anything taste good without adding salt, oil, or sugar? So I’m excited to announce my plans for a companion How Not to Die Cookbook (all my proceeds, as always, go to charity). The bad news: Given all the recipe testing and food photography, it’s not going to be out until December 2017, more than a year away. But in the meantime, there is great news: a new tech startup called Lighter has created meal plans based on recipes they developed to fit my specifications  Sign up for free at http://www.lighter.world/providers/Michael_Greger You can also follow the culinary stylings of other leaders in the evidence-based nutrition movement like Dr. Neal Barnard and Julieanna Hever (or anyone from ultramarathoners to NFL athletes). I was honored to be among the first invited to aid in furthering their mission to help the world eat better. “Everyone,” reads one of their mottos, “deserves nourishing, delicious meals.” Vegworld Magazine, run by the Texas power duo featured in the documentary The Marshall Plan, has generously offered free one-year subscriptions to all NutritionFacts.org subscribers.   If you subscribe to NutritionFacts.org, sign up for your free one-year subscription to the magazine here.

A-72	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/28/gmos-safe-case-bt-corn/	Is Insecticidal GMO Corn Safe?	Recently, the prominent science journal Nature editorialized that we are now swimming in information about genetically modified crops, but that much of the information is wrong—on both sides of the debate. “But a lot of this incorrect information is sophisticated, backed by legitimate-sounding research and written with certitude,” adding that with GMOs, “a good gauge of a statement’s fallacy is the conviction with which it is delivered.” To many in the scientific community, GMO concerns are dismissed as one big conspiracy theory. In fact, one item in a psychological test of belief in conspiracy theories asked people if they thought food companies would have the audacity to be dishonest about genetically modified food. The study concluded that many people were cynical and skeptical with regard to advertising tricks, as well as the tactics of organizations like banks and alcohol, drug, and tobacco companies. That doesn’t sound like conspiracy theory to me; that sounds like business as usual. We must remember there is a long legacy of scientific misconduct. Throw in a multi-billion dollar industry, and one can imagine how hard it is to get to the truth of the matter. There are social, environmental, economic, food security, and biodiversity arguments both pro and con about GMOs, but those are outside my area of expertise. I’m going to stick to food safety. And as a physician, I’m a very limited veterinarian—I only know one species (us!). So, I will skip the lab animal data and ask instead: What human data do we have about GMO safety? One study “confirmed” that DNA from genetically modified crops can be transferred into humans who eat them, but that’s not what the study found, just that plant DNA in general may be found in the human bloodstream, with no stipulations of harm (See Are GMOs Safe? The Case of Bt Corn). Another study, however, did find a GMO crop protein in people. The “toxin” was detected in 93 percent of blood samples of pregnant women, 80 percent of umbilical cord blood samples, and 69 percent of samples from non-pregnant women. The toxin they’re talking about is an insecticidal protein produced by Bt bacteria whose gene was inserted into the corn’s DNA to create so-called Bt-corn, which has been incorporated into animal feed. If it’s mainly in animal feed, how did it get into the bodies of women? They suggest it may be through exposure to contaminated meat. Of course, why get GMO’s second-hand when you can get them directly? The next great frontier is transgenic farm animals. A genetically modified salmon was first to vie for a spot at the dinner table. And then in 2010, transgenic cows, sheep, goats and pigs were created, genetically modified for increased muscle mass, based on the so-called mighty mouse model. Frankenfurters! But back to children of the corn and their mothers. When they say it’s a toxin, it’s a toxin to corn worms, not necessarily to people. In fact I couldn’t find any data linking BT toxin to human harm, which is a good thing since it’s considered one of the few pesticides considered so non-toxic that it’s sprayed on organic fruits and vegetables. For more on on the public health implications of genetically modified crops, see: I did a similar “controversial issue” video series on gluten.

A-73	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/23/latest-antibiotics-agribusiness/	Why Does the Meat Industry Routinely Feed Animals Antibiotics?	When farm animals are fed antibiotics, they can develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their guts. Manure contamination of meat can then transfer these gut bacteria to humans. These bacteria can even spread to vegetarians, since drug-resistant bacteria in the animal feces can also spread to people through crops or the environment. Exhaust fans can blow MRSA superbugs straight out into the surrounding area from pig or poultry operations. This may explain why human MRSA infections in Europe have been tied to just living in a region with industrial pig production, whether or not people have direct contact with livestock. These findings may not just be limited to Europe. European factory farms pale in comparison to what we have here in the U.S. From an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association’s Internal Medicine: “proximity to swine manure application to crop fields and livestock operations was each associated with MRSA and skin and soft-tissue infections [in people in the U.S]. These findings contribute to the growing concern about the potential public health impacts of high-density livestock production.” An article published in Lancet Infectious Diseases explains that, “achievements in modern medicine, such as surgery, the treatment of preterm babies, and cancer chemotherapy, which we today take for granted, would not be possible without access to effective treatment for bacterial infections. Within just a few years, we might be faced with dire setbacks, medically, socially, and economically, unless real and unprecedented global coordinated actions are immediately taken” to protect these wonder drugs. Therefore, the use of antibiotics just to promote the growth of farm animals to slaughter weights should be banned worldwide. Europe stopped feeding pigs and chickens tetracycline and penicillin to promote growth about 40 years ago, something the U.S. meat industry continues to do to this day. The Pew Commission recently published a five year update on their landmark blue ribbon commission report on current agricultural practices that found “the present system of producing food animals in the United States presents an unacceptable level of risk to public health.” Their number one recommendation was to ban the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics, but agriculture lobbies are not going to give up the use of antibiotics without a fight (See Antibiotics: Agribusinesses’ Pound of Flesh). In December 2013, the FDA released “Guidance for Industry,” their voluntary, non-binding recommendation for industry. They recommend antibiotics no longer be used to just fatten animals for slaughter, but emphasize that they are just that: toothless, non-legally enforceable suggestions. As mentioned in the Pew Commission report, “this voluntary approach has come under withering criticism from the public health and medical communities concerned about the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.” The USDA is even considering going backwards, eliminating the requirement to even test for Staph aureus at all in the Federal School Lunch Program. They understand that “school-aged children are considered a ‘sensitive population’, hence, more stringent requirements, including sampling plans, may be considered to help assure safety and public confidence. However, the cost of such programs must be weighed against the cost of buying the food needed to support the program.” As one University of Iowa epidemiologist said, “although human health should take priority over farm animals, farmers will be reluctant to change until researchers can come up with safe and cost-effective practices to replace the use of antibiotics.” How much are antibiotics really saving the industry? The net bottom-line benefit from the use of antibiotic feed additives may only be about $0.25 per animal, which means eliminating the risky practice of feeding antibiotics by the ton to farm animals would raise the price of meat less than a penny per pound. For those not familiar with MRSA, please see my past videos on the topic: For more on antibiotic use on the farm, see: 	-	antibiotics,chicken,cost savings,Europe,factory farming practices,farm animals,FDA,fecal contamination,feed additives,industry influence,meat,MRSA,penicillin,Pew Commission,poultry,staph infection,turkey,USDA,vegans,vegetarians	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibiotics-agribusinesses-pound-of-flesh/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23462092,http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-a-livable-future/research/clf_publications/pub_rep_desc/pew_report.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043228,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685139,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antibiotics-agribusinesses-pound-of-flesh/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810935/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24252483,http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM299624.pdf,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713501000780,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887415	
A-74	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/21/time-hospitals-stop-selling-sickness/	Fast Food Restaurants in Children's Hospitals	The food industry spends billions on advertising. Promotion costs for individual candy bars can run in the tens of millions. McDonald’s alone spends a billion dollars on advertising every year. Such figures dwarf the National Cancer Institute’s million dollar annual investment promoting fruit and vegetable consumption or the 1.5 million spent on cholesterol education. That McBillion goes a long way. Children’s food preferences are being molded by McDonald’s even before they learn to tie their shoelaces. By the early age of three to five years, preschoolers preferred the taste of foods and drinks if they thought they were from McDonald’s. This was true even for carrots—baby carrots placed in a bag with the McDonald’s logo reportedly tasted better. And if they get sick, children can continue to eat McDonald’s in the hospital. Nearly 1 in 3 children’s hospitals have a fast food restaurant inside, leading parents to have more positive perceptions of the healthiness of McDonald’s food (See Hospitals Selling Sickness). They can also just buy the naming rights altogether: The Ronald McDonald Children’s Hospital, for example. In teaching hospitals, though, Krispy Kreme tops the list. Hospitals may wish to revisit the idea of serving high-calorie fast food in the very place where they also care for the most seriously ill. This is reminiscent of the fight against tobacco back in the 1980’s when public health advocates made radical suggestions, such as not selling cigarettes in hospitals. By working to make our hospitals ultimately smoke-free, we become part of a global campaign to completely eliminate the tobacco scourge. The task is difficult, but so was eradicating smallpox. Maybe it’s time to stop selling sickness in hospitals. For more on health entities appeasing the junk food industry, see my video Collaboration With the New Vectors of Disease. Even the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the registered dietitian organization, has quite the shady history which I document near the end of my 2014 annual review presentation From Table to Able.

A-75	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/16/dietary-estrogens-male-fertility/	Dietary Estrogens & Male Fertility	In my video, The Role of Diet in Declining Sperm Counts, I discussed the association between high saturated fat intake and reduced semen quality. But what’s the connection? One of the most recent papers on the topic found that a significant percentage of the saturated fat intake in the study was derived from dairy products. Residues of industrial chemicals may bioaccumulate up the food chain into animal fat, and some of these lipophilic (fat-loving) chemicals may have hormone-disrupting abilities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency performed a national survey of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic pollutants in the U.S. milk supply (highlighted in my video, Dairy Estrogen and Male Fertility). The EPA team noted that since milk fat is likely to be among the highest dietary sources of exposure to these pollutants, it’s important to understand the levels in the dairy supply. The team tested milk from all over the country and found a veritable witches brew of chemicals. They estimate that dairy products alone contribute about 30% to 50% of our dioxin exposure. And “like dioxin, other toxic pollutants tend to be widely dispersed in the environment, bioaccumulated through the food chain and ultimately result in low-level contamination in most animal fats.” This may explain higher pollutant concentrations in fish eaters. Xenoestrogens like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with the fats of fish or animal flesh and cannot be fully removed by washing and cooking, and so can accumulate in our fat, too. Xenoestrogens are chemicals with demasculinizing or feminizing effects. But even in a non-polluted world, animal foods also have actual estrogens, which are unavoidable constituents of animal products. All foodstuff of animal origin contains estradiol, which is at least 10,000-fold more potent than most xenoestrogens. Dietary exposure—meat, dairy products and eggs—to these natural sex steroids is therefore highly relevant, as the hormones in these animals are identical to our own. Estrogens are present in meat and eggs, but the major sources are milk and other dairy products. By drinking a glass of milk, a child’s intake of estradiol is 4,000 times the intake of xenoestrogens in terms of hormone activity. Modern genetically-improved dairy cows can lactate throughout their pregnancy. The problem is that during pregnancy, estrogen levels can jump as much as 30-fold. Cheese intake has specifically been associated with lower sperm concentration, whereas dairy food intake in general has been associated with abnormal sperm shape and movement. Lower sperm concentrations by themselves may just represent a potential suppression of sperm production due to higher estrogen levels, but abnormal shape and movement suggests that dairy intake may be implicated in actual direct testicular damage. While milk products supply most of our ingested female sex steroids, eggs are a considerable source as well, contributing about as much as meat and fish. This could be expected, as eggs are produced directly in the hens’ ovaries. Meat may also contain added hormones. In the U.S., anabolic sex steroids may be administered to animals for growth promotion, a practice banned in Europe twenty-five years ago. A study in New York found progressively lower sperm counts associated with processed meat consumption. However, similar studies in Europe after the ban found the same thing; so, it may not be the implanted hormones, but rather a consequence of other meat components, such as the saturated fat raising cholesterol levels. We’ve known for decades that men with high cholesterol levels show abnormalities in their “spermiograms”: decreased sperm concentration, about a third of the normal sperm movement, and half the normal sperm shape. Twenty-five years later, we’re finding the same thing. In the largest study to date, higher blood cholesterol levels were associated with a significantly lower percentage of normal sperm. Cholesterol was also associated with reductions in semen volume and live sperm count. These results highlight the role of fats in the blood in male fertility, and should be of concern given the rising prevalence of obesity and cholesterol problems. Although a healthier diet may be associated with healthier sperm counts, cholesterol-lowering statin drugs do not seem to help. What about the phytoestrogens in soy? See The Effect of Soy on Precocious Puberty. More on hormones in dairy in: Neurotoxic chemicals in the dairy supply have been blamed for neurological conditions as well.

A-76	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/14/role-diet-declining-sperm-counts/	Preserving Male Reproductive Health With Diet	In 1992, a controversial paper was published suggesting sperm counts have been dropping around the world over the last 50 years. However, this remains a matter of debate. It’s notoriously difficult to determine sperm counts in the general population for obvious reasons. If you just go ask men for samples, less than 1 in 3 tend to agree to participate. Finally though, a study of tens of thousands of men studied over a 17-year period was published. It indeed found a significant decline in sperm concentration, about a 30 percent drop, as well as a drop in the percentage of normal looking sperms. Most sperms looked normal in the 90’s, but more recently that has dropped to less than half. This may constitute a serious public health warning. Semen quality may actually be related to life expectancy. In a study of more than 40,000 men visiting a sperm lab during a 40-year period, they found a decrease in mortality was associated with an increase in semen quality, suggesting that semen quality may therefore be a fundamental biomarker of overall male health. Even when defective sperm are capable of fertilizing an egg, creating a child with abnormal sperm may have serious implications for that child’s future health. What role may diet play? I profiled a first-of-its-kind Harvard study suggesting that a small increase in saturated fat intake was associated with a substantially lower sperm count, but not all fat was bad. Higher intakes of omega-3’s were associated with a more favorable sperm shape. This may help explain why researchers at UCLA were able to improve sperm vitality, movement, and shape by giving men about 18 walnuts a day for 12 weeks. Walnuts have more than just omega 3’s, though. They also contain other important micronutrients. In a study of men aged 22 through 80, older men who ate diets containing lots of antioxidants and nutrients, such as vitamin C, had the genetic integrity of sperm of much younger men. The antioxidants we eat not only end up in our semen, but are concentrated there. The amount of vitamin C ends up nearly ten times more concentrated in men’s testicles than the rest of their bodies. Why? Because sperm are highly susceptible to damage induced by free radicals, and accumulating evidence suggests that this oxidative stress plays an important role in male infertility. So, more fruits and vegetables and perhaps less meat and dairy, but the Harvard data were considered preliminary. They studied fewer than 100 men, but it was the best we had… until now. A much larger follow-up study, highlighted in my video, The Role of Diet in Declining Sperm Counts, found that the higher the saturated fat intake the lower the sperm count, up to a 65 percent reduction. These findings are of potentially great public interest because changes in diet over the past decades may be part of the explanation for the recently reported high frequency of subnormal human sperm counts. In any case, the current findings suggest that adapting dietary intake toward eating less saturated fat may be beneficial for both general and reproductive health. Why is high dietary intake of saturated fat associated with reduced semen quality? What’s the connection? Sex steroid hormones in meat, eggs, and dairy may help explain the link between saturated fat intake and declining sperm counts. That’s the subject of my video, Dairy Estrogen and Male Fertility. More on male infertility in my videos Fukushima and Radioactivity in Seafood and Male Fertility and Diet.

A-77	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/09/juicing-removes-just-fiber/	Why Smoothies are Better Than Juicing	Studies such as a recent Harvard School of Public Health investigation found that the consumption of whole fruits is associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas fruit juice consumption is associated with a higher risk, highlighting the dramatic difference between eating whole fruits and drinking fruit juice. Cholesterol serves as another example. If we eat apples, our cholesterol drops. On the other hand, if we drink apple juice, our cholesterol may actually go up a little. Leaving just a little of the fiber behind—as in cloudy apple juice—was found to add back in some of the benefit. We used to think of fiber as just a bulking agent that helps with bowel regularity. We now know fiber is digestible by our gut bacteria, which make short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) out of it. SCFAs have a number of health promoting effects, such as inhibiting the growth of bad bacteria and increasing mineral absorption. For example, experimentally infused into the rectum of the human body, SCFAs can stimulate calcium absorption, so much so that we can improve the bone mineral density of teenagers just by giving them the fiber naturally found in foods like onions, asparagus, and bananas. Our good bacteria also use fiber to maintain normal bowel structure and function, preventing or alleviating diarrhea, stimulating colonic blood flow up to five-fold, and increasing fluid and electrolyte uptake. The major fuel for the cells that line our colon is butyrate, which our good bacteria make from fiber. We feed them, and they feed us right back. If the only difference between fruit and fruit juice is fiber, why can’t the juice industry just add some fiber back to the juice? The reason is because we remove a lot more than fiber when we juice fruits and vegetables. We also lose all the nutrients that are bound to the fiber. In the 1980’s, a study (highlighted in my video, Juicing Removes More Than Just Fiber) found a discrepancy in the amount of fiber in carob using two different methods. A gap of 21.5 percent was identified not as fiber but as nonextractable polyphenols, a class of phytonutrients thought to have an array of health-promoting effects. Some of the effects associated with the intake of dietary fiber in plants may actually be due to the presence of these polyphenols. Nonextractable polyphenols, usually ignored, are the major part of dietary polyphenols. Most polyphenol phytonutrients in plants are stuck to the fiber. These so-called missing polyphenols make it down to our colon, are liberated by our friendly flora and can then get absorbed into our system. The phytonutrients in fruit and vegetable juice may just be the tip of the iceberg. For those that like drinking their fruits and vegetables, these findings suggest that smoothies may be preferable. I can imagine people who eat really healthy thinking they get so much fiber from their regular diet that they need not concern themselves with the loss from juicing. But we may be losing more than we think. Why are polyphenol phytonutrients important? See, for example, my video How to Slow Brain Aging by Two Years Not that fiber isn’t important in its own right.

A-78	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/07/virus-in-chicken-could-be-linked-to-obesity/	Virus in Chicken Could Be Linked to Obesity	Recently, there has been research examining the connection between poultry consumption and weight gain. One study out of the Netherlands examining about 4,000 people, correlated chicken consumption with weight gain. Another study followed 89,000 people in four other countries and found that animal protein intake was associated with long-term weight gain, and poultry was the worst, with 40 percent more weight gain than red meat or processed meat. What makes poultry so bad? Yes, chickens are fatty these days because of the way we’ve genetically manipulated them—up to ten times more fat and calories than they used to have—but one bizarre theory postulated that it might be due to an obesity-causing chicken virus. In one study, one in five obese humans tested positive to the chicken virus SMAM-1, with those exposed to the chicken virus averaging 33 pounds heavier than those testing negative. SMAM-1 was the first chicken virus to be associated with human obesity, but not the last. The original obesity-causing chicken virus SMAM-1 was able to effectively transmit obesity from one chicken to another when caged together, similar to a human adenovirus Ad-36, a human obesity-associated virus first associated with obesity in chickens and mice. Ad-36 spreads quickly from one chicken to another via nasal, oral or fecal excretion and contamination, causing obesity in each chicken. This, of course, raises serious concerns about Ad-36-induced adiposity in humans. The easiest way to test this hypothesis is to experimentally infect humans with the virus. However, ethical reasons preclude experimental infection of humans, and so, the evidence will have to remain indirect. In the absence of direct experimental data, we must rely on population studies, similar to how researchers nailed smoking and lung cancer. About 15 percent of Americans are already infected with Ad-36; so, we can follow them and see what happens. That’s exactly what a research team out of Taiwan did (highlighted in my video Infectobesity: Adenovirus 36 and Childhood Obesity). They followed 1,400 Hispanic men and women for a decade and found that not only were those exposed to the virus fatter than those who were not, but also over the ten years, those with a history of infection had a greater percentage of body fat over time. Most studies done to date on adults have found a connection between exposure to Ad-36 and obesity, and all studies done so far on childhood obesity show an increase in prevalence of infection in obese children compared to non-obese children. We’re now up to more than a thousand children studied with similar findings. Obese children who tested positive for the virus weighed 35 pounds more than children who tested negative. The virus appears to both increase the number of fat cells by mobilizing precursor stem cells and increase the accumulation of fat within the cells. If we take liposuction samples of fat from people, the fat cell precursors turn into fat cells at about five times the rate in people who came to the liposuction clinic already infected. Fat taken from non-infected people that was then exposed to the virus start sucking up fat at a faster rate, potentially inducing obesity without increasing food intake. Just as Ad-36 can be transmitted horizontally from one infected chicken to another in the same cage, subsequently causing obesity in each chicken, this same virus is also easily transmitted among humans, raising the question as to whether at least some cases of childhood obesity can be considered an infectious disease. Researchers publishing in the International Journal of Pediatric Obesity speculate that this animal adenovirus may have mutated to become a human adenovirus capable of infecting humans and causing obesity. Other unconventional theories about obesity are explored in my videos Obesity-Causing Pollutants in Food and Gut Flora & Obesity.

The last time I covered this controversial topic was 4 years ago, during which time 15,950 scientific papers on the topic were published. Having an influential vitamin D supplement lobby doesn’t help matters, not to mention the highly lucrative vitamin D lab testing industry. Then there’s the sunscreen trade, the dermatologist faction, and a multi-billion dollar tanning industry. Did you know there are more tanning salons than Starbucks? With so many powerful commercial interests trying to manipulate the message, it can be hard to get at the truth. But that’s what you have me for! Stay tuned: I also have new videos queued up over the next few months on turmeric, protein, Parkinson’s disease, osteoporosis, meat hormones, and natural treatments for morning sickness. If you don’t want to wait, all of these videos are available now as a digital download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 31 (all proceeds go to charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD. The current batch of videos from volume 30 are about to run out on NutritionFacts.org. So, starting next month and running until August, I’ll roll out the videos from this new DVD, volume 31. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works—50+ hours of video—you can get the complete DVD collection. Here’s the full list of chapters from the new volume 31 DVD—a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org: Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads. If you were a regular supporter, you’d already be a vitamin D expert by now, having already received the new DVD. I come out with new DVDs every 9 weeks. If you’d like to automatically receive them before they’re even available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor. Anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both—your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs. If you’re already signed up and didn’t receive your volume 31 yet, please email DVDhelp@NutritionFacts.org and we’ll make everything all better. If you’d rather just watch all the videos online as they launch, but would still like to support my work of helping to educate millions about healthy eating, you can make a tax-deductible donation to my 501c3 nonprofit organization NutritionFacts.org using a credit card, Bitcoin, a direct PayPal link, or by sending a check to “NutritionFacts.org” PO Box 11400, Takoma Park, MD 20913.

Most of the work on NutritionFacts.org gets done by volunteers. One major project has been to translate videos into other languages. We have more than 80 volunteer translators translating into more than 30 languages! The first video in the last batch had 27 translations the day it went live. But how can you tell which videos are in which languages? Our new search function! Thanks to Christi, our rockstar web developer and CTO, the search function on NutritionFacts.org has been totally revamped. Click on the search box and you can now sort and filter results by title, date, type and language. Want to know which videos are available in Spanish, Hebrew or Chinese? Now you can! What we need now are more translators. If you know another language please consider chipping in and translating some of your favorite videos to help save lives around the world. Sign up at http://nutritionfacts.org/volunteer You’ll note we’re still in desperate need of volunteer article retrievers as well. If you’re a student or faculty at an institution that grants you academic journal access, please consider helping us sift through the scientific literature. Please note it may take a few weeks for our hopefully-soon-to-be-hired Volunteer Director to get back to you, but please consider signing up today to help translate or sift so she or he can hit the ground running. Over the years, people have recorded my live presentations with their phones and camcorders, but they’ve never really been captured professionally… until now! Thanks to Viva and the College of Naturopathic Medicine, on my recent trip to London my new How Not to Die talk was recorded and edited by a videography team and it’s available free at http://bit.ly/londontalk. It’s similar to the talk I gave at Google but modified for a UK audience. The British suffer from the same leading causes of death, just in a slightly different order. Dr. John McDougall has graciously offered to allow me to post a U.S. version recorded at his Advanced Study Weekend. As soon as we get our Social Media Director on board to do its promotion justice, I will post it. Until then, I think the London recording is the best capture of my most powerful presentation to date. I hope you’ll help me share it with the world. Thanks to the volunteer efforts of John Slavick, a major update has been made to the Android version of my Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen app. Now you can track, graph, and chart your progress over time—how cool is that? Wish the iPhone version were that awesome too? If you’re an app developer we need your help!

A-80	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/31/treating-pancreatic-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/	Treating Pancreatic Cancer with Turmeric Curcumin	Pancreatic cancer is among the most aggressive forms of human cancer, characterized by a very high mortality rate. It represents the fourth leading cause of cancer death in United States, killing 32,000 people annually. With a five-year survival rate of only three percent and a median survival rate of less than six months, pancreatic cancer carries one of the poorest prognoses. The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is one of the worst things a doctor ever has to tell a patient. The only FDA-approved therapies for it, Gemcitabine and Erlotinib, produce objective responses in less than ten percent of patients, while causing severe side-effects in the majority. There is a desperate need for new options. Clinical research to test new treatments is split into phases. Phase I trials are just to make sure the treatment is safe, to see how much you can give before it becomes toxic. Curcumin, the natural yellow pigment in the spice turmeric has passed a number of those. In fact, there was so little toxicity, the dosing appeared limited only by the number of pills patients were willing to swallow. Phase II trials are conducted to see if the drug actually has an effect. Curcumin did, in 2 of the 21 patients that were evaluated. One patient had a 73 percent tumor reduction, but the effect was short-lived. One lesion remained small, but a curcumin-resistant tumor clone emerged. The other patient, who had a stable disease for over 18 months, showed slow improvement over a year. The only time that patient’s cancer markers bumped up was during a brief three-week stint where the curcumin was stopped. So, curcumin does seem to help some patients with pancreatic cancer, and most importantly, there appears to be little downside. No curcumin-related toxic effects were observed in up to doses of eight grams per day. What happens after eight grams? We don’t know because no one was willing to take that many pills. The patients were willing to go on one of the nastiest chemotherapy regimens on the planet, but didn’t want to be inconvenienced with swallowing a lot of capsules. The only surefire way to beat pancreatic cancer is to prevent it in the first place. In 2010, I profiled a study conducted by the National Institutes of Health, the largest such study in history, which found that dietary fat of animal origin was associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk. Which animal fat is the worst? The second largest study (highlighted in my video: Turmeric Curcumin and Pancreatic Cancer) has since chimed in to help answer that question. Researchers found that poultry was the worst, with 72 percent increased risk of pancreatic cancer associated with every 50 grams of daily poultry consumption. Fifty grams is just about a quarter of a chicken breast. The reason white meat came out worse than red may be because of the cooked meat carcinogens in chicken, the heterocyclic amines that build up in grilled and baked chicken. These mutagenic chemicals have been associated with a doubling of pancreatic cancer risk (See Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens). Meat has been associated with significantly increased risk, whereas fake meat is associated with significantly less risk. Those who eat plant-based meats like veggie burgers or veggie dogs three or more times a week had less than half the risk of fatal pancreatic cancer. Legumes and dried fruit appear to be similarly protective. My grandfather died of pancreatic cancer. By the time the first symptom arose, a dull ache in his gut, it was too late. That’s why we need to work on preventing it. I previously touched on pancreatic cancer prevention in Poultry Exposure Tied to Liver and Pancreatic Cancer and attempts at pancreatic cancer treatment in Gerson Therapy for Cancer and Gerson-style Therapy vs. Chemotherapy.

A-81	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/26/preventing-breast-cancer-with-flax-seeds/	Preventing Breast Cancer with Flax Seeds	I’ve previously discussed the role of dietary lignans in the reduction of breast cancer risk and improvement in breast cancer survival, based on studies that showed that women with breast cancer who ate the most lignans appeared to live longer (Flaxseeds & Breast Cancer Survival: Epidemiological Evidence and Flaxseeds & Breast Cancer Survival: Clinical Evidence). However, lignans are found throughout the plant kingdom—in seeds, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, berries—so, how do we know lignans aren’t merely a marker for the intake of unrefined plant foods? For example, those who eat lots of plants—vegetarians—have about eight times the lignan intake compared to omnivores. In a petri dish, lignans have been shown to both have direct anticancer growth activity against human breast cancer cells and to prevent cancer cell migration. But it wasn’t until 2005 that it was put to the test in people. Researchers from the University of Toronto conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial (as seen in my video, Can Flax Seeds Help Prevent Breast Cancer?) of flaxseeds, the world’s most concentrated source of lignans, in breast cancer patients. The researchers found that flax appears to have the potential to reduce human breast tumor growth in just a matter of weeks. Therefore, I started recommending ground flax seeds to breast cancer patients. Can lignans also help prevent breast cancer in the first place? High lignan intake is associated with reduced breast cancer risk, but again lignan intake may just be saying an indicator of high plant food intake in general. So, researchers from the University of Kansas gave women at high risk for breast cancer a teaspoon of ground flaxseeds a day for a year, and found on average a drop in precancerous changes in the breast. What about women who regularly eat flax seeds? Outside of an experimental setting, there just weren’t a lot of women eating flax seeds regularly to study—until now. Matching 3,000 women with breast cancer to 3,000 women without, a study published in Cancer Causes and Control found that consumption of flaxseed (and of flax bread) was associated with a 20–30 percent reduction in breast cancer risk. The researchers note that, as flaxseeds are packed with lignans, only a small daily serving of flaxseed is required to attain the level of lignan intake associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk. Researchers concluded: “As it appears that most women do not consume flaxseed and that small amounts may be associated with reduced breast cancer risk, interventions to increase the prevalence of flaxseed consumption might be considered.” The latest review summarizes the association between flax and decreased risk of breast cancer, better mental health, and lower mortality among breast cancer patients. The only other study of flax and brain health I’m aware of was an exploration of 100 commonly used drugs and supplements on cognition in older adults, which found that flax is one of the few things that appears to help. How else may flaxseeds aid in preventing and treating breast cancer? There’s an inflammatory molecule called interleukin-1, which may help tumors feed, grow, and invade. Our bodies therefore produce an interkeukin-1 receptor antagonist, binding to the IL-1 receptor and blocking the action of IL-1. The activity of this protective inhibitor can be boosted with the drug tamoxifen—or by eating flax seed. In premenopausal women, the proinflammatory profile of interleukin-1 can be counteracted by a dietary addition of a few spoonfuls of ground flax. One month of flax may be able to increase the anti-inflammatory inhibitor levels by over 50 percent, better even than the drug. Yes, having one’s ovaries removed may reduce breast cancer risk as much as 60 percent, but at the cost of severe side effects. The drug tamoxifen may reduce the incidence of breast cancer by more than 40 percent, but may induce other severe side effects such as uterine cancer and blood clots. That’s why less toxic (even safe!) breast cancer preventive strategies, such as dietary modifications, need to be developed. These lignan phytoestrogens in flaxseeds may be one successful route given the data showing reduced breast cancer risk and improved overall survival. Lignans are not a magic bullet to prevent breast cancer—we can’t just sprinkle some flax on our bacon cheeseburger—but as a part of a healthy diet and life-style, they might help to reduce breast cancer risk in the general population. Flaxseeds may also help fight hormone-mediated cancers in men. See Flaxseed vs. Prostate Cancer and Was It the Flaxseed, Fat Restriction, or Both? What else can these puppies do?

A-82	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/24/childrens-supplements-found-contaminated-with-pollutants/	Children’s Supplements Found Contaminated With Pollutants	A number of case-control studies have found that giving kids cod liver oil supplements may increase their risk of asthma later in life. Case-control studies are done by asking about past behavior in cases (those with asthma) versus controls (those without asthma) to see if certain past behaviors are more likely among the disease group. The problem is that asking people to remember what they were doing years ago, when most people can’t remember what they had for breakfast last week, is unreliable. When interpreting the results from case-control studies, we also can’t rule out something called reverse causation. Maybe cod liver oil doesn’t lead to asthma, but asthma led to the use of cod liver oil. It would therefore be nice to see a cohort study. In a cohort study, researchers would take people without asthma and follow them over time to see if those taking cod liver oil are more likely to develop it. Because people without the disease and their diets are followed over time, cohort studies bypass the problems of recall bias and reverse causation. In 2013, we finally got one such study. 17,000 people free of asthma were followed over 11 years. Researchers knew who was taking cod liver oil and who wasn’t, and then sat back and watched to see who got asthma over the subsequent 11 years. The researchers  found that cod liver oil intake was indeed significantly associated with the development of asthma. They thought it might be the excessive vitamin A in the cod liver oil that was causing the problem, but there are also a number of substances in fish oil we may not want our children exposed to. Researchers from Philadelphia University, highlighted in my video PCBs in Children’s Fish Oil Supplements, recently looked at 13 over-the-counter children’s dietary supplements containing fish oil to assess potential exposure to PCBs, toxic industrial pollutants that have contaminated our oceans. PCBs were detected in all products. Could we just stick to the supplements made from small, short-lived fish like anchovies instead of big predator fish like tuna to reduce the impact of biomagnification? Or use purified fish oils?  No, the researchers found no significant difference in PCB levels whether the supplements were labeled as molecularly distilled or how high up the food chain the fish were. The researchers concluded that while children’s dietary supplements containing the long-chain omega-3’s from fish oils may claim to benefit young consumers, “daily ingestion of these products may provide a vector for contaminant exposure that may off-set the positive health effects.” What positive health benefits are they talking about? Researchers publishing in the journal, Early Human Development, found that infants given DHA-fortified formula may have better development of their eyes and brains compared to infants getting non DHA-fortified formula. What was the source of the DHA? Not fish, but algae-derived DHA. In that way, we can get the benefits of omega 3’s without the contaminant risks. But of course, breast milk is the gold standard, significantly better than either of the formula fed infants. So, the best source of omega-3’s is mom. It’s bad enough when supplement manufacturers exploit adults when they’re sick and vulnerable with pills that are often useless or worse, but taking advantage of our parental drive to do what’s best for our children, with contaminated products that may make them sick, makes me sick.

A-83	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/19/no-more-than-a-quart-a-day-of-hibiscus-tea/	No More Than a Quart a Day of Hibiscus Tea	Over the counter antacids are probably the most important source for human aluminum exposure in terms of dose. For example, Maalox, taken as directed, can exceed the daily safety limit more than 100-fold, and nowhere on the label does it say to not take it with acidic beverages such as fruit juice. Washing an antacid down with orange juice can increase aluminum absorption 8-fold, and citric acid–the acid found naturally concentrated in lemon and limes—is even worse. Just as sour fruits can enhance the absorption of iron (a good thing), through the same mechanism they may enhance the absorption of aluminum (a bad thing). This raises the question of what happens when one adds lemon juice to tea? Previously, I concluded that the amount of aluminum in tea is not a problem for most people because it’s not very absorbable (See Is There Too Much Aluminum in Tea?). What if we add lemon? Researchers publishing in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology found no difference between tea with lemon, tea without lemon, or no tea at all in terms of the amount of aluminum in the bloodstream, suggesting that tea drinking does not significantly contribute to aluminum getting inside the body. The researchers used black tea, green tea, white tea, and oolong tea, but what about the “red zinger” herbal tea, hibiscus? The reason hibiscus tea is called “sour tea” is because it has natural acids in it like citric acid. Might these acids boost the absorption of any hibiscus’ aluminum? While a greater percentage of aluminum gets from the hibiscus into the tea water than from the other teas, there’s less aluminum overall. The real question is whether the aluminum then gets from the tea water into our bodies. We don’t have those data; so, to be on the safe side we should assume the worst: that hibiscus tea aluminum, unlike green and black tea aluminum, is completely absorbable. In that case, based on these data and the World Health Organization weekly safety limit, we may not want to drink more than 15 cups of hibiscus tea a day, (based on someone who’s about 150 pounds). If you have a 75 pound 10-year-old, a half-gallon a day may theoretically be too much. Recent, more extensive testing highlighted in my video, How Much Hibiscus Tea is Too Much?, suggests that aluminum levels may reach a level twice as high.  Therefore, to be safe, no more than about two quarts a day for adults, or one quart a day for kids or pregnant women. Hibiscus tea should be completely avoided by infants under six months—who should only be getting breast milk—as well as kids with kidney failure, who can’t efficiently excrete it. There is also a concern about the impressive manganese level in hibiscus tea. Manganese is an essential trace mineral, a vital component of some of our most important antioxidant enzymes, but we probably only need about two to five milligrams a day. Four cups of hibiscus tea can have as much as 17 milligrams, with an average of about ten. Is that a problem? One study from the University of Wisconsin found that women given 15 milligrams of manganese a day for four months saw, if anything, an improvement in their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant enzyme activity. Another study, using 20 milligrams a day, similarly showed no adverse short-term effects, and importantly showed that the retention of dietary manganese is regulated. Our bodies aren’t stupid; if we take in too much manganese, we decrease the absorption and increase the excretion. Even though tea drinkers may get ten times the manganese load (10 or 20 milligrams a day), the levels in their blood are essentially identical. There is little evidence that dietary manganese poses a risk. These studies were conducted with regular tea, though; so, we don’t know about the absorption from hibiscus. To err on the side of caution, we should probably not routinely exceed the reference dose of ten milligrams per day, or about a quart a day for adults and a half-quart for a 75 pound child. I’ve actually changed my consumption. Given the benefits of the stuff, I was using it as a substitute for drinking water, drinking around two quarts a day. I was also blending the hibiscus petals in, not throwing them away, effectively doubling the aluminum content, and increasing manganese concentrations by about 30%. So, given these data, I’ve cut back to no more than a quart of filtered hibiscus tea a day. Lemon can actually boost the antioxidant content of green and white tea. See Green Tea vs. White. For a comparison of their cancer-fighting effects in vitro, Antimutagenic Activity of Green Versus White Tea. Before that, I covered another potential downside of sour tea consumption in Protecting Teeth From Hibiscus Tea, and before that, a reason we should all consider drinking it in: Hibiscus Tea vs. Plant-Based Diets for Hypertension.

A-84	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/17/aluminum-levels-in-tea/	Aluminum Levels in Tea	While aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth, it may not be good for our brain, something we learned studying foundry workers exposed to particularly high levels. Although the role of aluminum in the development of brain diseases like Alzheimer’s is controversial, to be prudent, steps should probably be taken to lessen our exposure to this metal. There are a number of aluminum-containing drugs on the market (like antacids, which have the highest levels), though aluminum compounds are also added to processed foods such as anti-caking agents in pancake mix, melting agents in American cheese, meat binders, gravy thickeners, rising agents in some baking powders and dye-binders in candy. Therefore, it’s better to stick to unprocessed, natural foods. Also, if you cook those natural foods in an aluminum pot, a significant amount of aluminum can leach into the food (compared to cooking in stainless steel). When researchers tried the same experiment with tea, they got a few milligrams of aluminum regardless of what type of pot they used, suggesting that aluminum was in the tea itself. Indeed, back in the 1950’s, researchers noticed that tea plants tended to suck up aluminum from the soil. But it’s the dose that makes the poison. According to the World Health Organization, the provisional tolerable weekly intake—our best guess at a safety limit for aluminum—is two mg per healthy kilogram of body weight per week, which is nearly a milligram per pound. Someone who weighs around 150 pounds probably shouldn’t ingest more than around 20 mg of aluminum per day. Up to a fifth of aluminum intake may come from beverages; so, what we drink probably shouldn’t contribute more than about four mg a day, the amount found in about five cups of green, black, or oolong tea. So, should we not drink more than five cups of tea a day? It’s not what you eat or drink, it’s what you absorb. If we just measured how much aluminum was in tea, it would seem as though a couple cups could double aluminum intake for the day. But if we measure the level of aluminum in people’s bodies after they drink tea, it doesn’t go up. This suggests that the bioavailability of aluminum in tea is low, possibly because most of the extractable aluminum in brewed tea is strongly bound to large phytonutrients that are not easily absorbed; so, the aluminum just passes right through us without actually getting into our bodies. Probably more than 90 percent of the aluminum in tea is bound up. One study out of Singapore, highlighted in my video, Is There Too Much Aluminum in Tea?, did show a large spike in aluminum excretion through the urine after drinking tea compared to water. The only way for something to get from our mouth to our bladder is to first be absorbed into our bloodstream. But the researchers weren’t comparing the same quantity of tea to water. They had the study subject chug down about eight and a half cups of tea, or drink water at their leisure. Therefore, the tea drinkers peed a lot more; so, the aluminum content cup-for-cup was no different for tea versus water. This suggests that gross aluminum absorption from tea is unlikely and that only a little aluminum is potentially available for absorption. So, although as few as four cups of tea could provide 100 percent of our daily aluminum limit, the percentage available for absorption in the intestine may be less than 10 percent. It is, therefore, unlikely that moderate amounts of tea drinking can have any harmful effects—for people with normal aluminum excretion. Tea may not, however, be a good beverage for children with kidney failure, since they can’t get rid of aluminum as efficiently. For most people, though, tea shouldn’t be a problem. On a special note, if you drink tea out of a can, buy undented cans. The aluminum in dented cans can leach into the liquid, boosting aluminum levels by a factor of eight while sitting on store shelves for a year. What about the levels and absorbability of the aluminum in my other favorite type of tea? Find out in my video, How Much Hibiscus Tea is Too Much? The tea plant also sucks up fluoride. So much so that heavy tea drinking can stain the teeth of children. See my video Childhood Tea Drinking May Increase Fluorosis Risk. Why should we go out of our way to drink tea?

A-85	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/12/rinse-your-mouth-after-sour-foods-and-drinks/	Rinse Your Mouth After Sour Foods & Drinks	Hibiscus tea has been found to be as effective at lowering blood pressure as a leading hypertension drug without the potential side-effects (which include everything from lack of strength to impotence, including rare cases of potentially fatal liver damage). Hibiscus, though, may have adverse effects of its own. As I’ve reviewed previously in Plant-Based Diets: Oral Health, people who eat plant-based diets appear to have superior periodontal health, including less gum disease and fewer signs of inflammation, like bleeding. However, they also have twice the prevalence of dental erosions, areas on the teeth where the enamel has thinned due to more frequent consumption of acidic fruits and vegetables. Therefore, after we eat something like citrus, we should swish our mouths with water to clear the acid from our teeth. This includes beverages. I’m a big fan of hibiscus tea, but it’s not called “sour tea” for nothing. In a study highlighted in my video, Protecting Teeth from Hibiscus Tea, researchers at the University of Iowa dental school tested 25 different popular teas and found two with a pH under 3 (as acidic as orange juice or coca cola): Tazo’s passion and Bigelow’s red raspberry, both of which contain hibiscus as their first ingredient. To see if these teas could actually dissolve teeth, the researchers took 30 extracted molars from people and soaked them in different teas. And indeed, out of the five teas tested, the greatest erosion came from the tea with the most hibiscus. The researchers left the tooth sitting in the tea for 25 hours straight, but this was to simulate a lifetime of exposure. The bottom line is that herbal teas are potentially erosive, particularly fruity and citrusy teas like hibiscus. To minimize the erosive potential, we can use a straw to drink the beverage. And as I mentioned above, after consuming an acidic food or drink we should also rinse our mouth with water to help neutralize the acid. For more on the effects of hibiscus on blood pressure, see the previous video, Hibiscus Tea vs. Plant-Based Diets for Hypertension. Are there other potential downsides to tea drinking? That’s the topic of my videos: Is There Too Much Aluminum in Tea? and How Much Hibiscus Tea is Too Much?

A-86	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/10/plant-based-diets-for-hypertension/	Plant-Based Diets for Hypertension	Recently, researchers from Taiwan pitted the herbal tea hibiscus against obesity. They gave hibiscus to overweight individuals and reported that subjects showed reduced body weight. However, after 12 weeks on hibiscus, subjects only lost about three pounds, only one and a half pounds over placebo. Hibiscus is clearly no magic fix for obesity. The purported cholesterol-lowering property of hibiscus tea looked a bit more promising. Some older studies suggested as much as an 8% reduction from drinking two cups a day for a month. When all the studies are put together, though, the results are pretty much a wash. This may be because only about 50% of people respond at all to drinking the equivalent of between two to five cups a day, though those that do may get a respectable 12% drop. That’s nothing like the 30% one can get within weeks of eating a healthy, plant-based diet, though. Hibiscus may really shine in treating high blood pressure, a disease affecting a billion people and killing millions. Up until 2010, there wasn’t sufficient high quality research to support the use of hibiscus tea to treat hypertension, but there are now randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled studies where hibiscus tea is compared to artificially colored and flavored water that looks and tastes like hibiscus tea, and the tea lowers blood pressure significantly better. We’re still not sure how it works, but hibiscus appears to boost nitric oxide production, which could help our arteries relax and dilate better. Regardless, an updated review acknowledged that the daily consumption of hibiscus tea may indeed significantly lower blood pressures in people with hypertension. How does hibiscus compare to other blood pressure interventions? The premier clinical trial when it comes to comprehensive lifestyle modification for blood pressure control is the PREMIER Clinical Trial. Realizing that nine out of ten Americans are going to develop hypertension, researchers from John Hopkins randomized 800 men and women with high blood pressure into one of three groups. One was the control group, the so-called “advice only group,” where patients were just told to lose weight, cut down on salt, increase exercise and eat healthier. In the two behavioral intervention groups, the researchers got serious. Eighteen face-to-face sessions, group meetings, food diaries, physical activity records, and calorie and sodium intake monitoring. One intervention group just concentrated on exercise; the other included exercise and diet. Researchers pushed the DASH diet, which is high in fruits and vegetables and low in full-fat dairy products and meat. In six months, subjects achieved a 4.3 point drop in systolic blood pressure, compared to the control, slightly better than the lifestyle intervention without the diet. A few points might not sound like a lot—that’s like someone going from a blood pressure of 150 over 90 to a blood pressure of 146 over 90—but on a population scale, a five point drop in the total number could result in 14% fewer stroke deaths, 9% fewer fatal heart attacks, and 7% fewer deaths every year overall. A cup of hibiscus tea with each meal didn’t just lower blood pressure by three, four, or five points, but by seven points, from an average of 129 down to 122. In fact, tested head-to-head against a leading blood-pressure drug, Captopril, two cups of strong hibiscus tea every morning (five tea bags for the two cups) was as effective in lowering blood pressure as a starting dose of 25mg of captopril taken twice a day. So, hibiscus tea is as good as drugs, without side-effects, and better than diet and exercise? Well, the lifestyle interventions in the PREMIER study were pretty wimpy. As public health experts noted, the PREMIER study was only asking for 30 minutes of exercise a day, whereas the World Health Organization recommends a minimum of an hour a day. Diet-wise, the lower the animal fat intake, and the more plant sources of protein the PREMIER participants were eating, the better the diet appeared to work. This may explain why vegetarian diets appear to work even better, and the more plant-based, the lower the prevalence of hypertension. On the DASH diet, subjects cut down on meat, but were still eating it every day, so would qualify as nonvegetarians in the Adventist 2 study (highlighted in my video Hibiscus Tea vs. Plant-Based Diets for Hypertension) which looked at 89,000 Californians. It found that those who only ate meat on a weekly basis had 23% lower rates of high blood pressure. Those who cut out all meat except fish had 38% lower rates. Those eating no meat at all, vegetarians, have less than half the rate. The vegans—cutting out all animal protein and fat—appeared to have thrown three quarters of their risk for this major killer out the window. One sees the same kind of step-wise drop in diabetes rates as one’s diet gets more and more plant-based, and a drop in excess body weight, such that only those eating completely plant-based diets in the Adventist 2 study fell into the ideal weight category. Could that be why those eating plant-based have such great blood pressure? Maybe it’s just because they’re so skinny. I’ve previously shown how those eating plant-based just have a fraction of the diabetes risk even at the same weight, but what about hypertension? The average American has what’s called prehypertension, which means the top number of our blood pressure is between 120 and 139. We don’t have hypertension yet, which starts at 140, but we may be well on our way. Compare that to the blood pressure of those eating whole food plant-based diets. In one study, those eating plant-based didn’t have blood pressures three points lower, four points lower, or even seen points lower, but 28 points lower. However, the group eating the standard American diet was, on average, overweight with a BMI over 26, still better than most Americans, while the vegans were a trim 21—that’s 36 pounds lighter. Maybe the only reason those eating meat, eggs, dairy, and processed junk had such higher blood pressure was because they were overweight. Maybe the diet per se had nothing to do with it? To solve that riddle we would have to find a group still eating the standard American diet, but as slim as vegans. To find a group that trim, researchers had to use long-distance endurance athletes, who ate the same crappy American diet, but ran an average of 48 miles per week for 21 years. Anyone who runs almost two marathons a week for 20 years can be as slim as a vegan—no matter what they eat! How did the endurance runners compare to the couch potato vegans? It appears that if we run an average of about a thousand miles every year, our blood pressures can rival some couch potato vegans. That doesn’t mean we can’t do both, but it may be easier to just eat plants. Those who’ve been following my work for years have seen how my videos have evolved. In the past, the hibiscus results may have been the whole article or video. But thanks to everyone’s support, I’ve been able to delegate the logistics to staff and concentrate more on the content creation. This allows me to do deeper dives into the literature to put new findings into better context. The posts are a bit longer, but hopefully they’re more useful—let me know what you think! For such a leading killer, hypertension has not gotten the coverage it deserves on NutritionFacts.org. Here’s a few videos, with more to come: So, should we all be drinking hibiscus tea every day?  This is the first of a four part series on the latest on hibiscus.

A-87	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/05/how-to-treat-prediabetes-with-diet/	How to Treat Prediabetes with Diet	For people with prediabetes, lifestyle modification is considered “the cornerstone of diabetes prevention.” Diet-wise, this means individuals with prediabetes or diabetes should aim to reduce their intake of excess calories, saturated fat, and trans fat. Too many of us consume a diet with too many solid fats and added sugars. Thankfully the latest dietary guidelines aim to shift consumption towards more plant-based foods. Lifestyle modification is now the foundation of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology guidelines, the European Diabetes Association guidelines, and the official standards of care for the American Diabetes Association. Dietary strategies include reducing intake of fat and increasing intake of fiber (meaning unrefined plant foods, including whole grains). The recommendation to consume more whole grains is based on research showing that eating lots of whole grains is associated with reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. New research even suggests that whole grains may protect against prediabetes in the first place. According to the American Diabetes Association’s official standards of care (which you can see in my video Lifestyle Medicine Is the Standard of Care for Prediabetes), dietary recommendations should focus on reducing saturated fat, cholesterol and trans fat intake (meat, dairy, eggs and junk food). Recommendations should also focus on increasing omega 3’s, soluble fiber and phytosterols, all three of which can be found together in flax seeds; an efficient, but still uncommon, intervention for prediabetes. In one study, about two tablespoons of ground flax seed a day decreased insulin resistance (the hallmark of the disease). If the standards of care for all the major diabetes groups say that lifestyle is the preferred treatment for prediabetes because it’s safe and highly effective, why don’t more doctors do it? Unfortunately, the opportunity to treat this disease naturally is often unrecognized. Only about one in three patients report ever being told about diet or exercise. Possible reasons for not counseling patients include lack of reimbursement, lack of resources, lack of time, and lack of skill. It may be because doctors aren’t getting paid to do it. Why haven’t reimbursement policies been modified? One crucial reason may be a failure of leadership in the medical profession and medical education to recognize and respond to the changing nature of disease patterns. “The inadequacy of clinical education is a consequence of the failure of health care and medical education to adapt to the great transformation of disease from acute to chronic. Chronic disease is now the principal cause of disability, consuming three quarters of our sickness-care system. Why has there been little academic response to the rising prevalence of chronic disease?” How far behind the times is the medical profession? A report by the Institute of Medicine on medical training concluded that the fundamental approach to medical education “has not changed since 1910.”   I hope my work is helping to fill the gap with the information about preventing and treating chronic disease that medical professionals are not getting during training. That’s actually how this all started. I would make trips to Countway Library of Medicine at the beginning of every month in medical school to read all the new journal issues. I felt I had a duty to my patients to stay on top of the literature. But hey, since I’m doing so much work, might as well share it! So, what started as an email newsletter morphed into a medical school speaking tour into a DVD series and then now all online for everyone.

A-88	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/05/03/sprouted-lentils-healthier-canned-lentils/	Are Sprouted Lentils Healthier Than Canned Lentils?	Beans, chickpeas, split peas and lentils are packed with nutrients and play a role in the prevention of chronic disease, but most can’t be eaten raw. Some can be sprouted, though. Boiling is the most common cooking method, which is used for canned beans. Which is healthier, though, cooked or sprouted? The easiest way to compare healthfulness is to measure nutrient levels—such as the anthocyanin pigments that make kidney beans so pretty—thought to account for some of beans’ protective benefits against chronic disease. Sprouted beans have more of some anthocyanins, but less than others. We find this same pattern across the board with the other phenolic phytonutrients: sprouted beans have more of some, less of others. Because the positive effects of these compounds may be related to their antioxidant capacity, we can compare the overall antioxidant power of boiled versus sprouted beans. In that case, boiled appears to have a marginal edge. Ideally, though, rather than merely comparing concentrations of phytochemicals, we’d measure physiological effects. For example, we might look at the effect of boiled versus sprouted beans against cancer cell growth. That’s exactly what researchers did. In my video Cooked Beans or Sprouted Beans?, you can see the concentrations of bean extract needed to cut the breast cancer growth rate in half in a petri dish. Boiled beans do about 40 times better than raw beans—the same cancer growth inhibition at just a fraction of the concentration. Sprouted beans do about the same. We can’t eat most beans raw, but I wanted to include them to show you a fascinating phenomenon. No amount of raw bean extract appears to totally stop the growth of breast cancer cells, but just small amounts of cooked or sprouted beans can. We find the same thing with killing off cancer. No amount of raw bean extract can fully kill off breast cancer cells, but both boiled and sprouted beans can. Similar results were found for melanoma cells, a type of malignant skin cancer. Processing the beans—either cooking or sprouting—boosted anticancer activity in vitro. However, against kidney cancer, raw and boiled worked, but sprouted didn’t at all. There has also been interest in brain protection. Given that elderly persons who report always eating legumes may be significantly less likely to experience cognitive decline, a group of Chinese researchers decided to compare the protective effects of boiled versus sprouted beans on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant type of cell in our brain. They are star-shaped cells that keep our brain running smoothly. Should they become damaged, though, they may play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Lou Gehrig’s disease, Alzheimer’s, or Parkinson’s. So, if we’re thinking clearly, we should thank our lucky stars. To see if beans help protect astrocytes from damage, we’d have to first make sure bean extracts wouldn’t cause any damage. Cooked beans don’t seem to hurt cells at all, and sprouted beans seem to even help them grow a little. If we add an oxidative chemical to the cells, we can kill off about a quarter of them. However, if we add that chemical along with some boiled bean extract, the astrocytes were partially protected at higher doses. Sprouted bean extract didn’t appear to offer significant benefit. What’s the takeaway? As far as I’m concerned, we should eat beans in whichever way will get us to eat the most of them. I do love my lentil sprouts, one of the healthiest snacks on the planet (along with kale chips). I can grow my own in just 2 to 3 days. But using canned beans I can get similar nutrition in about 2 to 3 seconds. Sprouting is so much fun, though! I’ve got a bunch of videos on broccoli sprouts, for example: Biggest Nutrition Bang for Your Buck. But again, whichever way we like them we should eat them. Why? See: Mostly I just used canned.

A-89	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/28/egg-consumption-and-ldl-cholesterol-size/	Egg Consumption & LDL Cholesterol Size	Maria Fernandez has received nearly a half million dollars from the egg industry and writes papers like “Rethinking dietary cholesterol.” She admits that eggs can raise LDL cholesterol, bad cholesterol, but argues that HDL, so-called “good cholesterol,” also rises, thereby maintaining the ratio of bad to good. To support this assertion, she cites one study that she performed with Egg Board money that involved 42 people. If we look at a meta-analysis, a measure of the balance of evidence, the rise in bad is much more than the rise in good with increasing cholesterol intake. The analysis of 17 different studies showed that dietary cholesterol increases the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol, suggesting that the favorable rise in HDL fails to compensate for the adverse rise in total and LDL cholesterol. Therefore, increased intake of dietary cholesterol from eggs may indeed raise the risk of coronary heart disease. The Egg Board responded (as seen in my video, Does Cholesterol Size Matter?) by saying that the increased heart disease risk associated with eating eggs needs to be put in perspective relative to other risk factors, arguing that it’s worse to be overweight than it is to eat eggs, to which the authors of the meta-analysis replied, “Be that as it may, many people do not find it a major hardship to cut back on egg intake, whereas most people find it impossible to lose weight permanently.” Fine, Fernandez admitted, eggs increase LDL, but she claims that the increase is in large LDL, arguing that large, fluffy LDL particles are not as bad as small, dense particles. Indeed, large LDL only raises heart disease risk of women by 44%, instead of 63% for small LDL. Light large buoyant LDL still significantly increases our risk of dying from our #1 killer. The difference is similar for men: large LDL only increases risk of heart attack or death by 31%, instead of 44%. As the latest review on the subject concluded, LDL cholesterol has “clearly been established as a causal agent in atherosclerosis … Regardless of size, LDL particles are atherogenic.” Yet Egg Board researcher, Fernandez, wrote that the formation of larger LDL from eggs is considered protective against heart disease, relative to small LDL. That’s like saying getting stabbed with a knife is protective–relative to getting shot! Health practitioners should bear in mind, she writes, that “restricting dietary cholesterol puts a burden on egg intake” and leads to the avoidance of a food that contains dietary components like carotenoids and choline. She wrote this in 2012, before the landmark 2013 study showing that choline from eggs appears to increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death, so she can be excused for that. But what about the carotenoids in eggs, like lutein and zeaxanthin, which are so important for protecting vision and reducing cholesterol oxidation? As I explored previously, the amounts of these phytonutrients in eggs are miniscule. One spoonful of spinach contains as much as nine eggs. Comparing the predictable effects on eye health of organic free-range eggs versus corn and spinach, the effect of eggs is tiny. What about the effects of eggs on cholesterol oxidation? We’ve known for decades that LDL cholesterol is bad, but oxidized LDL is even worse. Therefore, according to Fernandez, since eggs have trace amounts of antioxidants, eggs may prevent cholesterol oxidation. But the science shows the exact opposite. Consumption of eggs increases the susceptibility of LDL cholesterol to oxidation. The researchers found that not only does eating eggs raise LDL levels, but also increases LDL oxidizability, in addition to the oxidizability of our entire bloodstream. This was published 18 years ago, yet Fernandez still tries to insinuate that eggs would reduce oxidation. She acknowledges receiving funding from the American Egg Board, and then claims she has no conflicts of interest. This is why a site like NutritionFacts.org can be so useful, because even when a paper is published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, it can misrepresent the science. But who has time to check the primary sources? I do! If you’d like to support this work, please consider making a tax-deductible donation.

A-90	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/26/how-to-protect-our-telomeres-with-diet/	How to Protect Our Telomeres with Diet	In my video, Does Meditation Affect Cellular Aging?, I discussed how stress reduction through meditation might be able to lengthen telomeres, the protective caps at the tips of our chromosomes that tend to deplete as we age. What about exercise? We can’t always change our situation in life, but we can always go out for a walk. London researchers studied 2,400 twins, and those who exercised more may have pumped up their telomeres along with their muscles. Apparently it doesn’t take much either. The “heavy” exercise group was only averaging about a half-hour a day. These were mostly folks in their 40’s, but does it still work in your 50’s? Yes. A study out of South Korea found that people in their 50’s who work out three hours a week had longer telomeres. In my video, Telomeres: Cap It All Off with Diet, you can see the telomere lengths of young healthy regular folk controls at around age 20, and then at age 50. As we’d expect, the older subjects’ telomeres were significantly shorter. What about athletes? The young athletes started out in the same boat, with nice, long, young, healthy telomeres capping all their chromosomes. The older athletes, in contrast to the controls, appeared to still have the chromosomes of 20-year-olds. But these were marathon runners, triathletes running 50 miles a week for 35 years. What was it about the Ornish intervention that so powerfully protected telomeres after just three months? We saw that stress management seems to help, but what about diet and exercise? Was it the plant-based diet, was it the walking 30 minutes a day, or was it just because of the weight loss? In 2013, a study was published that can help us answer just that question. The researchers took about 400 women and randomized them into four groups: a portion-controlled diet group, an exercise group, a portion controlled diet and exercise group, and a control group for a full year. In the video, you can see a comparison of the length of each group’s telomeres. After a year of doing nothing, there was essentially no change in the control group, which is what we’d expect. The exercise group was 45 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise like jogging. After a year of that, they did no better. What about just weight loss? Nothing. The same thing for exercise and weight loss, no significant change either. So, as long as we’re eating the same diet, it doesn’t appear to matter how small our portions are, or how much weight we lose, or how hard we exercise. After a year, the subjects saw no benefit. On the other hand, the Ornish group on the plant-based diet, who lost the same amount of weight after just three months and exercised less than half as hard, saw significant telomere protection. It wasn’t the weight loss or the exercise: it was the food. What aspects of a plant-based diet make it so protective? Studies have associated more vegetables and fruit, and less butter, with longer telomeres. From the latest review, foods high in fiber and vitamins are strongly related to longer telomeres. However, the key may be avoiding saturated fat. Swapping just 1%  of saturated fat calories in our diet for anything else can add nearly a whole year of aging’s worth of length onto our telomeres. Saturated fats like palmitic acid, the primary saturated fat in salmon, and found in meat, eggs, and dairy in general, can be toxic to cells. This has been demonstrated in heart cells, bone marrow cells, pancreatic cells, and brain cells. The toxic effects on cell death rates happen right around what you’d see in the blood stream of people who eat a lot of animal products. It may not be the saturated fat itself, however, as saturated fat may just be a marker for the increased oxidative stress and inflammation associated with those foods. With this link to saturated fat, it’s no wonder that lifelong low cholesterol levels have been related to longer telomeres and a smaller proportion of short telomeres—in other words, markers of slower biological aging. In fact, there’s a rare congenital birth defect called progeria syndrome, where children age 8-10 times faster than normal. It seems associated with a particular inability to handle animal fats. The good news is that “despite past accumulated injury leading to shorter telomere lengths, current healthy behaviors might help to decrease a person’s risk of some of the potential consequences like heart disease.” Eating more fruit and vegetables and less meat and having more support from friends and family attenuate the association between shorter telomeres and the ravages of aging. To summarize: inflammation, oxidation, damage and dysfunction are constantly hacking away at our telomeres. At the same time, our antioxidant defenses, healthy diet, exercise and stress reduction are constantly rebuilding them.   I’ve asked this diet versus exercise question in a few other contexts. See: Though dietary change appears more impactful, I’m a big fan of walking. See Longer Life Within Walking Distance and for my personal favorite exercise, Standing Up for Your Health.

A-91	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/21/how-many-minutes-of-daily-meditation-to-combat-stress/	How Many Minutes of Daily Meditation to Combat Stress?	In the film The Holiday, Cameron Diaz exclaims “Severe stress … causes the DNA in our cells to shrink until they can no longer replicate.” Did Hollywood get the science right? The enzyme that builds and maintains the caps at the tips of our chromosomes (called telomeres) appears to slow the aging of our cells. Do people who are stressed have shorter telomeres? To answer that question, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco measured the telomere lengths in mothers of chronically ill children—what could be more stressful than that? The longer a woman had spent being the main caretaker of her ill child, the shorter her telomeres. The extra telomere shortening in the most stressed mothers was equivalent to that caused by at least a decade of aging. We see the same thing in caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients and in those suffering severe work-related exhaustion. Even those abused as children may grow up with shorter telomeres. There’s not much we can do about our past, but if we manage our stress now, can we grow some telomeres back? If we go on a meditation retreat and meditate for 500 hours, we can indeed boost our telomerase activity (the enzyme that restores our telomeres)—but there’s got to be a quicker fix. In an exciting study from UCLA and UC San Francisco (highlighted in my video, Does Meditation Affect Cellular Aging?, caregivers of family members with dementia were randomized to just 12 minutes of daily meditation for eight weeks, or just about ten hours in total. The meditators experienced significant benefit, including better mental and psychological function accompanied by an increase in telomerase activity, suggesting an improvement in stress-induced cellular aging. Here’s a link to the backgrounder video that presents the original Ornish study: Research Into Reversing Aging. I cover the comparable effects of diet and exercise in my video Telomeres – Cap It All Off with Diet.

A-92	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/14/can-turmeric-help-with-alzheimers/	Can Turmeric Help with Alzheimer’s?	The spice turmeric may help prevent Alzheimer’s disease (See Preventing Alzheimer’s with Turmeric), but what about treating Alzheimer’s disease with turmeric? An exciting case series was published in 2012 (highlighted in my video, Treating Alzheimer’s with Turmeric): three Alzheimer’s patients were treated with turmeric, and their symptoms improved. In case number one, an 83-year-old woman started losing her memory and feeling disoriented. She started having problems taking care of herself, wandering aimlessly and became incontinent. After taking a teaspoon of turmeric per day however, her agitation, apathy, anxiety and irritability were relieved and she had less accidents. Furthermore, she began to laugh again, sing again, and knit again. After taking turmeric for more than a year, she came to recognize her family and now lives a peaceful life without a significant behavioral or psychological symptom of dementia. Case number two was similar, but with the additional symptoms of hallucinations, delusions and depression, which were relieved by turmeric. She began to recognize her family again and now lives in a peacefully serene manner. And the third case, similar as well, included an improvement in cognition. Researchers concluded that this was the first demonstration of turmeric as an effective and safe “drug” for the treatment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in Alzheimer’s patients. They call it a drug, but it’s just a spice you can walk into any grocery store and buy for a few bucks. They were giving people like a teaspoon a day, which comes out to be about 15 cents. Two trials using curcumin supplements rather than turmeric, however, failed to show a benefit. Curcumin is just one of hundreds of phytochemicals found in turmeric. Concentrated into pill form at up to 40 times the dose, no evidence of efficacy was found. Why didn’t they get the same dramatic results we saw in the three case reports? Well, those three cases may have been total flukes, but on the other hand, turmeric, the whole food, may be greater than the sum of its parts. There is a long list of compounds that have been isolated from turmeric, and it’s possible that each component plays a distinct role in making it useful against Alzheimer’s disease. Hence, researchers suggested that a mixture of compounds might better represent turmeric in its medicinal value better than curcumin alone. But why concoct some artificial mixture when Mother Nature already did it for us with turmeric? Because you can’t patent the spice. And if you can’t patent it, how are you going to charge more than 15 cents? I’ve previously addressed the thorny issue of patenting natural plant remedies in my video: Plants as Intellectual Property – Patently Wrong? The whole-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts theme is one that comes up over and over: What else might the cheap, easily available spice turmeric do?

A-93	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/12/might-turmeric-help-prevent-alzheimers/	Might Turmeric Help Prevent Alzheimer’s?	There are plenty of anti-inflammatory drugs out there that may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, but stomach, liver, and kidney toxicity precludes their widespread use. So, maybe using an anti-inflammatory food like the spice, turmeric, found in curry powder, could offer the benefits without the risks? Before even considering putting it to the test, though, one might ask, “Well, do populations that eat a lot of turmeric have a lower prevalence of dementia?” And indeed, those living in rural India who do just that may actually have the lowest reported prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer’s. In rural Pennsylvania, the incidence rate of Alzheimer’s disease among seniors is 19/1000. Nineteen people in a thousand over age 65 develop Alzheimer’s every year in rural Pennsylvania. In rural India, using the same diagnostic criteria, that same rate is three, confirming they have among the lowest reported Alzheimer’s rates in the world. Although the lower prevalence of Alzheimer’s in India is generally attributed to the turmeric consumption as a part of curry, and it is assumed that people who use turmeric regularly have a lower incidence of the disease, let’s not just assume. As highlighted in my video, Preventing Alzheimer’s with Turmeric, a thousand people were tested, and those who consumed curry at least occasionally did better on simple cognitive tests than those who didn’t. Those that ate curry often also had only about half the odds of showing cognitive impairment, after adjusting for a wide variety of potential confounding factors. This suggests that curry consumption may indeed be associated with better cognitive performance. Of course, it probably matters what’s being curried—are we talking chicken masala, or chana masala, with chickpeas instead of chicks? It may be no coincidence that the country with among the lowest rates of Alzheimer’s also has among the lowest rates of meat consumption, with a significant percentage of Indians eating meat-free and egg-free diets. Studies have suggested for nearly 20 years now that those who eat meat—red meat or white meat—appear between two to three times more likely to become demented compared to vegetarians. And the longer one eats meat-free, the lower the associated risk of dementia, whether or not you like curry. There’s another spice that may be useful for brain health. See my video Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s. What about coconut oil? See Does Coconut Oil Cure Alzheimer’s? In terms of preventing cognitive decline in the first place, check out my video How to Slow Brain Aging By Two Years.

A-94	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/07/eating-garlic-raisins-may-help-prevent-preterm-birth/	Eating Garlic & Raisins May Help Prevent Preterm Birth	The United States has one of the worst premature birth rates in the world, now ranking 131st worldwide. Even worse, over the last few decades, the rate of preterm birth in the U.S. has been going up. We’ve known that preterm delivery is associated with significant problems during infancy, and almost three quarters of all infant deaths. Unfortunately, even preemies who survive past infancy may carry a legacy of health issues, such as behavioral problems, moderate to severe neurodevelopmental disabilities, and psychiatric disorders in half of those born extremely preterm by the time they reach school-age. There’s even evidence now that adults born very prematurely are at increased risk for things like heart disease and diabetes. And babies don’t even have to be born that premature to suffer long-term effects. Even so-called near-term births at 36 or 37 weeks are now thought to be related to subtle developmental problems. So, what can pregnant women do to decrease this risk? 66,000 pregnant women were studied to examine whether an association exists between maternal dietary patterns and risk of preterm delivery. Researchers compared a so-called “prudent” diet (vegetables, fruits, oils, water as beverage, whole grain cereals, fiber rich bread), which was more plant-based versus a “Western” or traditional Scandinavian diet (salty and sweet snacks, white bread, desserts, processed meat products), and found that the “prudent” pattern was associated with significantly reduced risk of preterm delivery. Inflammation is thought to play a role in triggering delivery; so, a diet characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit, and berries can reduce both systemic and local inflammation, and the lower saturated fat levels would also be associated with reduced inflammation. Any foods in particular? A significant percentage of preterm deliveries are thought to be related to infections and inflammatory conditions in the genital tract. Garlic is well-known for its antimicrobial properties, and also has probiotic dietary fibers that feed our good bacteria. Dried fruit is also packed with fiber and has antimicrobial activities against some of the bacteria suspected to play a role in preterm delivery. Researchers (highlighted in my video, Garlic and Raisins to Prevent Premature Birth) studied the garlic, onion, and dried fruit intake of nearly 19,000 pregnant women, and indeed, they observed a reduced risk of spontaneous preterm delivery related to groups of garlic and onion family vegetables and dried fruits. In particular, garlic stood out for the vegetables and raisins stood out for the dried fruit. Both were associated with a reduced risk of both preterm delivery and preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes, which means your water breaking prematurely (before 37 weeks). And it didn’t seem to take much. The so-called “high” garlic intake associated with the lowest risk was just about one clove a week or more, and “high” raisin intake was defined as just one of those mini snack boxes of raisins a month.

A-95	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/05/dioxins-in-us-farm-raised-catfish/	Dioxins in U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish	Dioxins are highly toxic pollutants that accumulate in tissue fat. Almost all dioxins found in people who don’t work in toxic waste dumps or something similarly hazardous are believed to come from food, especially meat, milk, and fish, which account for about 95% of human exposure. We tend to only hear about it in the news, though, when there’s some mass poisoning. In 1957, for example, millions of chickens began dying, blamed on toxic components in certain feed fats. Factory farming was taking off, and the industry needed cheap feed to fatten up the birds. They ended up using a toxic fleshing grease from hide stripping operations in the leather industry that were using dioxin-containing preservatives. A subsequent outbreak in 1969 resulted from a pipe mix-up at a refinery that was producing both pesticides and animal feed. In the 1990’s, a supermarket survey found the highest concentrations of dioxins in farm-raised catfish. The source of dioxins was determined to be the feed, but that’s surprising, since catfish aren’t fed a lot of animal fat. Turns out it was dioxin-contaminated clay added to the feed as an anti-caking agent, which may have originally come from sewage sludge. The same contaminated feed was fed to chickens; so, what may have started out in sewage sludge ended up on the plates of consumers in the form of farm-raised catfish and chicken. How widespread of a problem did it become? This affected five percent of U.S. poultry production; that’s people eating hundreds of millions of contaminated chickens. And if it’s in the chickens, it’s in the eggs. Elevated dioxin levels were found in chicken eggs too. When the source of the feed contamination was identified, the USDA estimated that less than 1% of animal feed was contaminated, but 1% of egg production means over a million eggs a day. But the catfish were the worst. More than a third of all U.S. farm-raised catfish were found contaminated with dioxins thanks to that ball clay. So, the FDA requested that ball clay not be used in animal feeds. They even asked nicely, writing, “Dear producer or user of clay products in animal feeds, continued exposure to elevated dioxin levels in animal feed increases the risk of adverse health effects in those consuming animal-derived food products… we are recommending that the use of ball clay in animal feeds be discontinued…We look forward to the industry’s cooperation.” (You can see the original letter in my video, Dioxins in U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish). So, how cooperative did the industry end up being? Half a billion pounds of catfish continued to be churned out of U.S. fish farms every year, but only recently did the government go back and check. Published in 2013, samples of catfish were collected from all over the country. Dioxins were found in 96% of samples tested. Yeah, but just because catfish are bought in the U.S. doesn’t mean they came from the U.S. And indeed, some of the catfish were imported from China or Taiwan, but they were found to be ten times less contaminated. And indeed, when they checked the feed fed to U.S. catfish, more than half were contaminated, and so, it seems likely that mined clay products are still being used in U.S. catfish feeds. Even “just small amounts of mineral clays added to fish feeds, together with the fact that catfish can be bottom-feeders may lead to higher than acceptable dioxin residues in the final catfish products.” The Institute of Medicine suggests strategies to reduce dioxin intake exposure, such as trimming the fat from meat, poultry, and fish, and avoiding the recycling of animal fat into gravy, but if almost all dioxin intake comes from animal fat, then eating a more plant-based diet could wipe out about 98% of exposure. Thus, “a vegetarian diet or even just eating more plants might have previously unsuspected health advantages along with the more commonly recognized cardiovascular benefits and decreased cancer risk.” This is a good illustration of how we can’t necessarily rely on regulators to protect our families’ health. More on dietary dioxins and what we can do about them in Dioxins in the Food Supply and Counteracting the Effects of Dioxins Through Diet. Even wild fish are exposed to industrial pollutants spewed into our waterways. See, for example: Farmed fish is the worst, though: Farmed Fish vs. Wild-Caught.

A-96	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/31/dr-gregers-new-google-talk/	Dr. Greger's new Google Talk	I was recently honored to be invited to Google to present on How Not to Die, and they made it into an official Talk@Google! View the presentation I’ve been giving around the country on my book tour for free at bit.ly/googlegreger. It’s basically a 2016 updated version of my Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death talk. It’s been such a pleasure and privilege to meet so many people whose lives my work has touched over the last few months touring around the country. With my speaking tour winding down (only about 50 cities left—phew!), I’m eager to catch up on all the research I’ve missed. I just completed the next nine weeks of NutritionFacts.org videos, available now in sneak preview form as part of my new DVD, in which I do a deep dive into the subject of vinegar. Vinegar has been used as a weight-loss aid and folk remedy for diabetes for centuries, but does it actually work? Find out in my new 5-video series: *Spoiler alert*: Let’s just say I now try to sneak vinegar into all my family’s meals. I also have new videos queued up over the next few months on wheatgrass juice, Paleo diet bone broth, and protein combining. If you don’t want to wait, all of these videos are available now as a digital download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 30 (all proceeds go to charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD. The current batch of videos from volume 29 are about to run out on NutritionFacts.org. So, starting next month and running until June, I’ll roll out the videos from this new DVD, volume 30. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works—50+ hours of video—you can get the complete DVD collection. Here’s the list of chapters from the new volume 30 DVD—a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org: Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds  or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads. If you were a regular supporter, you’d already be a vinegar expert by now, having already received the new DVD. I come out with new DVDs every 9 weeks. If you’d like to automatically receive them before they’re even available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor. Anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both—your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs. If you’re already signed up and didn’t receive your volume 30 yet, please email DVDhelp@NutritionFacts.org and we’ll make everything all better. If you’d rather just watch all the videos online as they launch, but would still like to support my work of helping to educate millions about healthy eating, you can make a tax-deductible donation to my 501c3 nonprofit organization NutritionFacts.org using a credit card, Bitcoin, a direct PayPal link, or by sending a check to “NutritionFacts.org” PO Box 11400, Takoma Park, MD 20913. After spending much of the last few months on the road since the publication of How Not to Die (already in it’s 8th printing!), I’ve got a lot of catching up to do. More than 12,000 articles have been published in the scientific literature on nutrition in the last four months.

A-97	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/29/collaboration-new-vectors-disease/	When Charities Collaborate With the Food Industry	When the history of the world’s attempts to address obesity is written, one researcher writes, “the greatest failure may be collaboration with and appeasement of the food industry.” For instance, Yum! Brands, who owns Kentucky Fried Chicken, linked up with a leading U.S. breast cancer charity, to sell pink buckets of fried chicken. Save the Children, an organization aiming to positively change the lives of children, was initially a staunch supporter of soda taxes. Recently, however, the organization withdrew its support, saying that support of the soda taxes did not fit the way Save the Children works. Perhaps, it is only a coincidence that it was seeking a grant from Coca-Cola and had accepted a $5 million grant from Pepsi. Through these partnerships, the food industry seeks to emphasize that inactivity — not the promotion and consumption of its calorie-rich products — is the prime cause of obesity. But studies showing that obesity is rising even in areas where people are exercising more are most likely explained by the fact that increases in physical activity levels are being outstripped by our eating activity levels. We can’t outrun our mouths. As stated by researcher, Bruce Neal, from the University of Sydney (highlighted in my video, Collaboration with the New Vectors of Disease), “The message is plain – the primary driver of the obesity epidemic in the United States is now the food supply, and interventions targeting physical activity are not going to resolve it. So, while physical activity is good regardless, it will not address most of the burden of ill health caused by obesity. That is going to require a new focus on the root cause of the problem—the American diet.” This researcher adds, “At the heart of the ‘energy in’ side of the obesity problem is the food and beverage industry. Put simply, the enormous commercial success enjoyed by the food industry is now causing what promises to be one of the greatest public health disasters of our time. As fast as we rid the world of the microbial causes of pestilence and famine, they are replaced by new vectors of disease in the form of trans-national food corporations that market salt, fat, sugar, and calories in unprecedented quantities. So, policy makers should work on pricing strategies that subsidize the cost of healthier foods.” First, we need to shift relative prices to make it more expensive to consume animal products compared to fruit, vegetables and beans. Second, we need to increase demand for plant foods, which is not as easy given the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual subsidies – our tax payer dollars going to make animal products artificially cheap. Dr. Bruce Neal then concludes, “The food industry will rail against the ‘nanny state’ and fight tooth and nail for its right to market a range of options to responsible individuals able to make choices for themselves–it’s the American way. For context though, these arguments are no different to those used by the tobacco industry, which also markets habituating unhealthy products in pursuit of profit. In the case of tobacco, the American people have agreed that controls must be applied to limit the harms caused. Poor diet is now responsible for an even greater burden of disease than tobacco, and food companies must be controlled in the same way if the harms are to be reduced. As unpalatable as this may be, the food industry would do well to strengthen their public health conscience, given that consumers are always going to need their goods, something that cannot be said for the tobacco industry.” You hear that a lot in public health circles, how we have to work with the companies, because unlike tobacco, we have to eat. But just like yes, we need to breath, but we don’t need to breathe smoke; yes, we need to eat, but we don’t need to eat junk. Is it our physical activity or eating activity? See Diet vs. Exercise for Weight Loss and How Much Exercise to Sustain Weight Loss? I touched on the pink buckets of KFC in my video Breast Cancer Survival, Butterfat, and Chicken. For more on the idea of subsidizing healthy foods or at least stopping tax money to supporting junk, check out my video Taxpayer Subsidies for Unhealthy Foods. It’s sad when non-profits collaborate with companies that contribute to suffering, but seems particularly egregious when the Registered Dietitian group does it.

A-98	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/24/four-brazil-nuts-once-a-month/	Four Brazil Nuts Once a Month…	One of the craziest studies I read all year involved feeding people a single serving of Brazil nuts to see what it would do to the cholesterol levels of healthy volunteers. They gave ten men and women a single meal containing zero, one, four, or eight Brazil nuts, and found that the ingestion of just that single serving almost immediately improved cholesterol levels. LDL, so-called “bad” cholesterol levels in the blood, was significantly lower starting just nine hours after the ingestion of nuts, and by no insignificant amount, nearly 20 points within a day. Even drugs don’t work that fast. It takes statins around four days to have a significant effect. But that’s not even the crazy part. The researchers went back and measured their cholesterol five days later, and then 30 days later. Now, keep in mind they weren’t eating Brazil nuts this whole time. They just had that single serving of Brazil nuts a month before and their cholesterol was still down 30 days later. It went down and stayed down, after eating just four nuts… That’s nuts! And no, the study was not funded by the Brazil nut industry. Interestingly, four nuts actually seemed to work faster than the eight nuts to lower bad cholesterol and boost good cholesterol. These results suggest that eating just four nuts might be enough to improve the levels of LDL and HDL for up to 30 days, and maybe longer—they didn’t test past 30. Now normally, when a study comes out in the medical literature showing some too-good-to-be-true result like this, you want to wait to see the results replicated before you change your clinical practice, before you recommend something to your patients, particularly when the study is done on only ten people, and especially when the findings are literally just too incredible to be believed. But when the intervention is cheap, easy, harmless, and healthy—eating four Brazil nuts a month—then, in my opinion, the burden of proof is kind of reversed. I think the reasonable default position is to do it until proven otherwise. They concluded a single serving was sufficient “without producing liver and kidney toxicity.” What they’re referring to is the high selenium content of Brazil nuts—so high that four eaten every day may actually bump us up against the tolerable daily limit for selenium, but not something we have to worry about if we’re just eating four once a month. I’d be curious to hear if anyone experiences similar results. Even if the study was just a fluke, Nuts May Help Prevent Death by improving the function of our arteries (Walnuts and Artery Function) and fighting cancer (Which Nut Fights Cancer?) and inflammation (Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell). Even eating nuts every day does not appear to result in expected weight gain (Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence), so enjoy! 	-	brazil nuts,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,cholesterol,HDL cholesterol,heart disease,heart health,kidney health,LDL cholesterol,liver health,nuts,safety limits,selenium,statins	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/walnuts-and-artery-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.researchgate.net/publication/248385213_A_single_consumption_of_high_amounts_of_the_Brazil_nuts_improves_lipid_profile_of_healthy_volunteers,http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/walnuts-and-artery-function/,http://experts.umn.edu/pubDetail.asp?t=pm&id=33673496&,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/video/which-nut-fights-cancer-better/	
A-99	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/22/the-effects-of-dietary-cholesterol-on-blood-cholesterol/	The Effects of Dietary Cholesterol on Blood Cholesterol	Blood cholesterol levels are clearly increased by eating dietary cholesterol. In other words, putting cholesterol in our mouth means putting cholesterol in our blood, and it may also potentiate the harmful effects of saturated fats, meaning when we eat sausage and eggs, the eggs may make the effects of the sausage even worse. If you eat the saturated fat and cholesterol found in two sausage and egg McMuffins every day for two weeks, your cholesterol would shoot up nearly 30 points. If you eat about the same amount of saturated fat without the cholesterol, some kind of cholesterol-free sausage McMuffins without the egg, what would happen? Now the egg would have saturated fat too; so, to even it out, we have to add three strips of bacon to the comparison. Same saturated fat but two-eggs-worth less cholesterol would bump us up only around five points. So, saturated fat may increase fasting cholesterol levels more than dietary cholesterol, but especially in the presence of dietary cholesterol. And this is measuring fasting cholesterol, meaning the baseline from which all our meal-related cholesterol spikes would then shoot. Heart disease has been described as a postprandial phenomenon, meaning an after-meal phenomenon. Milky little droplets of fat and cholesterol, called chylomicrons, straight from a meal called can build up in atherosclerotic plaques just like LDL cholesterol. So, what happens after a meal that includes eggs? In my video How the Egg Board Designs Misleading Studies, you can see what happens to the level of fat and cholesterol in our blood stream for the seven hours after eating a meal with no-fat, no-cholesterol. There are hardly changes at all. But when you eat a meal with fat and more and more egg, triglycerides and blood cholesterol shoot up. That’s the kind of data that’s bad for egg sales; so, how could you design a study to hide this fact? What if you only measured fasting cholesterol levels in the morning, seven hours after supper? You wouldn’t see a big difference between those that ate eggs the night before and those that didn’t. As the lead investigator of a study which compared the cardiovascular health effects of smoking versus eating eggs pointed out, measuring fasting cholesterol is appropriate for measuring the effects of drugs suppressing our liver’s cholesterol production, but not appropriate for measuring the effects of dietary cholesterol. After a cholesterol-laden supper, our arteries are being pummeled all night long. Then, think about what’s happening during the day. There may be only four hours between breakfast and lunch. So, if we had eggs for breakfast, we’d get that big spike and by lunch start the whole cycle of fat and cholesterol in our arteries all over again. So, most of our lives are lived in a postprandial state, in an after-meal state, and the graph I show in the video shows that the amount of egg in our meals makes a big difference when it really matters—after we’ve eaten, which is where we spend most of our lives. So, that’s why when the Egg Board funds a study, they only measure fasting cholesterol levels of the next day. Doctors are so used to testing fasting cholesterol levels to monitor the effects of drugs, they too often fall for these egg industry tactics hook, line, and sinker. Please share the video with anyone who tries to downplay the risks of eggs or dietary cholesterol in general. The smoking study I mentioned can be found here: Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis.

Time availability is a reason frequently cited by physicians, but if you probe a little deeper, the number one reason given was their perception that patients fear being deprived of all the junk they’re eating. Can you imagine a doctor saying, “I’d like to tell my patients to stop smoking, but I know how much they love it”? Changes in diet to reduce cholesterol levels are often assumed to result in reductions in quality of life. Do we get to live longer or is it just going to feel longer? Contrary to popular belief, studies have found  no apparent reduction, but rather an improvement, in some measures of quality of life and patient satisfaction using  nutrition therapy as opposed to drugs for high cholesterol. Whereas people taking cholesterol-lowering drugs don’t feel any different, studies have found that those using dietary changes reported significantly better health and satisfaction, and better life in general. More positive feelings and fewer negative. In the Family Heart Study, for example, those placed on a cholesterol lowering diet showed significantly greater improvements in depression as well as a reduction in aggressive hostility. Another barrier to preventive cardiology is that doctors don’t realize how powerful dietary changes can be. The importance of diet for patients’ health remains underestimated by doctors. Even the new drug-centered cholesterol guidelines emphasize that lifestyle modification should be the foundation for the reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Despite this, more than half of physicians may skip over lifestyle change completely and jump straight to their prescription pad, doubting that cholesterol goals can be reached with lifestyle changes alone. According to the Director of the famous Framingham Heart Study (highlighted in my video, Barriers to Heart Disease Prevention), the best way to manage coronary artery disease is to lower patients’ LDL cholesterol and other atherosclerosis-causing particles. “You can achieve this with diet plus drugs, but if you can do it with a vegetarian diet, it works even better.” In the Framingham Heart Study, those running in the Boston Marathon achieved the goal of getting their total to good cholesterol ratio under four, but the vegetarians did even better. And if you go all out, putting people on a very high fiber, whole-food vegetable, fruit, and nut diet, you can get a 25 percent drop in the bad to good cholesterol ratio within one week and a 33 percent drop in LDL. That’s the cholesterol-reduction equivalent to a therapeutic dose of a cholesterol-lowering statin drug. Dr. Ornish talks about how diet can be more sustainable than drugs, since compliance is more based on love-of-life rather than fear-of-death. See his editorial in Convergence of Evidence. More on how lifestyle medicine is not only safer, and cheaper, but more effective: Many physicians just weren’t taught the power of diet: But there have been cases of the medical profession actively seeking to limit further nutrition training. See my series about a bill in California: Why not take drugs every day for the rest of our lives instead of using dietary change? That’s the question I ask in my video Fast Food: Do You Want Fries With That Lipitor? Plus, drugs may not be effective as we think. Check out: Why Prevention is Worth a Ton of Cure. Not only is that not treating the root cause, but there are potentially serious drug side-effects.

A-101	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/15/using-cherries-to-treat-gout/	Using Cherries to Treat Gout	Over the last 40 years, the burden of gout, a painful inflammatory arthritis, has risen considerably, now affecting millions of Americans. In fact, gout is now the most common inflammatory arthritis in men and older women. In my video, Gout Treatment with a Cherry on Top, I profiled new research, suggesting that even as few as a half of a cup of cherries a day may significantly lower the risk of gout attacks. Fresh cherries aren’t always in season, though. There are some alternatives. Frozen cherries appeared second-best and cherry juice concentrate is the runner-up. But does concentrated cherry juice actually help prevent attacks of gout? The first pilot study was a randomized controlled trial cherry juice concentrate with pomegranate juice concentrate as a control for the prevention of attacks in gout sufferers who were having as many as four attacks a month. The cherry group got a tablespoon of cherry juice concentrate twice a day for four months, and the control group got a tablespoon of pomegranate juice concentrate twice a day for four months. The number of gout flares in the cherry group dropped from an average of five down to two, better than the pomegranate group, which only dropped from about five to four. And about half of those in the cherry group who were on prescription anti-inflammatory drugs were able to stop their medications within two months after starting the cherry juice, as opposed to none of the patients in the pomegranate group. The second study, highlighted in my video, Treating Gout with Cherry Juice, was a retrospective investigation over a longer term. Twenty-four gout patients went from having about seven attacks a year, down to two. The researchers concluded that cherry juice concentrate is efficacious for the prevention of gout flares. Large, long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the usefulness of cherries and cherry juice concentrate for gout flare prophylaxis. So, are cherries now ripe for use as a complementary therapeutic in gout? One commentator “is of the opinion that the current state of evidence remains insufficient to formally recommend cherry fruit or cherry products as complementary therapeutic remedy for gout.” This commentator is also a paid consultant of nine different drug companies, all of which manufacture gout medications. I understand how the pharmaceutical industry can get nervous seeing studies where half of patients were able to stop taking their gout drugs given the billions of dollars at stake, but what’s the downside of eating a half cup of cherries a day, or worst comes to worst a few spoonfuls of cherry juice? Here are the other videos I’ve done on the power of cherries to control inflammation: Tart cherries (the kind people make pies out of, not the sweet kind) may also help with sleep (Tart Cherries for Insomnia). What do you do with frozen cherries? I just eat them straight—suck on them like popsicles, but they’re also an integral part of my Healthy Chocolate Milkshakes. Another way to help treat gout is to drink lots of water and keep one’s urine alkaline by eating lots of dark green leafy vegetables (see Testing Your Diet with Pee & Purple Cabbage). 	-	alternative medicine,arthritis,cherries,complementary medicine,frozen fruit,gout,industry influence,joint disease,joint health,juice,pomegranate juice,uric acid	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dried-fruit/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gout-with-cherry-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-chocolate-milkshakes/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gout-with-cherry-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tart-cherries-for-insomnia/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23023818,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334899,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-chocolate-milkshakes/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23023794,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/video/gout-treatment-with-a-cherry-on-top,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23416419,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21229414,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22653201,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-102	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/10/antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-in-meat/	Antibiotic-Resistant "Superbugs" in Meat	As a rule, “high-ranking public-health officials try to avoid apocalyptic descriptors. So, it’s worrying to hear those like the Director of the CDC warn of a coming health ‘nightmare’ and a ‘catastrophic threat.’” A number of prominent publications recently warned of the threat of antibiotic resistance. The CDC estimates that, at a minimum, more than two million people are sickened every year with antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States, with at least 23,000 dying as a result (See MRSA Superbugs in Meat). We may be at the dawn of a post-antibiotic era. Achievements in modern medicine that we today take for granted, such as surgery and the treatment of preterm babies, would not be possible without access to effective treatment for bacterial infections. For example, without antibiotics, the rate of postoperative infection after a procedure like a hip replacement would be 40-50% and about one in three of those patients would die. So, the so-called worst case scenarios where resistant infections could cost $50 billion a year might still be an underestimate. “From cradle to grave, antibiotics have become pivotal in safeguarding the overall health of human societies.” So, the dire phrasing from head officials may be warranted. There are now infections like carbapenem-resistant enterobacter that are resistant to nearly all antibiotics, even to so-called drugs of last resort. Worryingly, some of these last resort drugs are being used extensively in animal agriculture. According to the World Health Organization, more antibiotics are fed to farmed animals than are used to treat disease in human patients. Doctors overprescribe antibiotics, but huge amounts of antibiotics are used in fish farming and other intensive animal agriculture, up to four times the amount used in human medicine. Why? “Suboptimum growth to slaughter weight caused by unsanitary conditions can be compensated with the addition of antibiotics to feed.” Instead of relieving any stressful overcrowded unhygienic conditions, it may be cheaper to just dose the animals with drugs. In this way, factory farms are driving the growth of antibiotic-resistant organisms that cause human diseases. “This may help bolster the industry’s bottom line, but in the process, bacteria are developing antimicrobial resistance, which affects human health.” The FDA reports that 80% of antimicrobial drugs in the United States are used in food animals, mainly to promote growth in this kind of high-density production. This can select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staph aureus, or MRSA, considered a serious threat in the United States. These industrial pig operations may provide optimal conditions for the introduction and transmission of MRSA. U.S. pork producers are currently permitted to use 29 antibiotic drugs in feed—all without a prescription. Antibiotics are currently added to about 90% of pigs’ starter feeds. When animals receive unnecessary antibiotics, bacteria can become resistant to the drugs, then travel on meat to the store, and end up causing hard-to-treat illnesses in people. MRSA present in retail raw meat may serve as a possible source of bacterial infections of food preparers in the food industry and the hands of consumers in the home. Once MRSA gets into our homes on meat, it can transfer to our cutting boards, knives, and onto our skin at a rate similar to the rate of transmission from touching an infected patient contaminated with MRSA. Washing of hands after touching raw pork is advised. I know I’ve already covered this topic, but it never fails to shock me that the meat industry can get away with something so forcefully and universally condemned by the public health community. What other industrial sector could get away with putting people at such risk? It speaks to the combined might of the livestock industry and the pharmaceutical industry in holding sway over our democratic process, no matter what the human health consequences.

A-103	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/08/drugs-vs-lifestyle-for-preventing-diabetes/	Drugs vs. Lifestyle for Preventing Diabetes	In just one decade, the number of people with diabetes has more than doubled. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, by 2050, one out of every three of us may have diabetes. What’s the big deal? Well, the “consequences of diabetes are legion.” Diabetes is the number one cause of adult-onset blindness, the number one cause of kidney failure, and the number one cause of surgical amputations. What can we do to prevent it? The onset of Type 2 diabetes is gradual, with most individuals progressing through a state of prediabetes, a condition now striking approximately one in three Americans, but only about one in ten even knows they have it. Since current methods of treating diabetes remain inadequate, prevention is preferable, but what works better: lifestyle changes or drugs? We didn’t know until a landmark study, highlighted in my video, How to Prevent Prediabetes from Turning into Diabetes, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Thousands were randomized to get a double dose of the leading anti-diabetes drug, or diet and exercise. The drug, metformin, is probably the safest diabetes drug there is. It causes diarrhea in about half, makes one in four nauseous, about one in ten suffer from asthenia (physical weakness and fatigue), but only about 1 in 67,000 are killed by the drug every year. And the drug worked. Compared to placebo, in terms of the percentage of people developing diabetes within the four-year study period, fewer people in the drug group developed diabetes. But diet and exercise alone worked better. The lifestyle intervention reduced diabetes incidence by 58 percent, compared to only 31 percent with the drug. The lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than the drug, and had fewer side effects. More than three quarters of those on the drug reported gastrointestinal symptoms, though there was more muscle soreness reported in the lifestyle group, on account of them actually exercising. That’s what other studies have subsequently found: non-drug approaches are superior to drug-based approaches for diabetes prevention. And the average 50 percent or so drop in risk was just for those people instructed to improve their diet and lifestyle, whether or not they actually did it. In one of the most famous diabetes prevention studies, 500 people with prediabetes were randomized into a lifestyle intervention or control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by that same 50-60 percent, but only a fraction of the patients met the modest goals. Even in the lifestyle intervention group, only about a quarter were able to eat enough fiber, meaning whole, plant foods, and cut down on enough saturated fat, which in North America is mostly dairy, dessert, chicken and pork. But they did better than the control group, and fewer of them developed diabetes because of it. But what if you looked just at the folks that actually made the lifestyle changes? They had zero diabetes—none of them got diabetes. That’s effectively a 100 percent drop in risk. I often hear the diet and exercise intervention described as 60 percent effective. That’s still nearly twice as effective as the drug, but what the other study really showed is that it may be more like 100 percent in people who actually implement the diet and exercise intervention. So, is diet and exercise 100 percent effective or only 60 percent effective? On a population scale, since so many people won’t actually do it, it may only be 60 percent effective. But on an individual level, if you want to know what are the chances you won’t get diabetes if you change your lifestyle, then the 100 percent answer is more accurate. Lifestyle interventions only work when we do them. Kale is only healthy if it actually gets into our mouth. It’s not healthy just sitting on the shelf.   How about preventing prediabetes in the first place? See Preventing Prediabetes By Eating More and my video How to Prevent Prediabetes in Children. Some things we may want to avoid can be found in my videos Eggs and Diabetes and Fish and Diabetes. And what if we already have the disease?

A-104	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/03/how-to-prevent-childhood-obesity-and-diabetes/	How to Prevent Childhood Obesity & Diabetes	Thirty years ago, virtually all diabetes in young individuals was thought to be autoimmune Type 1 diabetes, but since the mid-90s, we started to see an increase in Type 2 diabetes among youth, particularly in the United States. Indeed, “the term adult onset diabetes has now been scrapped and replaced with ‘Type 2’ because children as young as eight are now developing the disease.” And the effects can be just as devastating. A 15-year follow-up of children diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes found an alarming rate in young adults of blindness, amputation, kidney failure and death in young adulthood. Why the dramatic rise in childhood diabetes? The dramatic rise in childhood diabetes is due to the dramatic rise in childhood obesity. During the past 30 years, the number of children diagnosed as being overweight has increased by more than 100 percent. Once an obese child reaches age six, it’s likely they’ll stay that way. And even if they don’t, being overweight in our youth predicts adult disease and death regardless of adult body weight. Being an overweight teen may predict disease risk 55 years later, including twice the risk of dying from heart attack, more cancer, gout, and arthritis. In fact being overweight as a teen “was a more powerful predictor of these risks then being overweight in adulthood.” This underscores the importance of focusing on preventing childhood obesity. How do we do it? From the official American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guidelines: the problem appears to be kids eating too much fat and added sugar, and not eating enough fruits and vegetables. Doctors, at every occasion beginning soon after a child’s birth, should endeavor to give sound advice regarding nutrition and growth so that obesity and its complications may be curtailed. What might sound advice sound like? The chair of the nutrition department at Loma Linda published a review suggesting not eating meat at all might be an effective strategy. Population studies have consistently shown that vegetarians are thinner than comparable non-vegetarians. In the largest such study to date (highlighted in my video How to Prevent Prediabetes in Children), a body mass index over 30 is considered obese, 25 to 30 overweight, and under 25 an ideal weight. The non-vegetarians were up at 28.8, showing the average meat-eater in the U.S. is significantly overweight. As one gets more and more plant-based, the average BMI drops. But even the average vegetarian in the U.S. is overweight. The only dietary group that was, on average, ideal weight were those eating strictly plant-based. It comes out to be about a 30-pound difference between average vegans and meat-eaters. In school-aged children, the consumption of animal foods (meats, dairy, or eggs) is associated with an increased risk of being overweight, whereas plant-based equivalents like veggie burgers, veggie dogs, and veggie cold cuts were not. The whole plant foods like grains, beans, and nuts were found to be protective. This may be because plant-based diets are low in energy density and high in starch, fiber, and water, which may increase feelings of fullness and resting energy expenditure, meaning resting metabolic rate. Eating plant-based appears to boost metabolism, such that you just burn more calories at rest. However, we’re not sure how much of the benefits are due to increased consumption of plant foods versus decreased consumption of meat. “Plant-based diets should be encouraged and promoted for optimal health. Local, national and international food policies are warranted to support social marketing messages and to reduce the social, cultural, economic and political forces that make it difficult to promote such diets.” For example, although the advice to consume a plant-based diet is sound, questions arise concerning the relatively high price of produce. We could reduce the burden of childhood obesity and prevent further spread of the disease, but we need to ensure that plant foods are affordable and accessible to children of all income levels. Getting diabetes in childhood cuts about 20 years of their life. What parent wouldn’t go to the ends of the Earth to add decades to their children’s lives? Fruits and vegetables may not fit on the Dollar Menu, but our kids are worth it. We make life and death decisions at the grocery store buying food for our family. It’s never too early to start our kids off on the right foot. See my video Heart Disease Starts in Childhood. And healthy doesn’t have to mean more expensive. Check out Eating Healthy on a Budget. For some tips on getting our kids to eat their vegetables, see my videos Tricks to Get Kids to Eat Healthier at School and Tricks to Get Kids to Eat Healthier at Home. Once one has prediabetes, there’s a way to prevent it from progressing further.

A-105	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-suspect-gluten-problems/	What To Do if You Suspect Gluten Problems	Symptoms of gluten sensitivity include irritable bowel type symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits, as well as systemic manifestations such as brain fog, headache, fatigue, depression, joint and muscle aches, numbness in the extremities, skin rash, or anemia. I previously discussed why people who suspect they might be gluten sensitive should not go on a gluten-free diet. But if that’s true, what should they do? The first thing is a formal evaluation for celiac disease, which currently involves blood tests and a small intestinal biopsy. If the evaluation is positive, then a gluten-free diet is necessary. If it’s negative, it’s best to try a healthier diet with more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans while avoiding processed junk. In the past, a gluten-free diet had many benefits over the traditional American diet because it required increasing fruit and vegetable intake—so no wonder people felt better eating gluten-free: no more unhealthy bread products, no more fast food restaurants. Now, there is just as much gluten-free junk out there. If a healthy diet doesn’t help, then the next step is to try ruling out other causes of chronic gastrointestinal distress. In a study of 84 people who claimed gluten caused them adverse reactions (they’re referred to in the literature as“PWAWGs,” People Who Avoid Wheat and/or Gluten), highlighted in my video, How to Diagnose Gluten Intolerance, about a third didn’t appear to have gluten sensitivity at all. Instead, they either had an overgrowth of bacteria in their small intestine, were fructose or lactose intolerant, or had a neuromuscular disorder like gastroparesis or pelvic floor dysfunction. Only if those are also ruled out, would I suggest people suffering from chronic suspicious symptoms try a gluten-free diet. If symptoms improve, stick with it and maybe re-challenge with gluten periodically. Unlike the treatment for celiac disease, a gluten-free diet for gluten sensitivity is ideal not only to prevent serious complications from an autoimmune reaction, but to resolve symptoms and try to improve a patient’s quality of life. However, a gluten-free diet itself can also reduce quality of life; so, it’s a matter of trying to continually strike the balance. For example, gluten-free foods can be expensive, averaging about triple the cost. Most people would benefit from buying an extra bunch of kale or blueberries instead. No current data suggest that that general population should maintain a gluten-free lifestyle, but for those with celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a sensitivity diagnosis, gluten-free diets can be a lifesaver.

A-106	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/23/how-a-gluten-free-diet-can-be-harmful/	How a Gluten-Free Diet Can Be Harmful	Until only a few years ago, almost the whole of the scientific world maintained that the wheat protein gluten would provoke negative effects only in people with rare conditions such as celiac disease or wheat allergies. But by the early part of 2013, it was largely becoming accepted that some non-celiac patients could suffer from gluten or wheat sensitivity. Indeed, a consensus panel of experts now officially recognizes three gluten-related conditions: wheat allergy, celiac disease, and gluten sensitivity. What percentage of the population should avoid wheat? About 1 in 1,000 may have a wheat allergy, and nearly 1 in 100 may have celiac disease. Celiac disease appears to be on the rise, though there’s still less than about a 1 in 10,000 chance an American will be diagnosed with celiac in a given year. Our best estimate for wheat sensitivity is in the same general range as celiac, slightly higher than 1 percent. That’s still potentially millions of people who may have been suffering for years who could have been cured by simple dietary means, yet who were unrecognized and unaided by the medical profession. Although gluten sensitivity continues to gain medical credibility, we still don’t know how it works. We don’t know how much gluten can be tolerated, if it’s reversible or not, or what the long-term complications might be of not sticking to a gluten-free diet. Considering the lack of knowledge, people with gluten sensitivity should consider reintroducing gluten back into their diet every year to see if it’s still causing problems. The reason health professionals don’t want to see people on gluten-free diets unless absolutely necessary is that, for the 98 percent of people that don’t have gluten issues, whole grains—including the gluten grains wheat, barley and rye—are health promoting, linked to reduced risk of coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases. Because some people have a peanut allergy doesn’t mean everyone should avoid peanuts. There is no evidence to suggest that following a gluten-free diet has any significant benefits in the general population. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that a gluten-free diet may adversely affect gut health in those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy. A study out of Spain, highlighted in my video, Gluten-Free Diets: Separating the Wheat from the Chat, found that a month on a gluten-free diet may hurt our gut flora and immune function, potentially setting those on gluten-free diets up for an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in their intestines. Why? Because the very components wheat sensitive people have problems with, like FODMAP and fructans, may act as prebiotics and feed our good bacteria. Gluten, itself, may also boost immune function. After less than a week on added gluten protein, subjects experienced significantly increased natural killer cell activity, which could be expected to improve our body’s ability to fight cancer and viral infections. Another study found that high gluten bread improved triglyceride levels better than regular gluten bread. Ironically, one of the greatest threats gluten-free diets pose may be the gluten itself. Self-prescription of gluten withdrawal may undermine our ability to detect celiac disease, the much more serious form of gluten intolerance. The way we diagnose celiac is by looking for the inflammation caused by gluten in celiac sufferers, but if they haven’t been eating a lot of gluten, we might miss the disease. Hence, rather than being on a gluten-free diet, we want celiac suspects to be on a gluten-loaded diet. We’re talking 4-6 slices of gluten packed bread every day for at least a month so we can definitively diagnose the disease. Why does it matter to get a formal diagnosis if you’re already on a gluten-free diet? Well, it’s a genetic disease, so you’ll know to test the family. But most importantly, many people on gluten-free diets are not actually on gluten-free diets. Even 20 parts per million can be toxic to someone with celiac. Many on “gluten-free diets” inadvertently eat gluten. Sometimes gluten-free products are contaminated; so, even foods labeled “gluten-free” may still not be safe for celiac sufferers. As editorialized in The Lancet, the irony of many celiac patients not knowing their diagnosis, while millions of non-sufferers banish gluten from their lives, can be considered a public health farce.   Though the medical profession now recognizes wheat sensitivity as a discrete entity, it’s still not clear if it’s actually the gluten to which people are reacting. For a review of the controversy, see Is Gluten Sensitivity Real? In How to Diagnose Gluten Intolerance, I go step by step how someone may want to proceed who suspects they might be sensitive to gluten-containing grains.

A-107	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/18/gluten-sensitivity-put-to-the-test/	Gluten Sensitivity Put to the Test	In 1980, researchers in England reported a series of women with no evidence of celiac disease (the autoimmune disorder associated with gluten intolerance), who nevertheless resolved their chronic diarrhea on a gluten-free diet. The medical profession was skeptical at the time that non-celiac gluten sensitivity existed, and even 30 years later, such patients were commonly referred to psychiatrists. Psychological testing of such patients, however, found no evidence that they were suffering from any kind of psychosomatic hysteria. The medical profession has a history of dismissing diseases as all in people’s heads—post-traumatic stress disorder, ulcerative colitis, migraines, ulcers, asthma, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Despite resistance from the prevailing medical community at the time, these health problems have subsequently been confirmed to be credible physiologically-based disorders rather than psychologically-based confabulations. On the flip side, the internet is rife with unsubstantiated claims about gluten free diets, which have spilled over into the popular press to make gluten the diet villain du jour, with claims like “17 million Americans are gluten sensitive.” However, it must be remembered that the gluten-free food industry is a big business. When literally billions are at stake, it’s hard to trust anybody. As always, it’s best to stick to the science. What sort of evidence do we have for the existence of a condition presumed to be so widespread? Not much. The evidence base for such claims has been unfortunately very thin because we haven’t had randomized controlled trials demonstrating that the entity even exists. The gold-standard for confirming non-celiac gluten sensitivity requires a gluten-free diet, followed by a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled food challenge. For example, give people a muffin and don’t tell them if it’s gluten-free or gluten-filled—to control for placebo effects—and see what happens. The reason this is necessary is because when you actually do this, a number of quote-unquote “gluten-sensitive” patients don’t react at all to disguised gluten and instead react to the gluten-free placebo. We never had that level of evidence until 2011, when a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was published, which tested to see if patients complaining of irritable bowel symptoms who claimed they felt better on a gluten free diet—despite not having celiac disease—actually could tell if they were given gluten containing bread and muffins or gluten-free bread and muffins. Subjects started out gluten-free and symptom-free for two weeks and then were challenged with the bread and muffins. In my video, Is Gluten Sensitivity Real?, you can see what happened to the 15 patients who got the placebo, meaning they started out on a gluten-free diet and continued on a gluten-free diet. They got worse. Just the thought that they may be eating something that was bad for them made them feel crampy and bloated. This is what’s called the nocebo effect. The placebo effect is when you give someone something useless and they feel better; the nocebo effect is when you give someone something harmless and they feel worse. On the other hand, the small group that got the actual gluten, felt even worse still. The researchers concluded that non-celiac gluten intolerance may therefore indeed exist. It was a small study, though, and even though the researchers claimed the gluten-free bread and muffins were indistinguishable, maybe at some level the patients could tell which was which. So, in 2012, researchers in Italy took 920 patients that had been diagnosed with non-celiac gluten sensitivity and put them to the test with a double-blinded wheat challenge by giving them capsules filled with wheat flour or filled with placebo powder. More than two-thirds failed the test, such as getting worse on the placebo or better on the wheat. But of those that passed, there was a clear benefit to staying on the wheat-free diet. The researchers concluded that their findings confirmed the existence of a non-celiac wheat sensitivity. Note I said “wheat sensitivity,” not “gluten sensitivity.” Gluten itself may not be causing gut symptoms at all. Most people with wheat sensitivity have a variety of other food sensitivities. Two thirds are sensitive to cow’s milk protein, and many are sensitive to eggs. If we put people on a diet low in common triggers of irritable bowel symptoms, and then challenge them with gluten, there’s no effect. We find the same increase in symptoms with high gluten, low gluten, or no gluten diets, calling into question the very existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Interestingly, despite being informed that avoiding gluten didn’t seem to do a thing for their gut symptoms, many participants opted to continue following a gluten-free diet as they subjectively described “feeling better.” So, researchers wondered if avoiding gluten might improve the mood of those with wheat sensitivity. Indeed, short-term exposure to gluten appeared to induce feelings of depression in these patients. Whether non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a disease of the mind or the gut, it is no longer a condition that can be dismissed.   More than 10,000 articles have been published on gluten in medical journals—intimidating even for me! Combined with the multi-billion dollar financial interests on both sides, it makes for a difficult task. But I think I did it! This is the first of a 3-part series summarizing the best available science on gluten. Also check out: Gluten-Free Diets: Separating the Wheat from the Chat and How to Diagnose Gluten Intolerance. Why this apparent increase in food sensitivities in recent decades? It could be because of pollutant exposure (see Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies and Dietary Sources of Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors). What can we do about preventing so-called atopic diseases (like allergies, asthma, and eczema)? See my videos Preventing Allergies in Adulthood and Preventing Allergies in Childhood. The weirdest example of an emerging food sensitivity may be the tick-bite related meat allergy story I review in Alpha Gal and the Lone Star Tick and Tick Bites, Meat Allergies, and Chronic Urticaria. 	-	allergies,asthma,bagels,bread,celiac disease,dairy,depression,diarrhea,eggs,FODMAPs,food sensitivities,fructans,gluten,grains,industry influence,irritable bowel syndrome,mental health,migraines,milk,mood,multiple sclerosis,Parkinson’s disease,pasta,stomach ulcers,ulcerative colitis,United Kingdom,wheat	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tick-bites-meat-allergies-and-chronic-urticaria/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alpha-gal-and-the-lone-star-tick/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-sensitivity-real/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23937528,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22281277,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alpha-gal-and-the-lone-star-tick/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22825366,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23204002,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533607,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-gluten-sensitivity-real/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351716,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7419003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20920818,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tick-bites-meat-allergies-and-chronic-urticaria/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22519894,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689456,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21224837,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-diagnose-gluten-intolerance,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&term=gluten,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gluten-free-diets-separating-the-wheat-from-the-chat	
A-108	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/16/should-we-take-chlorella-to-boost-natural-killer-cell-activity/	Should We Take Chlorella to Boost Natural Killer Cell Activity?	Multiple studies published over the last few decades suggest that exercise can mitigate the decline in immune function as we age. Exercising can boost the activity of natural killer cells, our immune soldiers that focus on eliminating both tumor cells and virus-infected cells. In my video, Treating Hepatits C with Chlorella, you can see the clear difference in natural killer cell activity between women involved in athletic competitions and their sedentary counterparts. There is a growing consensus that natural killers appear to be the immune system component that is most responsive to the exercise across the board, in populations ranging from older women to younger men. Even just moderate exercise, such as daily walking, appears to significantly improve natural killer cell activity within six weeks. This may be why exercise helps protect against cancer. On the other hand, sustained, vigorous exercise may actually impair natural killer cell immunity, which may be one reason endurance athletes like marathon runners appear more likely to get upper respiratory tract infections. But could there be a natural solution? Petri dish and animal studies have suggested that the green algae chlorella can affect natural killer cell activity. However, there was no direct evidence for the effect of chlorella supplementation in humans, until a South Korean randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial gave subjects about two teaspoons of chlorella a day for eight weeks. Compared to placebo, those getting chlorella had a significant increase in natural killer cell activity. Do these results actually translate into clinical benefits? It is estimated that up to four million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis C virus infection, the leading cause of liver transplants, estimated to kill a quarter million Americans this decade. The current treatment is costly and brutal, costing up to $85,000, and nearly half can’t even complete the treatment, due in part to the many complications associated with the treatment. That’s why there’s such a need for novel treatment options. A study out of the World Journal of Gastroenterology put chlorella to the test for chronic hepatitis C. After three months of chlorella, subjects reported improvements in quality of life, but that could have just been a placebo effect since the control group wasn’t given green sugar pills. However, a significant improvement in ALT is harder to explain. ALT is a marker of liver inflammation, and improvements in ALT could be explained by a beneficial immunostimulatory effect of chlorella supplementation. No serious adverse effects were reported in the study; so, why not give chlorella a try? Well, the brand the researchers used, Sun Chlorella, was tied to a disturbing case report. A 48-year old woman in Omaha suffered a psychotic break, out of the blue, two months after starting chlorella. Physicians stopped it and started her on an antipsychotic drug, and a week later she was fine. Chlorella has never been linked to psychosis before; so, presumably it was just a coincidence that the psychosis started after she started taking chlorella, and the reason she felt better after stopping it was because the drug was kicking in. But seven weeks later, still on the drug, she became psychotic again after starting back on the chlorella. They stopped the chlorella again—this time that’s all they did—and the psychosis resolved. Maybe it wasn’t the chlorella itself, but some toxic impurity or adulteration? We don’t know. While chlorella is marketed to promote mental health, this case underscores the importance of educating the public about the potential adverse effects and the need for more research in herbal products being marketed in the United States. That psychosis case report makes me nervous. Unlike blue-green algae, which can produce neurotoxins (Is Blue-Green Algae Good for You?), chlorella does not (Is Chlorella Good for you?), but neither does spirulina; yet, toxins have been found in spirulina supplements, presumably due to contaminants (Another Update on Spirulina). There are other ways to counter the impact of over-strenuous exercise.

A-109	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/11/a-simple-yet-neglected-cure-for-childhood-constipation/	A Simple Yet Neglected Cure for Childhood Constipation	Back in the 1950s, it was suggested that some cases of constipation among children might be due to the consumption of cow’s milk. But it wasn’t until 40 years later that it was finally put to the test. We used to think that most chronic constipation in infants and young children was all in their head—they were “anal retentive”—or had some intestinal disorder, but a group of Italian researchers studied 27 consecutive infants who showed up in their pediatric gastroenterology clinic with chronic “idiopathic constipation” (meaning they had no idea what was causing it), and tried removing cow’s milk protein from their diet. Within three days on a cow’s milk protein-free diet, 21 out of the 27 children were cured. There were clinical relapses during two subsequent cow milk challenges, meaning when they tried giving the children back some cow’s milk,  the constipation reappeared within 24 to 48 hours. The subjects came back after a month and stayed cured, and their eczema and wheezing went away, too! The researchers concluded that many cases of chronic constipation in young children—more than three quarters it seemed, may be due to an underlying cow’s milk protein allergy. Chronic constipation is a common problem in children, for which fiber and laxatives are prescribed. If those don’t work, several laxatives at progressively higher dosages can be used, and that still may not work. Five years later, a considerable number of kids are still suffering. In fact, chronic constipation may even extend into adulthood. To cure the disease in just a few days by eliminating cow’s milk was a real breakthrough. But it was an open trial, meaning not blinded or placebo-controlled. We didn’t have such a trial until a landmark study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine—a double-blind, crossover study, comparing cow’s milk and soy milk. The study enrolled 65 kids suffering from chronic constipation, all previously treated unsuccessfully with laxatives; 49 had anal fissures and inflammation and swelling. The researchers gave them either cow’s milk or soy milk for two weeks and then switched it around. In two thirds of the children, constipation resolved while they were receiving soy milk, and the anal fissures and pain were cured. None of the children receiving cow’s milk had a positive response. In the 44 responders, the relation with cow’s milk protein hypersensitivity was confirmed in all cases by a double-blind challenge with cow’s milk. All those lesions, including the most severe anal fissures, disappeared on a cow’s milk-free diet, yet reappeared within days after the reintroduction of cow’s milk back into their diets. This may explain why children drinking more than a cup of milk a day may have eight times the odds of developing anal fissures. Cutting out milk may help cure anal fissures in adults, too. Cow’s milk may also be a major contributor to recurrent diaper rash as well. Why does removing cow’s milk treat these conditions? Studies that have looked at biopsy tissue samples in patients with chronic constipation because of cow’s milk protein hypersensitivity have found signs of rectal inflammation, suggesting that cow’s milk protein was inducing an inflammatory response. Studies from around the world have subsequently confirmed these findings, curing up to 80 percent of kids’ constipation by switching to soy milk or rice milk. A common problem with the studies, though, is when they switched kids from cow’s milk to non-dairy milk, the kids could still have been eating other dairy products. That is, they didn’t control the background diet…until recently. A 2013 study (highlighted in my video, Childhood Constipation and Cow’s Milk, got constipated kids off all dairy products and 100 percent were cured, compared with 68 percent in the New England Journal study. Isn’t this amazing? I just kept thinking, “why didn’t I learn this in medical school?” Is the dairy lobby so persuasive that a cheap, simple, safe, life-changing intervention like this remains buried? Until now!

A-110	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/	How to Cook Broccoli	When I used to teach medical students at Tufts, I gave a lecture about this amazing new therapeutic called “iloccor-B.” I’d talk about all the new science, all the things it could do, its excellent safety profile. Just as they were all scrambling to buy stock in the company and prescribe it to all their patients, I’d do the big reveal. Apologizing for my “dyslexia,” I would admit that I’d got it backwards. All this time I had been talking about broccoli. The main active ingredient in broccoli is thought to be sulforaphane, which may protect our brains, protect our eyesight, protect our bodies against free radicals, boost our detoxification enzymes, and help prevent and treat cancer. In my videos The Best Detox and  Sometimes the Enzyme Myth is the Truth, I talked about how the formation of sulforaphane is like a chemical flare reaction, requiring the mixing of a precursor compound with an enzyme, which is destroyed by cooking. This may explain why we get dramatic suppression of cancer cell growth from raw broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, but hardly anything from boiled, microwaved or steamed (except for microwaved broccoli, which actually retains some cancer fighting abilities). But who wants to eat raw Brussels sprouts? There is a strategy to get the benefits of raw in cooked form. In raw broccoli, the sulforaphane precursor, called glucoraphanin, mixes with the enzyme (myrosinase) when you chew or chop it. If given enough time—such as when sitting in your upper stomach waiting to get digested—sulforaphane is born. The precursor and sulforaphane are resistant to heat and therefore cooking, but the enzyme is destroyed. No enzyme = no sulforaphane. That’s why I described the “hack and hold” technique—if we chop the broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, collards, or cauliflower first and then wait 40 minutes, we can cook them all we want. The sulforaphane is already made; the enzyme has already done its job, so we don’t need it anymore. When most people make broccoli soup, for example, they’re doing it wrong. Most people cook the broccoli first, then blend it. We now know it should be done the exact opposite way. Blend it first, wait, and then cook it. What if we’re using frozen broccoli, though? In my video, Second Strategy to Cooking Broccoli, you can see the amount of sulforaphane in someone’s body after they eat broccoli soup made from fresh broccoli versus from frozen broccoli. The difference is dramatic. Commercially produced frozen broccoli lacks the ability to form sulforaphane because vegetables are blanched (flash-cooked) before they’re frozen for the very purpose of deactivating enzymes. This prolongs shelf life in the frozen foods section, but the myrosinase is dead by the time you take it out of your freezer. It doesn’t matter how much you chop it, or how long you wait, no sulforaphane is going to be made. This may be why fresh kale suppresses cancer cell growth up to ten times more than frozen. The frozen broccoli is still packed with the precursor—remember that’s heat resistant—and we could get lots of sulforaphane out of the frozen broccoli by adding some outside enzyme. Where do we get myrosinase enzyme from? Researchers just buy theirs from a chemical company. But we can just walk into any grocery store. All cruciferous vegetables have this myrosinase. Mustard greens, a cruciferous vegetable, grow out of little mustard seeds, which we can buy ground up in the spice aisle as mustard powder. If we sprinkled some mustard powder on our cooked frozen broccoli, would it start churning out sulforaphane? We didn’t know…until now. Boiling broccoli prevents the formation of any significant levels of sulforaphane due to inactivation of the enzyme. However, researchers from the University of Reading found that the addition of powdered mustard seeds to the heat processed broccoli significantly increased the formation of sulforaphane. In the video I mentioned earlier, Second Strategy to Cooking Broccoli, you can see the amount of sulforaphane in boiled broccoli versus the amount after half a teaspoon or a teaspoon of mustard powder is added. Both a half teaspoon and a full teaspoon increase sulforaphane by the same amount, suggesting that we could use even use less mustard powder for the same effect. Therefore, although domestic cooking leads to the deactivation of myrosinase and stops sulforaphane formation, the addition of powdered mustard seeds to cooked cabbage-family vegetables provides a natural source of the enzyme such that it’s practically like eating them raw. So, if we forget to chop our greens in the morning for the day, or are using frozen, we can just sprinkle some mustard powder on top at the dinner table and we’re all set. Daikon radish, horseradish, or wasabi—all cruciferous vegetables packed with the enzyme—work as well. Just a quarter teaspoon of Daikon radish root for seven cups of broccoli worked—just a tiny pinch can do it. Or you can add a small amount of fresh greens to your cooked greens, because the fresh greens have myrosinase enzyme that can go to work on the cooked greens. I love kitchen chemistry—it totally revolutionized my daily greens prep. One of the first things I used to do in the morning is chop my greens for the day, so when lunch and supper rolls around they’d be good to go. But now with the mustard powder plan, I don’t have to pre-chop. This helps explain the results I presented in Raw Broccoli and Bladder Cancer Survival.

A-111	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/04/our-star-volunteers/	Our Star Volunteers	2016 marks the 5-year anniversary of NutritionFacts.org—time flies when you’re having fun! New features continue to be added. Did you see the new Trending Topics section in the upper left corner of the home page? If you click on any of those, you’ll see a list of our top ten or so videos within each category to highlight the most popular ones. When I started the site this wasn’t necessary, but now that there are more than 1,000 videos, this new feature will hopefully help those new to the site navigate directly to some of the most compelling content.   The reason we’ve been able to thrive is because of our dear supporters, who have donated their time and money to grow NutritionFacts.org into the global resource it is today. Do you know we have 72 active volunteers? If you would like to be one, we have two new groups of volunteer positions now available at http://nutritionfacts.org/volunteer/ If you think you’d be a good fit, please fill out an application, and if not, please check back as we add more positions. I’ve asked some of our most amazingly dedicated volunteer all-stars to introduce themselves: Jennifer Drost I’ve worked for the last 12 years as a Physician Assistant at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. Several years ago, a patient stumped me with a question about which diet was the healthiest. Although I did get one hour of nutrition training during my PA training at Yale, I had no idea. Luckily,  I stumbled across NutritionFacts.org and fell in love with the evidence-based site with its thousands of peer-reviewed journal papers. Inspired by finding this non-commercial, not-for-profit goldmine of nutrition goodness, I knew I wanted to help however I could​. ​My favorite part of volunteering is helping people find videos specific to their questions. With more than 1,000 videos on the site, the answers to most of our questions are there. Brad Longworth I’m a 52 year old software developer by day and became a vegan 7.5 years ago after reading “The China Study.” About 6 years ago, a local vegetarian society was advertising a talk by Dr. Greger and of course I wanted to learn about the latest in nutrition research, so I went. This annual talk and Dr. Greger’s website turned out to be an invaluable resource, so I offered to help. I’m always ready when Katie or Tommasina come calling, but I also enjoy choral singing and have been in a choir since I was 8 years old. Thea I have been helping people in the comments sections of NutritionFacts.org from the very beginning of the site. My top goal is making the comments area a supportive place and full of high level civil discourse. If I had to describe it succinctly, I would say I am trying to build community. I also have a passion for animal training.​ ​ Robin D. Everson​ As a food and wine journalist, my diet was not conducive to good health. I had Type 2 diabetes and a host of other health issues. After meeting Dr. Greger and adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet, I saw my health improve overnight. My blood glucose levels dropped 100 points within the first week, and I lost 15 pounds within the first three weeks. I am happy to be diabetes free. I enjoy being part of the NutritionFacts.org team and helping moderate the site’s social media. It is great interacting with so many people that want to know how to improve their health and the health of their loved ones. My biggest joy is when someone reports back that they have watched the videos and are now reaping the benefits of a healthy, plant-based diet. Barb Leable I’m happy to close caption videos for NutritionFacts.org for several reasons. One, selfishly, is that working on the captions helps me to focus personally on the benefits of a plant-based diet, so I tend to eat more fruits and veggies. On a broader scale, I think the lessons from Dr. Greger’s videos are critical so everyone in the world can gain the knowledge to optimize their health, which will help constrain out-of-control healthcare costs as Baby Boomers, like me, age.​ Arlene Guccione Volunteering for NutritionFacts.org keeps me on the leading edge of life! NutritionFacts.org exposes me to an immense source of nutrition studies brilliantly distilled into thought-provoking soundbites by Dr. Greger and his team. I am so thankful I can be a small utensil as a captioner as well as a coordinator of foreign translations. Assisting eager translators reminds me that I belong to an expanding global community of Earth-friendly individuals who love and respect all living beings. Dianne Moore Plant-based nutrition has saved my life. By 2004, I had unhealthily lost over 150 pounds, but knew if I didn’t completely change my diet, I would once again gain the weight. NutritionFacts.org has been a lifeline and a gold mine for me. Dr. Greger’s videos allowed me to eat smart, getting me off of four out of five of my prescriptions, and eliminating my high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and migraines. Impressed by Dr. Greger and his giving spirit, I wanted to support NutritionFacts.org so it would remain a vital presence of sound research of plant-based nutrition for others. I’ve been volunteering for years, and currently help uploading the videos to the site. Additionally, I established a monthly gift to NutritionFacts.org so it might continue to educate and assist others. Lydia Paterson I am a media professional based in Brooklyn, NY. I got my start volunteering at Nutritionfacts.org while living in Washington, DC and working at National Geographic. I currently work at Shutterstock and am passionate about healthy eating. My volunteer role is to do YouTube editing for NutritionFacts.org, helping to upload the videos that inspired me to volunteer. Rob Dvorak About four years ago, a family illness had me re-examine my lifestyle and diet. After being pointed to NutritionFacts.org and watching many documentaries, I made the choice to follow a plant-based diet and never looked back! Besides helping out with NF, I enjoy playing tennis and volleyball, getting into Spartan racing, baking, trying new restaurants, and going to DC Vegfest! Cooper Walter I began volunteering with Dr. Greger in 2012 as a high school junior. My family and I are committed to a whole foods, plant based diet and are deeply grateful for what Dr. Greger does with NutritionFacts.org. I am now a premed student at Cornell University and someday hope to become an M.D. who helps prevent and heal disease with food and lifestyle modification. I edit some of Dr. Greger’s blogs and enjoy being part of a team of people who contribute to this important work. Rami Najjar I stumbled upon NutritionFacts.org in early 2011, and decided to volunteer later that year because I believed in NutritionFacts.org, as it was and is the only open source, science-based nutrition website with easy-to-understand nutrition videos using accurately interpreted studies, not opinions. This incredible volunteer experience sparked a fire within me for research. I am currently a Master’s student at Texas Woman’s University in Houston, studying nutrition and aiming for a PhD to be a nutrition researcher. My life passion outside of nutrition is rock climbing. Lauren Hacker A software engineer who has worked for Lockheed Martin and IBM, I love to find solutions to technical problems in ways that empower others. A native of the Big Apple, I have lived in the Big Peach with my husband, Mike, since the 1990’s. Together we started on a path of personal and environmental wellness that naturally led to a plant-based lifestyle, and to NutritionFacts.org. Helping my favorite non-profit find and implement technical solutions to improve operations has been a real joy for me! Kari Zamora I’m a software engineer with a passion for nutrition, animal rights, and languages. After moving to Seattle from Mexico, I started looking for volunteering opportunities and was fortunate to find one with NutritionFacts.org where I collaborate to solve technical problems and propose new ideas to improve our daily work. It’s been a very rewarding experience to volunteer for a kind, smart, and talented group of people. Hadley Johnson Working with NutritionFacts.org is the most rewarding way to show people how easy it can be to live life to the fullest in health. I am in graduate school completing my Masters in Wholistic Nutrition, Mindfulness, and Public Advocacy. In addition to whole plant foods, I enjoy practicing yoga, going to museums, sketching, reading, writing, spending time at the beach and most of all enjoying time with the people I care about. Laura Race I’m a 23 year old from Sydney, Australia. After completing a Masters in Health Communication in late 2014, I jumped at the position of Social Media Intern and have been fortunate enough to work with NutritionFacts.org over the last year. I am passionate about my role in this organisation because I believe that improving health literacy and advocating the health benefits of a plant-based diet are supremely important in public health promotion. There is also the potential to dissuade people from eating animal products, which in turn reduces environmental destruction and animal suffering.     How Not to Die just slipped back onto the New York Times Bestseller list, nearly two months after publication! Here’s my favorite endorsement of the month, from the Father of lifestyle medicine himself: “The primary determinant of our health and well-being is what we eat and how we live. In this extraordinary and empowering book, Dr. Michael Greger explains why. Highly recommended.” -Dean Ornish, M.D. author, The Spectrum and Dr. Dean Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/book-trailer-for-how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/volunteer/,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Robin.jpg,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Cooper.png,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Kari.png,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/04130030/Hadley.jpg,http://nutritionfacts.org/,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Jen.jpg,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Arlene.jpg,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/04130030/Rami1.png,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Brad.jpg,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Barb.jpg,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Rob.jpg,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/lydia.jpg,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/04130030/Dianne.jpg,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/book-trailer-for-how-not-to-die/,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/04130030/Lauren.jpg,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/	
A-112	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/02/the-number-one-global-diet-risk/	The #1 Dietary Risk Factor is Not Eating Enough Fruit	The Global Burden of Disease Study published in 2012, is the most comprehensive and systematic analysis of causes of death undertaken to date, involving nearly 500 researchers from more than 300 institutions in 50 countries, and starting with almost 100,000 data sources. What did the researchers find? Here in the U.S., they determined that our biggest killer was our diet. Number 1 on their list of the most important dietary risks was not eating enough fruit, responsible for an estimated 4.9 million deaths a year around the world. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists: “If Americans ate just one more serving of fruits or vegetables per day, this would save more than 30,000 lives and $5 billion in medical costs each year.” One antidote for individuals is easy, painless, and even pleasurable: exploit the multiple nutritional and protective benefits of fruits and vegetables. One way plants protect us may be their antiplatelet effects. Platelets are what trigger the blood clots that cause heart attacks and most strokes. And beyond their obvious function in blood clotting, platelets are now considered to play a pivotal inflammatory role in the hardening of the arteries in the first place, and in allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, and even cancer. Normally, under healthy conditions, platelets circulate in a quiescent, inactive state. But once they become activated, they can emerge as culprits in inflammation. Platelets transport a vast amount of inflammatory chemicals, and upon activation they release these chemicals, which can recruit the inflammatory cells that form the pus pockets within our arterial walls that can eventually burst and kill us. This involvement of platelet activation in atherosclerosis development is well established. We’ve long recognized the platelets’ role in the final stages; however, a growing body of data indicates that platelets may also play an important role in the initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis in the first place. How can we prevent the excessive activation of platelets? It’s generally recognized that platelet hyper-reactivity is associated with high levels of cholesterol circulating in the blood; so we can cut down on foods that have trans fats, saturated fats, and dietary cholesterol. We can also eat more fruits and vegetables. For example, different varieties of strawberries have shown a significant antiplatelet effect in a petri dish and in people. How did researchers figure it out? In my video, Inhibiting Platelet Aggregation with Berries, you can see a platelet in a resting state, packed with little round granule grenades of inflammatory chemicals, which fuse together and are released when the platelet gets activated. Because resting and activated platelets look so different, we can just take blood from people and count how many are resting and how many are activated before and after people eat more than a pint of strawberries every day for a month. From just adding strawberries to people’s diets, there’s a small but significant drop in the percentage of activated platelets circulating throughout their bodies. Other berries had a similar effect, even at a more modest two servings a day. Drinking orange or grapefruit juice doesn’t seem to help, but purple grape juice successfully reduces platelet activity on the same order that aspirin does. Studies have shown that daily aspirin can reduce heart attacks and strokes; however, aspirin can also cause severe gastrointestinal disturbances and bleeding problems, and so should not be used for the primary prevention of heart attacks and stroke as the benefits don’t clearly outweigh the serious risks. It’s nice to have safe, side-effect free alternatives. One of the ways plants help keep platelets in their place may actually be their aspirin content! See Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods. Why would a plant make a human drug? It’s so cool, check out Appropriating Plant Defenses. Is the Standard American Diet really so bad that we could save 100,000 people by just getting up to minimum fruit and veggie recommendations? Even cynics might be surprised: Nation’s Diet in Crisis. Even more plants may cut deaths even more, though. See One in a Thousand: Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic. For more on lowering cholesterol see my video Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. And it’s never too early to start eating healthier. Check out: Heart Disease Starts in Childhood. Heart disease may be a choice. See: Cavities and Coronaries: Our Choice. Berries are the healthiest fruits, shown to maintain our brain power (How to Slow Brain Aging By Two Years) and improve our immune function (Boosting Natural Killer Cell Activity).

A-113	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/26/why-are-chickens-fed-prozac/	Why are Chickens Fed Prozac?	Between 1940 and 1971, the synthetic estrogen DES was prescribed to several million pregnant women with the promise that it would “help prevent miscarriages.” Problems were first highlighted in 1953 when it became clear that DES was not only ineffective but potentially harmful. However, a powerful and emotive advertising campaign ensured that its use continued until 1971, when it was found to cause cancer of the vagina in the daughters of the mothers who took it. DES was also used to stunt the growth of girls who were predicted to grow “abnormally tall.” As one pediatric textbook put it in 1968, “excessive tallness in girls can be a handicap … it provides difficulty in the purchase of smart clothes; the victim is ineligible for certain sought-after professional positions such as air line hostess; and poses problems in selecting suitable dancing partners.” What most people don’t know is that the greatest usage of DES was by the livestock industry, used to improve “feed conversion” in cattle and chickens. Within a year of approval, DES was fed to millions of farm animals. Although it was shown to be a human carcinogen in 1971, DES used in meat production was not completely banned until 1979. (Now, the meat industry just uses different synthetic estrogen implants.) Even decades after DES was banned, we’re still seeing its effects—an elevation of birth defects even down to the third generation. Arsenic is another human carcinogen that was fed to chickens. This time by the billions. The arsenic not only ends up in the meat (as I’ve talked about previously in Arsenic in Chicken and How Many Cancers Caused by Arsenic Laced Chicken?), but also in the feathers, which are fed back to the animals. Because a third of the bird is inedible, the industry takes billions of pounds of heads, bones, guts, and feathers and uses them as fertilizer and animal feed. This feather meal is fed back to chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, and fish. Straight feathers are not particularly nutritious; so guts, heads, and feet may be added for a little extra protein, and manure added for minerals. The problem is that feather meal used as animal feed could contribute to additional arsenic exposure in persons who consume meat. This gave researchers at John Hopkins University and Arizona State an idea. By testing feather meal, they might be able to find out what else chickens are fed. In their study, “Feather Meal: A Previously Unrecognized Route for Reentry into the Food Supply of Multiple Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products,” (highlighted in my video, Illegal Drugs in Chicken Feathers) they found that all feather samples tested positive for antibiotic type drugs (between two and ten different kinds in each sample), including fluoroquinolones, which have been banned for years. Either the poultry industry is illegally still using the stuff, or it’s being used in other animals fed to the chicken. Regardless, when feather meal is fed back to chickens, they are getting exposed to this drug that is against the law to feed to chickens, creating a cycle of re-exposure to banned drugs. Then it just gets weirder. The feathers contained a half dozen other drugs: Prozac, an antihistamine, a fungicide, a sex hormone, and caffeine. Why doesn’t the poultry industry just say no? Evidently, the antihistamines are to combat the respiratory problems from packing so many tens of thousands into the confinement sheds, and the caffeine helps keeps the chickens stay awake so they eat more and grow faster. The drugs fed to chickens are one reason used to explain why poultry has been tied to increased cancer risk. See Chicken Dioxins, Viruses, or Antibiotics?. The most concerning drugs currently in the U.S. poultry supply are the antibiotics, though. See, for example: Ironically, not only may antibiotics in chicken contribute to antibiotic resistant infections, but to the infections in the first place. Check out my video Avoiding Chicken to Avoid Bladder Infections. Then as if adding potentially harmful chemicals to the chickens themselves wasn’t bad enough, more are added in the processing plant: Phosphate Additives in Chicken. 	-	animal protein,antibiotics,antihistamines,arsenic,birth defects,caffeine,cancer,carcinogens,chicken,DES,drug residues,estrogen,factory farming practices,farm animals,feather meal,feed additives,fish,fungicides,growth promoters,hormones,industry influence,medications,miscarriage,poultry,pregnancy,prozac,sheep,turkey,vaginal cancer,vaginal health,women's health	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20678835,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22464649,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es203970e,http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jo-Anne_Rayner2/publication/45460983_The_medicalisation_of_%27tall%27_girls_A_discourse_analysis_of_medical_literature_on_the_use_of_synthetic_oestrogen_to_reduce_female_height/links/551b11de0cf251c35b504fd1.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5549830,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/illegal-drugs-in-chicken-feathers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22244353	
A-114	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/21/making-your-own-mouthwash/	Making Your Own Mouthwash	The effects of a vegetarian diet on systemic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart diseases have been studied and have revealed predominantly less systemic diseases in those eating plant-based diets. However, there have only been a few studies on oral health, which I covered in my videos Plant-Based Diets: Oral Health and Plant-Based Diets: Dental Health. What’s the latest? In a study of 100 vegetarians compared to a 100 non-vegetarians, the vegetarians had better periodontal conditions, showing less signs of inflammation like gum bleeding, less periodontal damage, and better dental home care, brushing and flossing 2.17 times a day compared to 2.02 times a day. The difference in home hygiene is not that large, though, so maybe it was something about their diet. However, vegetarians may have a healthier lifestyle overall beyond just avoiding meat. The researchers controlled for smoking, but other factors like obesity can adversely affect oral health, so there may be confounding factors. What we need is an interventional study, where researchers take people eating the standard Western diet, improve their diets, and see what happens. But no such study existed… until now. With professional support of nutritionists, the participants of the study (highlighted in my video What’s the Best Mouthwash?) with existing periodontal disease changed their dietary patterns to so-called “wholesome nutrition,” a diet emphasizing veggies, fruits, whole grains, potatoes, beans, peas, lentils, and spices, with water as the preferred beverage. To make sure any changes they witnessed were due to the diet, researchers made subjects maintain their same oral hygiene before and after the dietary change. What did they find? They found that eating healthier appeared to lead to a significant reduction of probing pocket depth, gingival inflammation, and levels of inflammatory cytokines, which mediate the tissue destruction in periodontal disease. Therefore, the researchers conclude that wholesome nutrition may improve periodontal health. Why might diet help? Plant-based diets have a number of nutritional benefits in terms of nutrient density, but it also may be about improving balance between free radicals and our antioxidant defense system. Traditionally, dietary advice for oral health was just about avoiding sugar, which feed the bad bacteria on our teeth. We now realize that some foods and beverages, like green tea, possess antimicrobial properties to combat the plaque producing bacteria directly. If plaque is caused by bacteria, why not use antibiotics? Many such attempts have been made, however undesirable side-effects such as “antibiotic resistance, vomiting, diarrhea and teeth stains have precluded their use.” In a petri dish, green tea phytonutrients effectively inhibit the growth of these bacteria, but what about in our mouths? Researchers found that rinsing with green tea strongly inhibited the growth of the plaque bacteria on our teeth within minutes. Seven minutes after swishing with green tea, the number of harmful bacteria in the plaque scraped from people’s teeth was cut nearly in half. If you swish sugar water in your mouth, within three minutes the pH on our teeth can drop into the cavity formation danger zone. But if 20 minutes before swishing with sugar water, you swished with some green tea, you wipe out so many plaque bacteria that the same sugar water hardly has any effect at all. The researchers conclude that using green tea as a mouthwash or adding it to toothpaste could be a cost effective cavity prevention measure, especially in developing countries. In the “civilized world,” we have antiseptic mouthwashes with fancy chemicals like chlorhexidine, considered the gold standard anti-plaque agent. If only it didn’t cause genetic damage. DNA damage has been detected in individuals who rinsed their mouths with chlorhexidine-containing mouthwashes, and not just to cells in the mouth. 13 volunteers rinsed their mouths with the stuff for a few weeks, and there was an increase in DNA damage both in the cells lining their cheeks as well as in their peripheral blood cells, suggesting that chlorhexidine was absorbed into their bodies. It reduced plaque better than other antiseptic chemicals, but it’s doubtful whether chlorhexidine can still be considered the golden standard considering how toxic it is to human cells. Are we left with having to decide between effectiveness and safety? How about a head to head test between chlorhexidine and green tea? Researchers found that green tea worked better than chlorhexidine at reducing plaque. Using green tea as a mouthwash may be cheaper, safer, and better. If, as a bonus, you want to sprinkle some amla powder (dried Indian gooseberry powder) into it, you may make it an even better plaque buster. Amla evidently shows an outstanding cavity-stopping potential not by killing off the bacteria like green tea, but by actually suppressing the bacteria’s plaque forming abilities. I now keep a mason jar filled with cold-steeped green tea (Cold Steeping Green Tea) with a spoonful of amla in the fridge and swish and swallow a few times a day. For extra credit you can gargle a bit with it too (see my video Can Gargling Prevent the Common Cold?). Green tea shouldn’t be the primary beverage of children, though, as the natural fluoride content may cause cosmetic spots on the teeth. For more check out my video Childhood Tea Drinking May Increase Fluorosis Risk. Another reason we may want to avoid antibacterial mouthwashes is that they can kill off the good bacteria on our tongue that are instrumental in enhancing athletic performance with nitrate-containing vegetables (See Don’t Use Antiseptic Mouthwash). For more on this, check out my video from yesterday, Antibacterial Toothpaste: Harmful, Helpful, or Harmless? Need a reminder what amla is?

A-115	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/19/bile-binding-beets/	Bile Binding Beets	In my video Breast Cancer and Constipation, I discussed how fruits and veggies bind carcinogenic bile acids in our gut. Since bile acids are absorbed back into our systems, they may increase our risk of not only colon cancer but also other cancers as well. In light of this, researchers publishing in the journal, Nutrition Research, concluded that to “lower the risk of diet and lifestyle-related premature degenerative diseases and to advance human nutrition research, relative bile acid–binding potential of foods and fractions need to be evaluated.” They found that some vegetables bind bile acids better than others. We know that those eating more plant-based diets are at a lower risk of heart disease and cancer. This could partly be because of phytonutrients in plants that act as antioxidants and potent stimulators of natural detoxifying enzymes in our bodies. Veggies can also lower cholesterol and detoxify harmful metabolites, functions that can be predicted by their ability to bind bile acids. A group of USDA researchers studying this topic discovered three important things. First, they found an over five-fold variability in bile acid binding among various vegetables that had similar fiber content, suggesting that bile acid binding is not just related to total dietary fiber content (as previously thought), but instead some combination of unique phytonutrients yet to be determined. Second, they discovered that steaming significantly improves the bile acid binding of collards, kale, mustard greens, broccoli, peppers, cabbage, beets, eggplant, asparagus, carrots, green beans, and cauliflower, suggesting that in this way steaming vegetables may be more healthful than those consumed raw. Finally, they ranked multiple vegetables for bile binding ability. Which vegetables kicked the most bile butt? (in my video, Which Vegetable Binds Bile Best?, you can see a visual comparison of bile binding ability.) Turnips turned up last. Then came cabbage, cauliflower, bell peppers, spinach, asparagus and green beans. Mustard greens and broccoli were better. Eggplant, carrots and Brussels sprouts basically tie for the #5 slot. Then collards at #4. Kale got the bronze, okra the silver, and beets the gold. Kale, surprisingly, got beet. The researchers concluded that inclusion of all these vegetables in our daily diets should be encouraged. When consumed regularly, they concluded, these vegetables may lower the risk of premature degenerative diseases and improve public health. More raw versus cooked comparisons in Beets also have a number of other remarkable properties.

A-116	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/14/bile-acids-and-breast-cancer/	Bile Acids & Breast Cancer	Why do constipated women appear to be at higher risk for breast cancer? The results of a 1989 study out of the American Journal of Public Health suggested a slight increased risk of breast cancer for both decreased frequency of bowel movements and firm stool consistency. Women who had three or more bowel movements a day appeared to cut their risk of breast cancer in half. This could be because constipation means a greater contact time between our waste and our intestinal wall, which may increase the formation and absorption of fecal mutagens—substances that cause DNA mutations and cancer—into our circulation, eventually ending up in breast tissue. The concept that more frequent bowl movements decrease breast cancer risk dates back more than a century, where severe constipation, so-called “chronic intestinal stasis,” was sometimes dealt with surgically. Figuring that the colon was an inessential part of the human anatomy, why not cure constipation by just cutting it out? After the surgery, they noticed that potentially precancerous changes in the breasts of constipated women seemed to disappear. It would take another 70 years before researchers followed up on the clues by those distinguished surgeons who claimed breast pathology cleared when constipation was corrected. A 1981 study published in The Lancet investigated the relation between potentially precancerous changes in the breast and the frequency of bowl movements in nearly 1,500 women (See Breast Cancer and Constipation). The researchers found that the risk of precancerous changes was four times greater in women reporting two or fewer bowel movements a week compared to more than once daily. We know that even the non-lactating breast actively takes up chemical substances from the blood. We also know that there are mutagens in feces. It is not unreasonable to suggest that potentially toxic substances derived from the colon have damaging or even carcinogenic effects upon the lining of the breast. Toxic substances like bile acids. Bile acids were first shown to promote tumors in mice in 1940, but subsequent experiments on rats led to the mistaken belief that bile acids just promoted existing cancers and couldn’t initiate tumors themselves. However, there is a fundamental difference between the rodent models and human cancer. Rats only live a few years, while humans can live dozens; so, the opportunity for cancer causing mutations may be at least 30 times greater in humans. We now have at least 15 studies that show that bile acids can damage DNA, strongly suggesting they can initiate new cancers as well. Bile acids are formed as a way of getting rid of excess cholesterol. Our liver dumps bile acids into the intestine for disposal, assuming our intestines will be packed with fiber to trap it and flush it out of the body. But if we haven’t been eating enough fiber-rich whole plant foods, bile acids can be reabsorbed back into the body and build up in the breast. Carcinogenic bile acids are found concentrated in the fluid of breast cysts at up to a hundred times the level found in the bloodstream. By radioactively tagging bile acids, researchers were able to show that intestinal bile acids rapidly gain access to the breast, where they can exert an estrogen-like cancer-promoting effect on breast tumor cells. This would explain why we see 50% higher bile acid levels in the bloodstream of newly diagnosed breast cancer victims. These findings support the concept of a relationship between intestinally-derived bile acids and risk of breast cancer. So, how can we facilitate the removal of bile acids from our body? Slowed colonic transit can increase bile acid levels. Therefore, to decrease absorption of bile acids, we can speed up the so-called “oro-anal transit time,” the speed at which food goes from mouth to toilet, by eating lots of fiber. A diet packed with plants greatly increases bile acid excretion. Fiber can bind up and remove other toxic elements like lead and mercury as well as cholesterol and bile acids. But plants can bind bile acids even independent of fiber. Vegan diets bind significantly more bile acid than lacto-ovo or non-vegetarian diets even at the same fiber intake, which could explain why individuals eating vegetarian might excrete less mutagenic feces in the first place. I touched on this in my live presentation From Table to Able: Combating Disabling Diseases with Food, but what I didn’t get to discuss is the relative bile acid binding abilities of different foods. I cover that in my video Which Vegetable Binds Bile Best? What intestinal transit time should we be shooting for? See Food Mass Transit. That may be why Stool Size Matters. Also, How Many Bowel Movements Should You Have Every Day? We can improve speed and size by Bulking Up on Antioxidants and eating lots of whole plant foods (Prunes vs. Metamucil vs. Vegan Diet). Fiber may also help women remove excess estrogen from their body. See my video Fiber vs. Breast Cancer. For more on the wonders of fiber, see Dr. Burkitt’s F-Word Diet.

A-117	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/12/evidence-based-nutrition/	Evidence-Based Nutrition	Dr. Esselstyn’s landmark study, demonstrating that even advanced triple vessel coronary artery disease could be reversed with a plant-based diet, has been criticized for being such a small study. But the reason we’re used to seeing large studies is that they typically show such small effects. Drug manufacturers may need to study 7,000 people in order to show a barely statistically significant 15% drop in ischemic events in a subsample of patients. Esselstyn achieved a 100% drop in those who stuck to his diet, all the more compelling considering that those 18 participants had experienced 49 coronary events (like heart attacks) in the eight years before they went on the diet. These patients were the sickest of the sick, most of whom having already failed surgical intervention. When the effects are so dramatic, how many people do you need? Before 1885, a symptomatic rabies infection was a death sentence, until little Joseph Meister became the first to receive Pasteur’s experimental rabies vaccine. The results of this and one other case were so dramatic compared with previous experience that the new treatment was accepted with a sample size of two. That is, the results were so compelling that no randomized controlled trial was necessary. Having been infected by a rabid dog, would you be willing to participate in a randomized controlled trial, when being in the control group had a certainty of a ‘‘most awful death’’? Sadly, such a question is not entirely rhetorical. In the 1970’s, a revolutionary treatment for babies with immature lungs called “extracorporeal membranous oxygenation” (ECMO), transformed immature lung mortality from 80% dead to 80% alive nearly overnight. The standard therapy caused damage to infants’ lungs and was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. ECMO is much gentler on babies’ lungs, “providing life support while allowing the lungs to ‘rest.’” Despite their dramatic success, the researchers who developed ECMO felt forced to perform a randomized controlled trial. They didn’t want to; they knew they’d be condemning babies to death. They felt compelled to perform such a trial because their claim that ECMO worked would, they judged, carry little weight amongst their medical colleagues unless supported by a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, at Harvard’s Children’s Hospital, 39 infants were randomized to either get ECMO or conventional medical therapy. The researchers decided ahead of time to stop the trial after the 4th death so as not to kill too many babies. And that’s what they did. The study was halted after the fourth conventional medical therapy death, at which point nine out of nine ECMO babies had survived. Imagine being the parent to one of those four children. Similarly, imagine being the child of a parent who died from conventional medical or surgical therapy for heart disease. In her paper “How evidence-based medicine biases physicians against nutrition,” Laurie Endicott Thomas reminds us that medical students in the United States are taught very little about nutrition (See Evidence-Based Medicine or Evidence-Biased?). Worse yet, according to Thomas, their training actually biases them against the studies that show the power of dietary approaches to managing disease by encouraging them to ignore any information that does not come from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Yet, humans cannot be blinded to a dietary intervention—we tend to notice what we’re eating—and, as a result, physicians are biased in favor of drug treatments and against dietary interventions for the management of chronic disease. Evidence-based medicine is a good thing. However, Thomas points out that the medical profession may be focusing too much on one type of evidence to the exclusion of all others. Unfortunately, this approach can easily degenerate into “ignoring-most-of-the-truly-important-evidence” based medicine. Heart disease is a perfect example. On healthy enough plant based diets, our number one cause of death may simply cease to exist. The Cornell-Oxford-China Study showed that even small amounts of animal-based food were associated with a small, but measurable increase in the risk of some chronic diseases. In other words, “the causal relationship between dietary patterns and coronary artery disease was already well established before Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn undertook their clinical studies.” The value of their studies was not so much in providing evidence that such a dietary change would be effective, but in showing that “physicians can persuade their patients to make such changes,” and in “providing interesting data on the speed and magnitude of the change in severe atherosclerotic lesions as a result of dietary therapy.” Therefore, any complaints that these studies were small or unblinded are simply irrelevant. Because the evidence of the role of diet in causing atherosclerosis is already so overwhelming, “assigning a patient to a control group eating the standard American diet could be considered a violation of research ethics.” Evidence of the value of plant-based diets for managing chronic disease has been available in the medical literature for decades. Walter Kempner at Duke University, John McDougall, the Physician’s Committee for Responsible Medicine, Nathan Pritikin, and Denis Burkitt all warned us that the standard Western diet is the standard cause of death and disability in the Western world.

A-118	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/07/the-dietary-link-between-acne-and-cancer/	The Dietary Link Between Acne & Cancer	Acne is an epidemic skin disease of industrialized countries, reaching prevalence rates of over 85 percent of teenagers. In nearly half of American men and women, acne even continues after adolescence and into the third decade of life. Acne is considered a disease of Western civilization, as in places like Okinawa, Japan, acne is rare or even nonexistent. So, acne is not some “physiological” phenomenon of puberty, but may represent “a visible risk indicator pointing to aberrant nutrient signaling promoting chronic epidemic diseases of civilization,” according to a group of German researchers (See Saving Lives By Treating Acne With Diet). What they mean is that the dairy, junk foods, meat, and egg proteins in Western diets all conspire to raise the activity of the enzyme TOR, contributing to acne and obesity. Therefore, using diet to suppress TOR may not only improve acne, but may also prevent the march to more serious chronic TOR-driven diseases of civilization. The excessive TOR stimulation induced by the standard American diet may initially manifest as premature puberty and acne, but then may later contribute to obesity, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. A lot of this research is relatively new. Until recently, for example, only a weak association had been accepted for the role of milk and other dairy products in acne formation.  However, there is now substantial evidence supporting the effects of milk and dairy products as enhancers of acne aggravation. Milk is not just food, but appears to represent a most sophisticated hormone signaling system activating TOR, which is of critical concern given that TOR is recognized as the fundamental driving force for a number of serious chronic diseases. If milk is naturally supposed to stimulate TOR, why the problem? Because we’re drinking milk from the wrong species. Cow’s milk is designed for calves. Baby cows grow nearly 40 times faster than human infants. Cow’s milk has three times more leucine, the primary activator of TOR, than breast milk; so, cow’s milk may over-stimulate TOR when consumed by humans. It’s like giving donkey milk to rats—it doesn’t make sense. Furthermore, milk is for babies; so, the continued consumption of any kind of milk during adolescence and adulthood is something that never really happened naturally and may have long-term adverse effects on human health. In this regard, it’s kind of frightening to realize that more than 85 percent of teens in Western countries exhibit acne; it implies that the “majority of our population is living with over-activated TOR signaling, a major disease-causing factor, which may pave the way for the development of other more serious diseases.” A history of acne has been associated with breast cancer risk in women, for example, and prostate cancer in men. So, early dietary counseling of teenage acne patients is thus a great opportunity for dermatologists, who will not only help to improve acne but may reduce the long-term adverse effects of Western diet on more serious TOR-driven diseases. So, just like urologists use erectile dysfunction as an opportunity to save lives by putting people on heart-healthy diets, dermatologists can use acne as a way to save lives by putting people on a cancer prevention diet. How do you turn acne on and off via dietary manipulation of TOR? A “comprehensive dietary strategy to treat acne can only be achieved by higher consumption of vegetables and fruit and reduction of animal-derived food,” given preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of natural plant-derived TOR inhibitors in the treatment of acne. TOR is considered the engine-of-aging enzyme detailed in Why Do We Age? and Caloric Restriction vs. Animal Protein Restriction, as well as my video Prevent Cancer From Going on TOR. I’ve touched on this topic before in Acne and Cancer and covered acne and dairy in: Urologists saving the lives of men is detailed in Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death and 50 Shades of Greens.

A-119	http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/01/05/how-to-suppress-the-aging-enzyme-tor/	How to Suppress the Aging Enzyme TOR	Over the last decade, more than 5,000 papers have been published about TOR, an engine-of-aging enzyme inhibited by the drug rapamycin. (What is TOR? Check out my videos Why Do We Age? and Caloric Restriction vs. Animal Protein Restriction.) Rapamycin has been used experimentally to extend lifespan, but is already in use clinically to prevent the rejection of kidney transplants. Patients who received rapamycin due to renal transplantation had a peculiar “side effect,” a decrease in cancer incidence. In a set of 15 patients who had biopsy proven Kaposi’s sarcoma (a cancer that often affects the skin), all cutaneous sarcoma lesions disappeared in all patients within three months after starting rapamycin therapy. TOR functions as a master regulator of cellular growth and proliferation. For example, TOR is upregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human prostate cancers (See Prevent Cancer From Going on TOR). So, reductions in cancerous lesions after rapamycin therapy make sense. TOR may also be why dairy consumption has been found to be a major dietary risk factor for prostate cancer. We used to think it was just the hormones in milk, but maybe prostate cancer initiation and progression is also promoted by cow’s milk stimulation of TOR. Our understanding of mammalian milk has changed from a simple food to a “species-specific endocrine signaling system,” which activates TOR, promoting cell growth and proliferation and suppressing our body’s internal housecleaning mechanisms. Normally, milk-mediated TOR stimulation is restricted only to infancy where we really need that constant signal to our cells to grow and divide. So, from an evolutionary perspective, “the persistent ‘abuse’ of the growth-promoting signaling system of cow’s milk by drinking milk over our entire life span may maintain the most important hallmark of cancer biology, sustained proliferative signaling.” TOR appears to play a role in breast cancer, too. Higher TOR expression has been noted in breast cancer tumors, associated with more aggressive disease, and lower survival rate among breast cancer patients. Altered TOR expression could explain why women hospitalized for anorexia may end up with only half the risk of breast cancer. Severe caloric restriction in humans may confer protection from invasive breast cancer by suppressing TOR activation. We don’t have to starve ourselves to suppress TOR; just reducing animal protein intake can attenuate overall TOR activity. Moreover, diets emphasizing plants, especially cruciferous vegetables, decrease TOR activation from animal proteins while providing natural plant-derived inhibitors of TOR found in broccoli, green tea, soy, turmeric, and grapes, along with other fruits and vegetables such as onions, strawberries, blueberries, mangoes and the skin of cucumbers. The downregulation of TOR may be one reason why plant-based diets in general are associated with lower risk for many cancers. “Are we finally on the threshold of being able to fundamentally alter human aging and age-related disease?” ask researchers in the journal Nature. Only time will tell, but if the pace and direction of recent progress are any indication, the next 5,000 studies on TOR should prove very interesting indeed.

A-120	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/29/starch-blocking-foods-for-diabetics/	Starch-Blocking Foods for Diabetics?	How did doctors treat diabetes before insulin? Almost a thousand medicinal plants are known antidiabetic agents, including beans, most of which have been used in traditional medicine. Of course, just because something has been used for centuries doesn’t mean it’s safe. Other treatments for diabetes in the past included arsenic and uranium. Thankfully many of these other remedies fell by the wayside, but scientific interest in the antidiabetic potential of beans was renewed in the past decade. Diabetes is a global public health epidemic. Although oral hypoglycemic medications and injected insulin are the mainstay of treatment of diabetes and are effective in controlling high blood sugars, they have side effects such as weight gain, swelling, and liver disease. They also are not shown to significantly alter the progression of the disease. Thankfully, lifestyle modifications have proven to be greatly effective in the management of this disease. And if there is one thing diabetics should eat, it’s legumes (beans, chickpeas, split peas, and lentils). Increased consumption of whole grains and legumes for health-promoting diets is widely promoted by health professionals. One of the reasons is that they may decrease insulin resistance, the defining trait of type 2 diabetes. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the Canadian Diabetes Association and the American Diabetes Association all recommend the consumption of dietary pulses as a means of optimizing diabetes control. What are pulses? They’re peas and beans that come dried, and are therefore a subset of legumes. They exclude green beans and fresh green peas, which are considered more vegetable crops, and the so-called oil seeds—soybeans and peanuts. A review out of Canada (highlighted in my video, Diabetes Should Take Their Pulses) compiled 41 randomized controlled experimental trials, totaling more than a thousand patients, and corroborated the diabetes association nutrition guidelines recommending the consumption of pulses as a means of optimizing diabetes control. They discovered that some pulses are better than others. Some of the best results came from the studies that used chickpeas. In terms of beans, pintos and black beans may beat out kidney beans. Compared to the blood sugar spike of straight white rice, the combination of black or pinto beans with rice appeared to reduce the spike more than kidney beans and rice. Dark red kidney beans may not be as effective because they have lower levels of indigestible starch. One of the reasons beans are so healthy is they contain compounds that partially block our starch-digesting enzyme, which allows some starch to make it down to our colon to feed our good gut bacteria. In fact, the inhibition of this starch-eating enzyme amylase, just by eating beans, approximates that of a carbohydrate-blocking drug called acarbose (sold as Precose), a popular diabetes medication. The long-term use of beans may normalize hemoglobin A1C levels (which is how you track diabetes) almost as well as the drug. What about avoiding metabolic derangements in the first place? See my video Preventing Prediabetes By Eating More. What else may help?

A-121	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/24/which-works-better-adding-beans-or-portion-control/	Which Works Better: Adding Beans or Portion Control?	 Bean consumption is associated with lower body weight, a slimmer waist, less obesity and lower blood pressure in population studies, but whether the association of bean consumption with healthier body weight and risk factors of metabolic syndrome is due to physiological effects of the beans themselves or is simply an indicator of a healthy lifestyle is uncertain. Anyone smart enough to eat beans may be smart enough to eat all sorts of other healthy foods, so maybe bean consumption is just a marker for a healthy diet. A study out of the British Journal of Nutrition put this to the test (highlighted in my video, Preventing Prediabetes by Eating More). The researchers note that reducing belly fat may be the best way to treat metabolic syndrome and reduce the risk of prediabetes turning into full-blown diabetes. “Energy restriction has been the cornerstone of most weight-loss strategies; however, evidence suggests that the majority of individuals who lose weight [by calorie-cutting] regain it during subsequent months or years.” Starving ourselves almost never works long-term. Therefore, they conclude that “it is important to identify foods that can be easily incorporated into the diet and spontaneously lead to the attainment and maintenance of a healthy body weight and improved metabolic control.” So, for the first time ever, the researchers did a head-to-head test: beans versus caloric restriction. The bean group was asked to eat five cups of lentils, chickpeas, split peas, or navy beans a week, and the caloric restriction group was asked to reduce energy intake. In other words, the bean group was asked to eat more food and the cutting calories group was asked to eat less food. Not-so-surprisingly, the more-food group won. Not only was regular bean consumption as effective as portion control in reducing prediabetes risk factors like slimming waistlines and better blood sugar control, but the bean diet led to additional benefits beyond just calorie reduction, presumably due to some functional properties of the beans and peas. The researchers concluded that five cups a week of beans, chickpeas, split peas and lentils in an ad libitum diet (meaning subjects weren’t told to change their diet in any other way), reduced risk factors of metabolic syndrome. These effects were equivalent, and in some instances stronger, than telling people to cut 500 calories from their daily diet. These results are encouraging news for individuals with or at risk for type 2 diabetes since they indicate that simple diet changes, such as the inclusion of beans, can have a positive impact on blood sugar control.

A-122	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/22/which-nut-suppresses-cancer-cell-growth-the-most/	Which Nut Suppresses Cancer Cell Growth the Most?	People who eat nuts in their adolescence may have a better chance of fighting off breast cancer later in life, according to data from the Harvard Nurse’s Study. A follow-up study involving the daughters of the nurses corroborated the findings. Those eating more peanut butter, nuts, beans, lentils, soybeans, or corn were found to have just a fraction of the risk for fibrocystic breast disease, which places one at higher risk of cancer. The protective effects were found to be strongest for those most at risk, such as those with a family history of breast cancer. Another study out of the British Journal of Cancer found that even two handfuls of nuts a week may protect against pancreatic cancer, one of our most fatal malignancies. Nuts are described as “nutritionally precious,” which may explain some of the mechanisms by which nut components induce cancer cell death and inhibit cancer growth and spread in vitro. But which nuts work the best? In my video #1 Anticancer Vegetable, we learned that two classes of vegetables—the broccoli family vegetables and the garlic family vegetables—most effectively suppressed breast cancer cell growth. In Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better?, cranberries and lemons took the title. What about nuts? In terms of antioxidant content, walnuts and pecans steal the show. Twenty-five walnuts have the antioxidant equivalent of eight grams of vitamin C (the vitamin C found in a hundred oranges). But how do they do against cancer? In the video, Which Nut Fights Cancer Better?, you can see a graph of human cancer cell proliferation versus increasing concentrations of the ten most common nuts eaten in the United States. If you drip water on these cancer cells as a control, nothing happens. Hazelnuts, pistachios and Brazil nuts don’t do much better. Pine nuts, cashews and macadamias start pulling away from the pack. Almonds appear twice as protective, halving cancer cell growth at only half the dose as pine nuts, cashews, and macadamias. Walnuts, pecans, and peanuts come out as the clear winners, causing a dramatic drop in cancer proliferation at just tiny doses.

Financially, 2015 was a great year for NutritionFacts.org thanks to the book advance for How Not to Die. But without new book income in 2016, we are back to relying on our steadfast supporters. The average donation we get is less than $30, but we reach so many millions that even if 1 in 1,000 people pitch in a few bucks we are able to thrive. Please consider doing your part and make a one-time end-of-year donation (we’re a 501c3 nonprofit so donations are tax-deductible). Or even better, become a monthly supporter. 59% of our operating budget now comes from regular supporters who sign up to make small recurring donations every month—they build up!  Where do donations to NutritionFacts.org go? I don’t take a salary or receive any compensation (other than all the warm fuzzies from helping everyone :), but we do have a growing staff. As you can see in the pie chart, the greatest cost is our research budget. This includes access fees for journal articles and our burgeoning research team. My goal is to not let a single nutrition study fall through the cracks. There are 30 to 40 papers published on straight nutrition alone every day, in addition to 100 daily studies on cancer, about 20 on heart disease, 20 on obesity, and 20 on diabetes, etc. Even I can’t read 200 papers a day. Twenty people, though, can read 200 papers a day. We can’t afford 20 people, but total coverage is my ultimate goal; otherwise we fall hopelessly behind. For example, I have an email folder of PubMed alerts on the critical nutrition topics that I follow. (The National Library of Medicine will send you free email alerts any time a study is published on any topic of your choosing—one of the uses of my tax dollars for which I’m most grateful!) In part, because of the 8 months I had to set aside to write the book, I now have 5,000 of these emails sitting in my inbox. That’s when it really struck me. Since each alert can contain up to 200 research summaries, that could be a million citations to go through, with new ones arriving every day. That’s when I realized I needed more help. Sadly, in order to hire more researchers I’ve had to cut the RD position. So, this will be Joe’s last month. In his all-too-brief tenure with us this year, Joseph Gonzales, RD, answered more than 2,000 questions on the site and responded to innumerable emails. Please join me in wishing Joe a heartfelt thanks for all his hard work. I’m hoping our volunteer army of medical and nutritional professionals will step up to help take up the slack to respond to the multitude of comments and questions posted daily. Even with this freeing up of funds, hiring additional researchers still puts us $80,000 over our projected 2016 budget. We’ve already raised about $16,000 towards that year-end goal.

A-124	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/15/making-plant-based-diets-the-new-normal/	Making Plant-Based Diets the New Normal	A Nutritional Update for Physicians was published in the official journal of Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed care organization in the United States. It told physicians that healthy eating may best be achieved with a plant-based diet, defined as a regimen that “encourages whole, plant-based foods and discourages meats, dairy and eggs as well as all refined and processed junk.” The Update notes: “too often, physicians ignore the potential benefits of good nutrition and quickly prescribe medications instead of giving patients a chance to correct their disease through healthy eating and active living. Physicians should therefore consider recommending a plant-based diet to all their patients, especially those with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or obesity.” The major downside described is that it may work a little too well. If people are on medications, their blood pressure or blood sugar could actually drop too low, so physicians may need to adjust medications or eliminate them altogether. The report continues that “despite the strong body of evidence favoring plant-based diets, many physicians are not stressing the importance of plant-based diets as a first-line treatment for chronic illnesses. This could be because of a lack of physician awareness or a lack of patient education resources.” So Kaiser sought to change that. “Want to lose weight, feel better, improve, stabilize, or even reverse chronic disease, and get off some of your medications?” a Kaiser Permanente leaflet (which you can see in my video, What Diet Should Physicians Recommend?) asks. “If you answered ‘yes’ to any of these questions, then a plant-based eating plan may be for you.” Side-effects include: lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar; reversal or prevention of heart disease, our number one killer; a longer life; a healthier weight; lower risk of diabetes; improvement of inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis; and a slowed progression of certain types of cancer. Kaiser offers tips to get started, such as meal plan ideas, and a list of online resources (including NutritionFacts.org!). The paper ends with a familiar refrain: “further research is needed.” In this case, though, further research is necessary, they explained,  to “find ways to make plant-based diets the new normal for our patients and employees.” So exciting to see lifestyle medicine suppported.

A-125	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/10/coffee-for-hepatitis-c/	Coffee for Hepatitis C	Decades ago, researchers in Norway came upon an unexpected finding. Alcohol consumption was associated with liver inflammation (no surprise), but a protective association was found for coffee consumption. These findings were replicated in the U.S. and around the world. Those at risk for liver disease—who drank a lot of alcohol or were overweight—appeared to cut their risk in half if they drank more than two cups of coffee a day. Liver cancer is one of the most feared complications of liver inflammation. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer death, and the incidence has been rapidly rising in the United States and Europe, largely driven by the burden of hepatitis C infection and fatty liver disease. Putting together all the best studies done to date, those drinking the most coffee had half the risk of liver cancer compared to those that drank the least. Since the meta-analysis was published, a new study found that male smokers may be able to cut their risk of liver cancer more than 90% by drinking four or more cups of coffee a day. (Of course, they could also stop smoking!). It’s similar to heavy drinkers of alcohol: drinking more coffee may decrease liver inflammation, but not as much as drinking less alcohol. Liver cancers are among the most avoidable cancers, through hepatitis B vaccination, control of hepatitis C transmission, and reduction of alcohol drinking. These three measures could, in principle, wipe out 90% of liver cancers worldwide. It remains unclear whether coffee drinking has an additional role on top of that, but in any case such a role would be limited compared to preventing liver damage in the first place. But what if you already have hepatitis C or are among the 30% of Americans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease due to obesity, which may quadruple one’s risk of dying from liver cancer? Coffee seems to help with hepatitis C, reducing liver damage, disease activity, and mortality. It was only the lack of randomized, interventional studies on the topic that prevented us from concluding that coffee has a protective effect. But in 2013 we got such a study, a randomized controlled trial on the effects of coffee consumption in chronic hepatitis C (highlighted in my video, Preventing Liver Cancer with Coffee). Forty patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomized into two groups: the first consumed four cups of coffee/day for 30 days, while the second remained coffee “abstinent.” Then the groups switched for the second month. Two months is too soon to detect changes in cancer rates, but the researchers were able to demonstrate that coffee consumption reduces oxidative DNA damage, increases the death of virus infected cells, stabilizes chromosomes, and reduces fibrosis, all of which could explain the role coffee appears to play in reducing the risk of disease progression and of evolution to cancer. Is it time to write a prescription for coffee for those at risk for liver disease? Some say no: “[A]lthough the results are promising, additional work is needed to identify which specific component of coffee is the contributing factor in reducing liver disease and related mortality.” There are, after all, more than 1000 compounds that could be responsible for its beneficial effects. But that’s such a pharmacological worldview. Why do we have to know exactly what it is in the coffee bean before we can start using them to help people? Yes, more studies are needed, but in the interim, moderate, daily, unsweetened coffee ingestion is a reasonable adjunct to therapy for people at high risk such as those with fatty liver disease. Daily consumption of caffeinated beverages can lead to physical dependence. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms can include days of headache, fatigue, difficulty with concentration, and mood disturbances. But this dependence could be a good thing: “The tendency for coffee to promote habitual consumption may ultimately be advantageous if its myriad potential health benefits are confirmed.” More on coffee in: Broccoli can boost the liver’s detoxifying enzymes (Prolonged Liver Function Enhancement from Broccoli) but one can overdo it (Liver Toxicity Due to Broccoli Juice?).

That’s not what the website was made for. It’s NutritionFacts, not nutrition opinions! Interviewers are always asking me “What do you eat, Dr. Greger?” and I have to say, “It doesn’t matter what I eat; all that matters is what the science shows.” OK, but how do I take all this amazing science I’ve learned and transform it into what I actually feed my family? How do I make it digestible? (Literally!) Well, I’ve just never had an outlet to share all those personal judgements before… until now.  That’s Part 2 of the book, in which I introduce my Daily Dozen checklist of all the things we should try to fit into an optimal diet. The book details both my life and my life’s work, all rolled into one. Find it in your local bookstore or online at:  If you’d like to ask me a question in person, most of my December speaking events are sold out, but there is still space available in Baltimore, Tucson, and Detroit.

A-128	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/01/do-dietary-toxins-contribute-to-hand-tremors/	Do Dietary Toxins Contribute to Hand Tremors?	Essential tremor, affecting 1 in 25 adults over 40 and up to 1 in 5 of those in their 90s, is one of the most common neurological diseases. In addition to the potentially debilitating hand tremor, there can be other neuropsychiatric manifestations, including difficulty walking and various levels of cognitive impairment. Might beta-carboline neurotoxins play a role in essential tremor? Harmane is one of the most potent of the tremor-producing neurotoxins. Expose people to harmane, and they develop tremors; take it away, and the tremors disappear. What if we’re exposed long-term? A recent study at Columbia University, highlighted in my video, Essential Tremor and Diet, found that those with essential tremor have much higher levels of this toxin in their bloodstream compared to those without tremor. Furthermore, the higher the harmane levels, the worse the tremor. The highest levels are found in those who have both essential tremor and cancer, suggesting harmane may be playing a role in both diseases. How did folks get exposed to these chemicals? Primarily through meat: beef, pork, fish, and especially chicken. So, if this potent, tremor-producing neurotoxin is concentrated in cooked muscle foods, is meat consumption associated with a higher risk of essential tremor? Another Columbia University study found that men who ate the most meat had 21 times the odds of essential tremor. To put that in context, if we go back to the original studies on smoking and lung cancer, we see that smoking was only linked to about 14 times the odds, not 21. Blood levels of this neurotoxin may shoot up within five minutes of eating meat. Five minutes? It’s not even digested by then. This rapid uptake is indicative of significant absorption directly through the mouth straight into the bloodstream, bypassing the stomach and, most importantly, bypassing the detoxifying enzymes of the liver. This may lead to higher exposure levels in peripheral organs, like the brain. Due to its high fat solubility, harmane accumulates in brain tissue, and, using a fancy brain scan called “proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging,” higher harmane levels have been linked to greater metabolic dysfunction in the brains of essential tremor sufferers. Harmane is also found in certain heated plants, like tobacco. A broiled chicken breast has about 13 micrograms of harmane, and cigarettes average about one microgram, so a half pack of cigarettes could expose us to almost as much of this neurotoxin as a serving of chicken. Harman is created when tobacco is burned, and also when coffee beans are roasted. However, coffee intake has not been tied to increased risk (and neither has tobacco for that matter), so it may be something else in meat that’s to blame for the 2,000 percent increase in odds for this disabling brain disease. I also have a few videos about the other major tremor condition, Parkinson’s Disease: Preventing Parkinson’s Disease with Diet and Treating Parkinson’s Disease with Diet Other compounds created in cooked meats may also have implications for cancer risk: 	-	addiction,beef,beta-carboline alkaloids,brain disease,brain health,cancer,chicken,coffee,cognition,detoxification,essential tremor,fish,frying,Harmane,heterocyclic amines,liver,liver disease,liver health,lung cancer,meat,MPTP,neurotoxins,paralysis,Parkinson’s disease,pork,poultry,reindeer meat,salmon,smoking,tobacco,tremors,turkey	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20175185,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3412610/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17049563,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17497412,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764332,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/essential-tremor-and-diet/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821442/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10503893,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18709680,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17679670,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15036003,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21145352	
A-129	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/26/how-learning-to-cook-can-save-your-life/	How Learning to Cook Can Save Your Life	The eating habits of modern Americans have been described as, “eating breakfast in their cars, lunch at their desks and chicken from a bucket.” Within the last few decades, Americans are eating out more and more, and cooking fewer meals at home, which are typically healthier. Home-cooked meals tend to contain less saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, and more fiber. Therefore, the benefits to preparing healthy food at home may include the prevention of chronic disease. Just because food is prepared at home doesn’t mean it’s healthy, though. Microwaving a frozen pizza isn’t exactly home cooking. One of the problems is many people no longer know how to cook. For example, one study reported that 25% of the men in the study had absolutely no cooking skills whatsoever. Another study in the UK compared the nutritional content of meals created by television chefs to TV dinners, and both were then compared to the nutritional guidelines published by the World Health Organization. The researchers looked at a hundred of each, and not a single one complied with the nutrition standards. And the TV chef recipes were even less healthy than the TV dinners! Many people don’t know how to make healthy food taste good. This is not a new problem; an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association bemoaned the same issue back in 1913. The editorial noted that, in the United States, “vegetables are frequently boiled in a way which deprives them of their characteristic odor and their toothsomeness. ‘Villainous and idiotic’ are the only adjectives that can describe our methods of cooking vegetables.” Researchers in Taiwan recently found that in a group of elderly Taiwanese people, those who cooked their own food were not only healthier, but also lived longer. In a ten year study, highlighted in my video, Cooking to Live Longer, those who cooked most frequently had only 59% of the mortality risk. This took into account the exercise people got grocery shopping, physical function, and chewing ability. So why did they live longer? Those that cooked typically ate a more nutritious diet with a higher consumption of vegetables. The effect on mortality was much more evident in women than in men. It turns out that “men were, with doubtful justification, more positive about the nutritional value of convenience foods compared with women.” Women who cooked made better food choices in general. As one author noted in the book Something from the Oven, over the last century: “we began the long process of turning over to the food industry many of the decisions about what we eat…Today our staggering rates of obesity and diabetes are testimony to the faith we put in corporations to feed us well. But the food industry is a business, not a parent; it doesn’t care what we eat as long as we’re willing to pay for it. Home cooking these days has far more than sentimental value; it’s a survival skill.” With the onslaught of health information out there, access to simple, healthy recipes has never been easier. While cooking at home requires more effort, energy, and cleaning, the results, health aside, are often more rewarding. Learning to cook is a simple art, and with the right amount of patience and delicious ingredients, it can help us take back control of our own lives. Check out your local public library for cookbooks—I’ve been amazed at the selection in all of the cities I’ve lived. Or for those for whom books are just so 20th century, the online Rouxbe Cooking School holds healthy cooking classes.

A-130	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/24/is-it-better-to-bake-boil-or-steam-sweet-potatoes/	Is it Better to Bake, Boil, or Steam Sweet Potatoes?	I previously talked about the cancer fighting properties of sweet potatoes (See Anti-Cancer Potential of Sweet Potato Proteins) and what would happen if you centered your diet around them (The Okinawa Diet: Living to 100). It seems that the only potential downside to eating too many sweet potatoes is that you could get yellow palms (or nose as you can see in the video, The Best Way to Cook Sweet Potatoes), a harmless condition called “carotenemia.” Caused by elevated levels of beta carotene in the blood, it was first noticed a century ago when carrots were introduced into infant diets. It’s treated mostly by just reassuring parents that it’s harmless, but if we don’t want our child’s nose to be yellow, we can decrease their beta carotene intake and in a few months it will be gone. When picking out varieties at the supermarket, the intensity of the yellow or orange flesh color of the sweet potato is directly correlated to its nutritional content, so the more intense the better. Though if you really want intensity, sweet potato varieties don’t just range from white to yellow and orange, but from pink to deep purple. The natural pigments that cause these colors may have special anticancer effects. What is the best way to cook sweet potatoes? Boiling may actually retain most of the antioxidant power of sweet potatoes, compared to roasting and steaming. If we compare baking to boiling microscopically, boiling helps thin out the cell walls and gelatinize the starch, which may enhance the bioavailability of nutrients. At the same time, the glycemic index of boiled sweet potatoes was found to be about half that of baking or roasting, so boiled sweet potatoes give us less of a blood sugar spike. Make sure to keep the skin on, though. The peel of a sweet potato has nearly ten times the antioxidant power as the flesh (an antioxidant capacity comparable to that of blueberries). However, the peel’s nutrition really takes a hit when baked, which wipes out over two thirds of the antioxidants, whereas microwaving or boiling are comparatively much gentler. The same is true for the rest of the sweet potato. Baking can also cause an 80% drop in vitamin A levels, twice as much as boiling. Therefore, from a nutritional standpoint, boiling rather than baking should be recommended for cooking sweet potato. Boiling may theoretically be best, but sweet potatoes are so incredibly healthy that the actual best way to prepare them is whichever way will get you to eat the most of them! The exception is deep frying, which can lead to the formation of acrylamide, a potential human carcinogen. What about cooking methods for other vegetables? See my video Best Cooking Method.

A-131	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/19/sweet-potato-proteins-vs-cancer/	Sweet Potato Proteins vs. Cancer	Sweet potatoes can be considered a superfood. They are one of the healthiest and cheapest vegetables on the planet. (And one day, perhaps, even off the planet, as NASA has chosen the sweet potato for space missions.) A study out of the University of Washington aimed to identify which vegetables provided the most nutrients per dollar. In my video, Anti-Cancer Potential of Sweet Potato Proteins, you can see a graph of affordability versus nutrition for different foods. The healthiest foods, like dark green leafy vegetables, may also be the cheapest, and the highest nutrient-rich food scores per dollar were obtained for sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes are not just packed with nutrition but may also have special cancer-fighting properties. In 1931, a unique protein was discovered in sweet potatoes. It turns out that 80% of the protein in sweet potatoes is a type of protease inhibitor with potential anticancer effects. These proteins were originally tested against leukemia and appeared to suppress the growth of leukemia cells in a petri dish. But how would a sweet potato protein ever get into our bloodstream? As soon as most proteins hit our stomach, they start getting digested. To get around the digestion issue, researchers tried sweet potato protein against tongue cancer cells (sweet potato proteins certainly come in contact with our mouth!). Tongue cancer is often treated with chemotherapy, and most of the chemo drugs for tongue cancer have adverse effects; so, it is indispensable for us to find other therapeutic strategies. Sweet potato protein rapidly diminished viability of the cancer in vitro within a matter of days, leading the researchers to propose that sweet potatoes may be useful for human tongue cancer. But could they possibly help with other cancers as well? Remarkably, this special class of proteins doesn’t just survive digestion, but may also be absorbed into the bloodstream intact (in at least two of the nine women with advanced cervical cancer researchers tried giving them to). Most recently, sweet potato proteins were tried on colorectal cancer cells, one of our most common and deadly cancers. Normally, we just surgically remove the colon, but that only works in the early stages since there are often “micrometastases” outside the colon that can subsequently lead to cancer recurrence and death; so, we’ve been searching for anti-metastatic agents. Not only does sweet potato protein slow down the growth of colon cancer cells, but it may also decrease cancer cell migration and invasion. Sweet potato consumption has also been associated with lower gallbladder cancer rates, but it has never been directly put to the test, but what’s the downside? Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite snacks. During the harsh Boston winters during my medical training, I used to put two freshly microwaved sweet potatoes in my coat pockets as natural hand-warmers. When they cooled down, my hand-warmers became instant healthy snacks! More videos on getting the most nutrition for one’s dollar: What other vegetables might contain cancer fighting properties?

A-133	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/12/where-are-the-lowest-rates-of-alzheimers-in-the-world/	Where are the Lowest Rates of Alzheimer’s in the World?	The rates of dementia differ greatly around the world, from the lowest rates in Africa, India, and South Asia, to the highest rates in Western Europe and especially North America. Is it all just genetics? Well, the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease is significantly lower for Africans in Nigeria than for African Americans in Indianapolis, for example—up to five times lower. Alzheimer’s rates of Japanese-Americans living in the U.S. are closer to that of Americans than to Japanese. When people move from their homeland to the United States, Alzheimer’s rates can increase dramatically. Therefore, when Africans or Asians live in the United States and adopt a Western diet, their increase in Alzheimer’s risk suggests that it’s not genetics. Unfortunately, one doesn’t have to move to the West to adopt a Western diet. The prevalence of dementia in Japan has shot up over the last few decades. Mechanisms to explain this in Japan include increases in cholesterol, saturated fat, and iron from increases in the consumption of animal products. Traditional diets are generally weighted toward vegetable products such as grains and away from animal products. But since 1960, the diet in Japan has changed from a more traditional rice-based diet to one with a preponderance of meat. From 1961 to 2008, meat and animal fat increased considerably, whereas the rice supply dropped. The dietary factor most strongly associated with the rise in Alzheimer’s disease in Japan was the increased consumption of animal fat. A similar analysis in China arrived at the same conclusion. As the authors of the Japan study (highlighted in the video, Alzheimer’s Disease: Grain Brain or Meathead?) note, on the basis of these findings, the rate of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia will “continue to rise unless dietary patterns change to those with less reliance on animal products.” This is consistent with data showing those who eat vegetarian appear two to three times less likely to become demented, and the longer one eats meat-free, the lower the associated risk of dementia. Globally, the lowest validated rates of Alzheimer’s in the world are rural India, where they eat low meat, high grain, high bean, high carb diets. It’s possible that the apparent protective association between rice and Alzheimer’s is due to the fact that the drop of rice consumption was accompanied by a rise in meat consumption, but other population studies have found that dietary grains appear strongly protective in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. In other words, perhaps, don’t pass on the grain, but “pass the grain to spare the brain.” A few previous videos on Alzheimer’s and maintaining cognitive function: More on the consequences of carbophobia here: 	-	Africa,African-American,Alzheimer’s disease,animal fat,animal products,Asia,beans,cholesterol,dementia,Europe,grains,India,iron,LDL cholesterol,low-carb diets,meat,Nigeria,plant-based diets,rice,saturated fat,Standard American Diet,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23746902,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12214119,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12214118,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11176911,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16360788,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8327020,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037034,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alzheimers-disease-grain-brain-or-meathead/,http://www.atkinsexposed.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9781520,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846407,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8805729	
A-134	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/10/coca-cola-stopped-sponsoring-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/	Coca-Cola Stopped Sponsoring the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics	 The American Dietetic Association (ADA) is the world’s largest association of nutrition professionals. They claim to be devoted to “improving the nation’s health.” They promote a series of Nutrition Fact Sheets. Who writes them? Industry sources pay $20,000 per fact sheet to the ADA and explicitly take part in writing the documents. The ADA then promotes them through its journal and on its website. Some of these fact sheets are “What’s a Mom to Do: Healthy Eating Tips for Families” sponsored by Wendy’s; “Lamb: The Essence of Nutrient Rich Flavor,” sponsored by the Tri-Lamb Group; “Cocoa and Chocolate: Sweet News” sponsored by the Hershey Center for Health and Nutrition; “Eggs: A Good Choice for Moms-to-Be” sponsored by the American Egg Board’s Egg Nutrition Center; “Adult Beverage Consumption: Making Responsible Drinking Choices” in connection with the Distilled Spirits Council; and “The Benefits of Chewing Gum” sponsored by the Wrigley Science Institute. For visuals, see Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Conflicts of Interest. Did you know there was a Wrigley Science Institute? In 2008, the ADA announced that the Coca-Cola Company had become an “ADA Partner” through its corporate relations sponsorship program. The ADA “provides partners a national platform via ADA events and programs with prominent access to key influencers, thought leaders and decision makers in the nutrition marketplace.” The ADA’s press release also pointed out that “the Coca-Cola Company will share their research findings with ADA members in forums such as professional meetings and scientific publications.” For example, did you know there are “No Harmful Effects of Different Coca-Cola Beverages on Rat Testicles?” Was that even a concern? Thou doth protest too much methinks… When the American Academy of Pediatrics was called out on their proud new corporate relationship with Coke to support patient education on healthy eating, an executive vice-president of the Academy tried to quell protest by explaining that this alliance was not without precedent. The American Academy of Pediatrics has had relationships with Pepsi and McDonald’s for some time. This is reminiscent of similar types of relationships in the past, like doctors promoting cigarette smoking. The fact that the Academy of Pediatrics was also collaborating with Pepsi and McDonald’s didn’t seem to placate the critics. So, the executive continued, noting that the American Dietetic Association has made a policy statement that “There are no good or bad foods.” Indeed, that’s the ADA’s official position, “classification of specific foods as good or bad is overly simplistic.” One commentator asks, “Is this what [family doctors] have been reduced to…? To justify an unholy financial alliance we hide behind what others say and do and deny that there are actually unhealthy, ‘bad’ foods. I wonder how much money the ADA receives from the Coca-Cola Company and other food and beverage companies to have come up with this counter-intuitive ‘no good or bad foods’ philosophy?” In 2012, the American Dietetic Association changed their name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Did their policies change at all? A landmark report from one of my favorite industry watchdogs, Michele Simon, found that they continue to take millions of dollars in corporate sponsorship money every year from meat, processed junk, dairy, soda, and candy bar companies, and in return offer official educational seminars to teach dietitians what to say to their clients. So, when you hear the title “registered dietitian,” this is the group they’re forced to be registered through. Thankfully, there are also Dietitians for Professional Integrity. For more on the corrosive effect of money and politics in nutrition, see: There are lots of evidence-based dietitians, such as Brenda Davis,  Jeff Novick, and Julieanna Hever–not to mention our very own Joseph Gonzales! 	-	Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,alcohol,American Academy of Pediatrics,American Dietetics Association,American Egg Board,animal studies,candy,chewing gum,chocolate,Coca Cola,cocoa,dairy,eggs,fast food,Hershey’s,industry influence,junk food,McDonald's,meat,Pepsi,smoking,soda,tobacco	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://plantbaseddietitian.com/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24001441,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/rdquestions/,http://www.brendadavisrd.com/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23351634,http://www.jeffnovick.com/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20063212,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470496/figure/f4/,http://www.eatdrinkpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/AND_Corporate_Sponsorship_Report.pdf,http://integritydietitians.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19298423,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.eatdrinkpolitics.com/	
A-135	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/05/how-dark-chocolate-affects-our-arteries/	How Dark Chocolate Affects Our Arteries	Chocolate: delicious beauty or harmful beast? Or both? Although chocolate products can contain high levels of fat and sugar, the cocoa powder itself may have beneficial effects in a number of chronic disease conditions including heart disease. Flow-mediated dilation, measured in the main artery of the arm, is considered one of the best measures of arterial function, a predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Researchers found that a little cocoa can give one a significant boost in arterial function within hours of consumption. It doesn’t take much—just about a teaspoon of natural cocoa powder (or about a tablespoon or more of Dutched cocoa). For a graph of this, check out my video, Dark Chocolate and Artery Function. Now, it might make us a little suspicious that the author of this study works in Hershey, Pennsylvania, at the Hershey Medical Center, and has accepted money from our largest chocolate manufacturer’s Center for Health and Nutrition, conveniently located near the intersection of Chocolate and Cocoa Avenue (seriously!). However, putting together all of the best available evidence, dozens of randomized controlled trials, arterial function was significantly improved within hours, and after weeks and months of chronic cocoa consumption. It’s always difficult to tease fact from fiction when such powerful financial interests are involved though. Many of the other studies were funded by industry as well, and as in all areas of research, evidence suggests that industry funding is associated with pro-industry conclusions. But even after removing studies funded by industry, reviewers found the same protective effect. The reason researchers often measure arterial function in the arm rather than where we really need it—in the coronary arteries of the heart—is that it would require an angiogram, which is a much more invasive procedure. But what if we were able to find people already scheduled for an angiogram anyway? A double-blind, randomized trial of people already scheduled for an angiogram found that dark chocolate actually opens up coronary arteries. When researchers did what’s called a “cold pressor test,” where they plunge subjects’ hands into buckets of ice water, they found that after dark chocolate consumption, arteries actually dilated when they’re normally supposed to constrict. Because chocolate also contains fat and sugar, we have to be careful. Furthermore, most chocolate products are manufactured with milk, an ingredient known to influence the antioxidant capacity in our blood. Even if milk chocolate had the same flavonoid phytonutrient content as dark chocolate, the antioxidant effect of cocoa is potentially weakened in the blood when milk is consumed. So, not only are there triple the antioxidants in dark compared to milk chocolate, but the milk actively works against the effects in the human body. Eat dark chocolate, and we get a nice spike in the antioxidant power of our bloodstreams within an hour. Eat milk chocolate, and we get nothing. If we eat that same dark chocolate with a cup of milk, the benefit is suppressed. The addition of milk, either in your stomach or in the chocolate, inhibits the within-body antioxidant activity of chocolate and the absorption into the bloodstream of one of the target phytonutrients. Sugar isn’t good for us either. Sugar impairs arterial function. One bottle of soda’s worth of sugar can cripple arterial function. That’s why sugar-free cocoa improves arterial function better than the same amount of cocoa with sugar added. So, eliminating sugar appears to amplify the beneficial effects of cocoa. The bottom line is that although the positive effects of chocolate and cocoa products seem apparent, precautions exist when we’re talking about the calories, fat, and sugar in chocolate. Cocoa powder, then, offers the best of both worlds. Although not as tasty, cocoa-based products with little or no sugar or fat are certainly preferred. And we can make them tasty as I note in my Healthy Chocolate Milkshake recipe, and my healthy chocolate ice cream video. More on the corrupting effect of money in nutrition research in Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Conflicts of Interest.

A-136	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/11/03/how-do-broccoli-supplements-compare-to-sprouts/	How Do Broccoli Supplements Compare to Sprouts?	Your parents would have been smart to tell you to to “eat your broccoli.” But what about broccoli sprouts? Or broccoli supplements? There have been a number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials on the use of broccoli sprouts as a complementary treatment in diabetes to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance and fasting blood sugars. In my video, Biggest Nutrition Bang for Your Buck, I describe how to grow our own sprouts simply and quickly in five days. New science suggests, though, that it’s even simpler and quicker than I described. If we look at other sprouts, their antioxidant phytonutrients appear to peak around sprouting day five (up to 10-fold higher than day two), but the sulforaphane content in broccoli sprouts appears to peak at around 48 hours, so 2-day-old sprouts may be even better (See Sulforaphane: From Broccoli to Breast). What if we don’t enjoy eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts but still want the benefits of the broccoli phytonutrients? Do the broccoli supplements on the market work? One group of researchers tested BroccoMax, which boasts a half pound of broccoli’s worth in every capsule. Researchers compared six capsules a day to a cup of broccoli sprouts. In the video, Broccoli: Sprouts vs. Supplements, you can see the spike in broccoli phytonutrients in the bloodstream of those eating sprouts. The cup of broccoli sprouts dramatically outperforms the six capsules at a small fraction of the cost.

A-137	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/29/why-some-dietary-cholesterol-studies-fail-to-show-harm/	Why Some Dietary Cholesterol Studies Fail to Show Harm	How else can we make decisions for ourselves and our families but by the best available balance of evidence? The latest meta-analysis, pooling data from more than a dozen studies involving more than 300,000 people, indicates that there is a dose dependent association between egg consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. But that doesn’t mean every individual study showed evidence of harm. Even though the totality of evidence points to harm, the egg industry can cherry-pick studies that show no apparent effects. If eggs are harmful, why don’t all of the studies on heart disease and egg consumption show significant harm? It may have to do with Geoffrey Rose’s “sick population” concept. If an entire population is sick, then the range of “health” may not be sufficiently broad to establish a significant association. Rose’s paper is one of the most famous papers ever written in preventive medicine and should be required reading for all medical students. Imagine if everyone smoked 20 cigarettes a day. If everybody smoked, then clinical studies, case-control studies, and cohort studies would all lead us to conclude that lung cancer was a genetic disease; and in one sense that would be true. Some smokers get cancer; others lifelong smokers never do. But if everybody smoked, we’d never know that smoking was a risk factor. Thankfully, in the case of cigarettes and lung cancer, it so happened that the original study populations contained about equal numbers of smokers and non-smokers. In such a situation, studies are able to identify smoking as the main risk factor. But take cholesterol. In the video, When Low Risk Means High Risk, you can see the cholesterol levels of the people with and without heart disease in the famous Framingham Heart Study. There’s hardly any difference because practically everybody’s cholesterol was too high; it’s like everyone was a smoker. The painful truth is that even someone at “low risk” for heart disease is likely to die of heart disease. Everyone who eats the standard Western diet is, in fact, a high-risk individual when it comes to heart disease. In a sick population like ours where nearly everyone is eating lots of saturated fat and cholesterol, adding some more saturated fat and cholesterol in the form of eggs may just take us from one sorry state—probably dying from heart disease—to another sorry state—still probably dying from heart disease. So, when the current federal guidelines say we need to particularly restrict dietary cholesterol if we’re at high risk for heart disease, we need to realize that nearly all Americans that live past middle age are at high risk of dying from heart disease—it’s our #1 cause of death. As stroke specialist David Spence and colleagues put it, “A 20-year old man might feel safe smoking and eating egg yolks because his heart attack is 45 years or so in the future. But why would he want to accelerate the progression of his atherosclerotic plaque and bring it on sooner? Stopping egg yolks after the heart attack would be like quitting smoking after lung cancer is diagnosed.” There may in fact be a plateau of risk for smoking, too. Whether we smoke for 25 years or 35 years, our risk for lung cancer may be the same—really high, but about the same. The tobacco industry could truthfully tell someone who’s smoked for most of their lives that, don’t worry, you can keep smoking and your risk of lung cancer won’t go up (conveniently failing to mention that if you’re already at high risk and you quit completely, your risk would drop dramatically). It’s like if you took a raging drunk and had them take a shot of whiskey. In someone who’s hammered, it might not make much difference, but to a teetotaler, a couple shots could have quite an effect. So, it’s like the alcohol industry with a group of drunks saying, see, couple shots, no big deal. But that doesn’t mean it’s not better to be sober. Instead of going from high risk to high risk, better to go to low risk or no risk. This reminds me of what the beef industry tried to pull. See BOLD Indeed: Beef Lowers Cholesterol?

A-138	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/27/topical-application-of-turmeric-curcumin-for-cancer/	Topical Application of Turmeric Curcumin for Cancer	 How about giving turmeric extracts to people who just had bladder cancer taken out? Or to those who have an early stage of squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer caused by arsenic exposure, or early stage cervical cancer, or precancerous lesions in the mouth or stomach? Researchers did this, and in about a quarter of the patients, the lesions started to get better. One out of the two bladder cancer survivors, two out of seven patients with precancerous mouth lesions, one out of six patients with precancerous stomach lesions, one out of four early stage cervical cancer cases, and two out of six patients with early stage skin cancer, all without any noticeable side-effects. One of the reasons turmeric curcumin may work in some cancers better than others, or in some people better than others, is differences in bioavailability. Megadoses were given, yet just a tiny amount ended up in the bloodstream. If we’re treating skin cancer, though, why not just put the curcumin directly on the skin? I’ve talked about what turmeric compounds can do to cancer cells in a petri dish. In the video, Topical Application of Turmeric Curcumin for Cancer, you can see some before and after pics. Cervical cancer cells are laid to waste as more and more curcumin is added, and normal cells are unharmed. But to make it to the cervix, curcumin must be absorbed (though a vaginal cream has been invented). A variety of delivery methods have been devised, including oral, intra-abdominal, intramuscular, under-the-skin injections, straight into the veins or the arteries, on the skin, up the bladder, in the nose, breathed like an inhaler, up where the sun don’t shine, or straight into the spinal column, bone marrow, the tumor itself, or implanted somehow. Taken orally, some curcumin does actually get into the tissues. We can measure the amount of curcumin absorbed into the wall of the intestine by examining biopsies and surgical specimens taken after a curcumin regimen. It makes sense to take turmeric orally to try to fight colon cancer, but if we have cancer erupting on our skin, why not just rub it on directly? That’s what one group of researchers did. They took some turmeric from the store, made a tincture out of it, dried it, put it in Vaseline, and then had cancer patients rub it on their cancer three times a day. What kind of cancer can you get at with a finger? These were folks with cancers of the mouth, breast, skin, vulva, and elsewhere. Isn’t breast cancer under the surface? Not always. Advanced breast cancer can ulcerate right through the skin. The subjects were all people with recurrent ulcerating tumors that had failed to respond to surgery, radiation, and chemo. These open cancers can stink, itch, and ooze, and there was nothing else medicine had to offer. So, they rubbed some turmeric ointment to see what happened. It produced remarkable relief. A reduction in smell was noted in 90% of the cases, even in extensively ulcerated cases of breast cancer, and a reduction in itching in almost all cases as well. For example, treatment relieved severe itching in two of the vulva cancer patients. Most of the lesions dried up, and in many cases this relief lasted for months, all from just rubbing on the harmless spice turmeric, which the researchers describe as “an indigenous drug … highly effective in reducing smell, itching and exudate.” The effect of this so-called drug is remarkable. And that “drug” is just some edible spice used in curries for centuries. More on what this golden spice can do in: There are ways of Boosting the Bioavailability of Curcumin to get it into our blood stream. Some should be cautious about turmeric use, though.

A-139	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/22/preventing-and-treating-colon-cancer-with-turmeric-curcumin/	Preventing and Treating Colon Cancer with Turmeric Curcumin	The low incidence of bowel cancer in India is often attributed to natural antioxidants such as curcumin, the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric, used in curry powder. However, it is important to remember that the benefits of a diet are seldom produced by a single ingredient in that diet. For example, diets rich in beta-carotene lower the risk of tobacco-related cancers, but beta-carotene pills do not. That doesn’t stop researchers from trying, though. Back in 2001, in a last ditch attempt to save the lives of 15 patients with advanced colorectal cancer that didn’t respond to any of the standard chemotherapy agents or radiation, researchers started them on a turmeric extract. The extract appeared to help stall the disease in a third (5 out of 15) of the patients, suggesting that turmeric extract may clinically benefit at least some patients with advanced refractory colorectal cancer. If we were talking about some new kind of chemotherapy, and it only helped one in three, we’d have to weigh the benefits against chemo side effects, such as losing our hair, the sloughing of our guts, intractable vomiting, maybe being bed-ridden. Therefore, a drug scenario, a one in three benefit may not sound particularly appealing. But when we’re talking about plant extract proven to be remarkably safe, it would be worth considering even if it just helped 1 in a 100. With no serious downsides, a one in three benefit for end-stage cancer is pretty exciting. To see if colon cancer could be prevented, five years later, researchers at Cleveland Clinic and John Hopkins School of Medicine tested two phytochemicals, curcumin (from turmeric) and quercitin, (found in fruits and vegetables such as red onions and grapes) in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited form of colon cancer in which individuals develop hundreds of polyps that may become cancerous unless prophylactically removed. (See Turmeric Curcumin and Colon Cancer). Researchers gave supplements of curcumin and quercetin to five such patients who already had their colons removed, but still had either polyps in their rectum or in a little intestinal pouch. Each patient had between 5 and 45 polyps each, but after six months on the supplement they ended up with on average fewer than half the polyps, and the ones that were left had shrunk in half. One patient got rid of all polyps by month three, but then they seemed to come back. The researchers asked the patient what’s what, and it turned out that the patient stopped taking the supplements. So researchers put the patient back on the phytonutrient supplements for another three months, and the polyps came back down with virtually no adverse events and no blood test abnormalities. By studying people at high risk for colon cancer, the researchers were able to show noticeable effects within just months. But polyposis is a rare disease; they were only able to recruit five people for the study. Thankfully, smokers are a dime a dozen. After another five years, researchers put 44 smokers on turmeric curcumin supplements alone for a month and measured changes in their colorectal aberrant crypt foci, which may act like the precursors to polyps, which are the precursors to cancer. After just one month there was a significant drop in the number of these abnormal crypt foci in the high dose supplement group but no change in the low dose group. There were also no dose-limiting side effects (although the stools in the participants did turn yellow). The low cancer rates in India may also be related to phytate consumption  (Phytates for the Prevention of Cancer) and plant-centered diets (Back to Our Roots: Curry and Cancer).

A-141	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/15/how-to-reduce-your-dietary-cadmium-absorption/	How to Reduce Your Dietary Cadmium Absorption	Cadmium is known as a highly toxic metal that represents a major hazard to human health. It sticks around in our body for decades because our body has no efficient way to get rid of it and may contribute to a variety of illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Most recently, data suggests that cadmium exposure may impair cognitive performance even at levels once thought to be safe. Recent studies also suggest that cadmium exposure may produce other adverse health effects at lower exposure levels than previously predicted, including increased risk of hormonal cancers. For example, researchers on Long Island estimated that as much as a third of breast cancer in the U.S. might be associated with elevated cadmium levels. Inhalation of cigarette smoke is one of the major routes for human exposure to cadmium. Seafood consumption is another route of human exposure. The highest levels, though, are found in organ meats. But how many horse kidneys do people eat? Since people eat so few organs, grains and vegetables actually end up contributing the largest amount to our collective diets. However, don’t drop the salad from the menu yet. Whole grains and vegetables are among the major dietary sources of fiber, phytoestrogens, and antioxidants that may protect against breast cancer. Indeed, even though the risk of breast cancer goes up as women consume more and more cadmium, and even though on paper most cadmium comes from grains and vegetables, breast cancer risk goes down the more and more whole grains and vegetables women eat. So, are animal sources of cadmium somehow worse, or do the benefits of plant foods just overwhelm any adverse effects of the cadmium? A study out of the Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand, highlighted in my video, Cadmium and Cancer: Plant vs. Animal Foods, may have helped solve the mystery. It’s not what we eat; it’s what we absorb. Cadmium bioavailability from animal-based foods may be higher than that from vegetable-based foods. There appears to be something in plants that inhibits cadmium absorption. In fact, researchers found when they added kale to boiled pig kidneys, they could cut down on the toxic exposure. Just one tablespoon of pig kidney, and we may exceed the daily safety limit—unless we add kale, in which case we could eat a whole quarter cup. The pronounced effects of the inhibitory factors in kale point out, as the researchers note, “the importance of vegetable foods in terms of prevention of health hazard from [cadmium] ingested as mixed diets in a real situation.” Researchers have concluded: “Even if a vegetarian diet contains more lead and cadmium than a mixed diet, it is not certain that it will give rise to higher uptake of the metals, because the absorption of lead and cadmium is inhibited by plant components such as fiber and phytate.” Having whole grains in our stomach up to three hours before we swallow lead can eliminate 90% of absorption, thought to be due to phytates in whole grains, nuts, and beans grabbing onto it. So, vegetarians may have lower levels of lead and cadmium even though they have higher intakes. In fact, there is a significant decrease in the hair concentrations of lead and cadmium after the change from an omnivorous to a vegetarian diet, indicating a lower absorption of the metals. Researchers took folks eating a standard Swedish diet and put them on a vegetarian diet. The vegetarians were encouraged to eat lots of whole, unrefined plant foods, with no meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Junk food was also discouraged. Within three months on a vegetarian diet, their levels significantly dropped, and stayed down for the rest of the year-long experiment. The researchers came back three years later, three years after the subjects stopped eating vegetarian, and found that their levels of mercury, cadmium, and lead had shot back up. Since the cadmium in plants is based on the cadmium in soil, plant-eaters that live in a really polluted area like Slovakia, which has some of the highest levels, thanks to the chemical and smelting industries, can indeed build up higher cadmium levels, especially if they eat lots of plants. It’s interesting that, “in spite of the significantly higher blood cadmium concentration as a consequence of a greater cadmium intake from polluted plants, all the antioxidants in those same plants were found to help inhibit the harmful effects of higher free radical production caused by the cadmium exposure.” Still, though, in highly polluted areas, it might be an especially good idea not to smoke, or eat too much seafood, or organ meats. But even if we live in the Slovak Republic’s “black triangle of pollution,” the benefits of whole plant foods would outweigh the risks. For people in highly polluted areas, zinc supplements may decrease cadmium absorption, but I’d recommend against multi-mineral supplements, as they have been found to be contaminated with cadmium itself. There are other toxins in cigarette smoke also found in food. See: Toxic metals have also been found in dietary supplements. See for example, Get the Lead Out and Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. Mercury is also a serious problem.

A-142	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/13/reduce-workout-soreness-with-watermelon/	Reduce Workout Soreness With Watermelon	Long-distance runners and cross-fit athletes alike know it well: Delayed-onset muscle soreness is the discomfort that starts the day after a particularly grueling workout, caused by micro-tears in the muscle that lead to inflammation. The leading pharmaceutical interventions are over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, provided people are offered reasonable guidance on the dangers of their use (See Anti-Inflammatory Life is a Bowl of Cherries), but there might be a much safer option. “The use of NSAIDs is associated with serious upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) side-effects, including upset stomach, stomach ulcers, stomach and intestinal bleeding, and perforation.” Of all the NSAIDS, ibuprofen is probably safest (significantly safer than naproxen). Still, there’s a chance you could end up at your doctor’s office for a problem with side effects. The most frequent problem caused by ibuprofen is related to the stomach. However, NSAID drugs can also cause damage to the small intestine. Ibuprofen can cause our guts to become leaky within hours and inflamed within days. Up until the mid-80’s, we thought the small intestine was relatively unaffected by these drugs. Now, we know they may disrupt our intestinal barrier function. There must be a better way to deal with muscle soreness. Previously, I reviewed the role cherries may play in reducing muscle soreness (See Reducing Muscle Soreness with Berries), thought to be because of anti-inflammatory flavonoid nutrients. Interestingly, while the absorption of these phytonutrients can help with exercise, exercise may help with the absorption of these phytonutrients. If you look at each of the individual phytonutrients researchers examined, all of them were significantly better absorbed by the athletes compared to the sedentary controls. The thought is that elite training may modify the activity of the good bacteria in our gut, which then boosts bioavailability. But back to muscle soreness. Is there any other fruit that may help? Researchers in Spain had a group of men engage in intense physical activity after drinking two cups of fresh blended watermelon or a watermelon-free placebo drink, and the next day, those that pre-loaded with watermelon were significantly less sore (around one on a scale of one to five compared to closer to two after placebo). The researchers conclude that “functional compounds in fruits and vegetables play a key role in the design of new natural and functional products (beverages, juices, energy bars, etc.) by the food industry instead of synthetic compounds from the pharmaceutical industry.” (See Watermelon for Sore Muscle Relief). But why design natural products when nature already designed the products we need in the produce aisle?

A-143	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/08/how-to-treat-gout-with-diet/	How to Treat Gout With Diet	The Washington State Fruit Commission, our largest cherry producer, can fund reviews that cherry-pick studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of cherries in a petri dish and animal models. But what we’ve needed are human studies. For example, if we stuff the human equivalent of up to a thousand cups of cherries down the throats of rats, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect, but we could never eat that many. (In fact, if we tried, it could end badly. One poor guy who ate 500 cherries whole—without spitting out the pits—ended up fatally obstructing his colon.) A decade ago, we didn’t have many human studies, but thankfully, now we do. A study published in The Journal of Nutrition had men and women eat about 45 cherries a day for a month (I wouldn’t mind being part of that study!). The researchers found a 25% drop in C-reactive protein levels (a marker of inflammation), as well as an inflammatory protein with an inelegant acronym RANTES (“Regulated on, Activation, Normal, T cell, Expressed, and Secreted”). Even a month after the study ended, there appeared to be residual anti-inflammatory benefit from the cherry fest. These subjects were all healthy, with low levels of inflammation to begin with, but a follow-up study, highlighted in my video, Gout Treatment with a Cherry on Top, on folks with higher levels found similar results for C-reactive protein and for a number of other markers for chronic inflammatory diseases. Do cherries, then, help people who actually have a chronic inflammatory disease? Back in 1950, in an obscure Texas medical journal, “observations made by responsible physicians” suggested that in a dozen patients with gout, eating half a pound of fresh or canned cherries helped prevent flares of gout. But the issue had never seriously been tested, until recently. Gout is an excruciatingly painful inflammatory arthritis caused by the crystallization of uric acid within joints. Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2008, the prevalence of gout in the US is estimated to be 3.9% among US adults, which translates into 8.3 million people. Hundreds of gout sufferers were studied, and cherry intake was associated with a 35% lower risk of gout attacks, with over half the risk gone at three servings measured over a two day period (about 16 cherries a day). That’s the kind of efficacy the researchers saw with a low-purine diet (uric acid is a break-down product of purines). This same research group found that purine intake of animal origin increased the odds for recurrent gout attacks by nearly five-fold. Heavy alcohol consumption isn’t a good idea either. There are some high-purine non-animal foods, like mushrooms and asparagus, but the researchers found no significant link to plant sources of purines. So, the researchers recommended eliminating meat and seafood from the diet. This may decrease risk substantially, and adding cherries on top may decrease risk of gout attacks even further. Same thing with the leading drug: allopurinol works, but adding produce appears to work even better. Often, dietary changes and cherries may be all patients have, as doctors are hesitant to prescribe uric acid-lowering drugs like allopurinol due to rare but serious side-effects. In addition to fighting inflammation, cherries may also lower uric acid levels. Within five hours of eating a big bowl of cherries, uric acid levels in the blood significantly drop. At the same time, antioxidant levels in the blood go up. So, is it just an antioxidant effect? Would other fruit work just as well? No. Researchers tried grapes, strawberries, and kiwi fruit, and none significantly lowered uric acid levels, supporting a specific anti-gout effect of cherries. There are some new gout drugs out now, costing up to $2,000 per dose and carry a “risk of toxicity that may be avoided by using nonpharmacologic treatments or prevention in the first place.” Given the potential harms and high costs, attention ought to be directed to dietary modification, reducing alcohol and meat intake, particularly sardines and organ meats. “If life serves up a bowl of cherries (consumed on a regular basis), the risk of a recurrent gout attack may be meaningfully reduced.” More about the inflammation fighting effects of sweet cherries in my video Anti-inflammatory Life is a Bowl of Cherries.

A-144	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/10/06/which-are-more-anti-inflammatory-sweet-cherries-or-tart-cherries/	Which are More Anti-Inflammatory: Sweet Cherries or Tart Cherries?	Haggis, the national dish of Scotland, is a savory pudding of heart, liver, lungs, and oatmeal traditionally stuffed inside of a stomach. When that stomach goes into our own stomach, our digestive enzymes and stomach acid have no problem digesting it away. How do our bodies digest the stomach lining of a sheep on our plate without digesting our own stomach linings? It’s meat and we’re meat.  So, why don’t we digest our own stomach every time we eat? Partly because we have an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) that protects the lining of our stomach. There are two types, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is thought to be the primary protector of our stomach, whereas COX-2 is an enzyme responsible for pain and inflammation. In fact, anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen work by inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme. But these are non-selective drugs; so, in addition to inhibiting COX-2 they also inhibit COX-1, which is trying to protect our stomach linings. Thus, although drugs like ibuprofen are great at relieving pain and inflammation, they kill thousands every year due to ulcerations through the stomach wall that result in life-threatening bleeding and perforation. What are the risks on an individual level? On average, one in about 1,200 people who take this class of drugs for at least two months will die as a result. To put this into perspective, we can compare the death rate from anti-inflammatory drug side-effects to the risks associated with some well-known events. For example, it may be safer to go bungee jumping a few hundred times. What we need is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, inhibiting the pain and inflammation of COX-2 without inhibiting the stomach protection of COX-1. We thought we got it with Vioxx, a blockbuster drug that brought in billions in profits before it started killing tens of thousands of peoples. Internal emails reveal how the drug manufacturer responded to the revelation that they were killing people:  They drew up a list of doctors who were trying to warn people to “neutralize” them. If that didn’t work, they tried to discredit them (You can see the emails in the video, Anti-inflammatory Life Is a Bowl of Cherries). We’re left then with two options: death from internal bleeding from one type of drug or death from side effects from another type of drug. If only there was some sort of natural COX-2 inhibitor. There is: cherries, which unlike ibuprofen suppress COX-2 more than COX-1. In videos I did on insomnia and reducing muscle soreness (See Tart Cherries for Insomnia and Reducing Muscle Soreness with Berries), I talked about the benefits of sour cherries, the types of cherries used in baking. But sweet cherries, the kind you eat fresh, seem to be the MVP for COX-2 inhibition. Tart cherries had less of an effect. Regular red sweet cherries (Bing sweet cherries) were shown to have a greater anti-inflammatory activity than tart cherries. This makes sense since we think it may be the anthocyanin phytonutrients, and there are much more in sweet red cherries than in tart, and nearly none in yellow Rainer cherries. Because fresh cherries have limited availability, what about other cherry products? In terms of anthocyanin phytonutrients, fresh is best, but frozen would appear to be the second-best choice. Here are two ways I incorporate cherries into my diet: Other studies in which anti-inflammatory drugs were compared to natural dietary remedies include: Turmeric Curcumin and Osteoarthritis and Turmeric Curcumin and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Anti-inflammatory activity in a test tube is one thing, but can cherries actually be used clinically to treat inflammatory diseases?

But hip fractures can be devastating too. Has your doctor laid out all the risks and benefits? I do my best in a two-part video series coming soon on NutritionFacts.org: If you want to watch both videos now, though, they are available as a video download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 27 (all proceeds go to charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD. The calcium videos are both scheduled to go up on NutritionFacts.org in November, but you can download and watch them right now. Other videos included in the volume that I expect may be popular include Should We All Get Colonoscopies Starting at Age 50? and Find Out If Your Doctor Takes Drug Company Money. The current batch of videos from volume 26 on NutritionFacts.org just ran out, so starting this month and running until December, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 27. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–50+ hours of video–you can get the complete DVD collection. Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads. If you were a regular supporter, you’d already be a calcium (and colonoscopy!) expert by now, having already received the new DVD. I come out with new DVDs every 9 weeks.

A-146	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/29/where-do-you-get-your-fiber/	Where Do You Get Your Fiber?	Vegetarians and vegans are all too familiar with the question: Where do you get your protein? Well, we can finally put to rest the question of whether vegetarians get enough protein thanks to a large study that compared the nutrient profiles of about 30,000 non-vegetarians to 20,000 vegetarians and about 5,000 vegans, 5,000 flexitarians (vegetarian most of the time), and 5,000 pescetarians (no meat except fish). The average requirement is 42 grams of protein a day. As you can see in the graph in the video, Do Vegetarians Get Enough Protein, meat eaters get way more than they need, and so does everyone else. Vegetarians and vegans average 70% more protein than the recommendation every day. It’s surprising that there’s so much fuss about protein in this country when less than 3% of adults don’t make the cut, presumably because they’re on extreme calorie-restricted diets and aren’t eating enough food period. But 97% of Americans get enough protein. There is a nutrient, though, for which 97% of Americans are deficient. That nutrient is fiber. Less than 3% of Americans get even the recommended minimum adequate intake of fiber. That’s something we really have to work on. On average, we get only about 15 grams a day. The minimum daily requirement is 31.5, so we get less than half the minimum. Men are particularly deficient. If we break down intake by age and gender, after studying the diets of 12,761 Americans, the percent of men between ages 14 and 50 getting the minimum adequate intake is zero. (The only nutrient Americans may be more deficient in than fiber is potassium. See 98% of American Diets Potassium Deficient.) This deficit is stunning in that dietary fiber has been protectively associated in population studies with the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and various cancers as well high cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugars. Therefore, it is not surprising that fiber is listed as a nutrient of concern reported by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. Protein is not. One problem is that most people have no idea what’s in their food; more than half of Americans think steak is a significant fiber source. By definition, fiber is only found in plants. There is no fiber in meat, dairy or eggs, and little or no fiber in junk food. Therein lies the problem. Americans should be eating more beans, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains—but how are they doing? 96% of Americans don’t eat the minimum recommended daily amount of beans, 96% don’t eat the measly minimum for greens, and 99% don’t get enough whole grains. Nearly the entire U.S. population fails to eat enough whole plant foods. Even semi-vegetarians make the fiber minimum, though. Those eating completely plant-based diets triple the average American intake. When closing the fiber gap, you’ll want to do it gradually though, no more than about five extra grams a day each week until you can work your way up. But it’s worth it. “Plant-derived diets tend to contribute significantly less fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and food-borne pathogens, while at the same time offering more fiber, folate, vitamin C, and phytochemicals, all essential factors for disease prevention, optimal health, and well being.” And the more whole plant foods the better. If we compare the nutritional quality of vegan versus vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian and omnivorous diets, traditional healthy diet indexing systems consistently indicate that the most plant-based diet is the healthiest one. For more on how S.A.D. the Standard American Diet is, see Nation’s Diet in Crisis. Americans eating meat-free diets average higher intakes of nearly every nutrient. See my video Nutrient-Dense Approach to Weight Management. Isn’t animal protein higher quality protein though?

A-147	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/24/exercise-as-medicine/	Exercise as Medicine	Physical inactivity has been called the biggest public health problem of the 21st century. Of course, just because someone calls it that doesn’t mean it’s true; in fact, physical inactivity ranks down at #5 in terms of risk factors for death, and #6 in terms of risk factors for disability. Diet is by far our greatest killer, followed by smoking. But, there is irrefutable evidence of the “effectiveness of regular physical activity in the prevention of several chronic diseases—cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, obesity, depression, osteoporosis, and premature death”—helping to add years to our life, and above all, “life to our years.” It truly may be survival of the fittest. How much exercise do we need? In general, the answer is the more the better. Currently, “most health and fitness organizations advocate a minimum of a thousand calories of exercise a week,” which is equivalent to walking an hour a day five days a week. Seven days a week, though, may be even better in terms of extending one’s lifespan. Exercise is so important that not walking an hour a day is considered a high risk behavior, alongside smoking, excess drinking, and being obese. Having any one of these effectively ages us three to five years in terms of risk of dying prematurely, though interestingly those who ate green vegetables on a daily basis did not appear to have that same bump in risk. Even if broccoli-eating couch potatoes live as long as walkers, there are a multitude of ancillary health benefits to physical activity such that doctors are encouraged to prescribe it, to signal to the patient that “exercise is medicine.” Researchers at the London School (of Economics and Political Science), Harvard, and Stanford compared exercise to drug interventions in a study highlighted in my video, Longer Life Within Walking Distance, and found that exercise often worked just as well as drugs for the treatment of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. There’s not a lot of money to fund exercise studies.  So, one option would be to require drug companies to compare any new drug to exercise. In cases where drug options provide only modest benefit, patients deserve to understand the relative impact that physical activity might have on their condition. Exercise is just one of four lifestyle behaviors found to significantly extend our lifespan. See my video, Turning the Clock Back 14 Years. Other longevity videos include: More videos on exercise: What about the stress it can put on our bodies?

A-148	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/22/eliminate-most-of-your-chronic-disease-risk-in-four-easy-steps/	Eliminate Most of Your Chronic Disease Risk in Four Steps	In 1903, Thomas Edison predicted that the doctor of the future will give no medicine, but instead “instruct his patient in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.” A hundred and one years later, the American College of Lifestyle Medicine was born. Lifestyle docs like myself still prescribe meds when necessary, but, based on the understanding that the leading causes of disability and death in the United States are caused mostly by lifestyle, our emphasis is particularly on what we put in our mouths: food and cigarettes. An “impressive number of studies have shown that lifestyle is the root cause of what ails us.” The good news is that by changing our lifestyle we can dramatically improve our health. You have the power. We’ve known for a long time that for most of the leading causes of death our genes account for at most 10 to 20% of risk, given that rates of killers like heart disease and major cancers differ up to a 100-fold among various populations, and that when people migrate from low- to high-risk countries, their disease rates almost always change to those of the new environment. For example, at least 70% of strokes and colon cancer are avoidable, as are over 80% of coronary heart disease and over 90% of type 2 diabetes. So maybe it’s “time we stop blaming our genes and focus on the 70% that is under our control.” That may be the real solution to the health care crisis. It doesn’t take much. Adhering to just four simple healthy lifestyle factors can have a strong impact on the prevention of chronic diseases: not smoking, not being obese, exercising half an hour a day, and eating healthier (more fruits, veggies, whole grains, less processed foods and meat). Four simple things cut our risk of developing a chronic disease by 78%. 95% of diabetes risk out the window, 80% of heart attack risk, gone. Half of stroke risk, a third of cancer risk, simply gone. Think of what that means in terms of the numbers. As it stands now, each year a million Americans experience their first heart attack or stroke, a million get diabetes, a million get cancer. Do we actually get to live longer, too? The CDC followed about 8,000 Americans 20 years or older for about six years. They found that three cardinal lifestyle behaviors exerted an enormous impact on mortality. People who do not smoke, consume a healthy diet, and engage in sufficient physical activity can substantially reduce their risk for early death. By “not smoking” they just meant not currently smoking; by “healthy diet” they just meant in the top 40% in terms of complying with the rather wimpy federal dietary guidelines; and by being “physically active” they just meant averaging about 21 minutes a day or more of at least moderate exercise. Those that managed at least one of the three had a 40% lower risk of dying. Those that hit two out of three cut their chances of dying by more than half. Those that scored all three threw 82% of their chances of dying in those six years out the window. What does that mean in terms of how much longer we get to live? A similar study on health behaviors and survival, highlighted in my video, Turning the Clock Back 14 Years, didn’t just take people’s word for how healthfully they were eating, they measured the level of vitamin C in people’s blood, a biomarker for how many plants they were eating, and the drop in mortality risk in those nailing all healthy behaviors was equivalent to being 14 years younger. I discuss the role diet may play in preventing the 15 leading causes of death in my 2012 annual review video Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death. How does your diet compare? Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score. I go into depth into the exercise component in my video Longer Life Within Walking Distance.

A-149	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/17/how-much-longer-do-fruit-and-vegetable-eaters-live/	How Much Longer Do Fruit- & Vegetable-Eaters Live?	Probably the least controversial advice in all of nutrition is to eat more fruits and vegetables, which is to say, eat more plants, since the term vegetable basically means all parts of the plant that aren’t fruit. We’ve known that eating more fruits and vegetables helps us live longer, but a new study helped us see exactly how much longer (featured in my video Fruits, Veggies, and Longevity: How Many Minutes Per Mouthful?). Researchers in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition followed people and their diets over time to create a dose-response curve between fruit and vegetable consumption and mortality. Subjects who consumed five fruits and vegetables a day lived an extra three years compared to their non-plant-eating counterparts. Compared to those eating five servings of fruits and veggies a day, those who ate four lost a month off their lifespan. Those who ate three servings lost three months. Then the curve started going off the cliff. At two servings a day, subjects lived seven months shorter, and at one serving a day, practically a year and a half, at half a serving a day, subjects lived nearly two years less, and at zero servings subjects lost three years. This study mostly looked at people in their 50’s and 60’s. Is it too late by our 70’s? No. Women in their 70’s with the most carotenoid phytonutrients in their bloodstream were twice as likely to survive five years than those with the lowest. This means doubling one’s likelihood of survival merely by eating some more fruits and vegetables. In a study out of Taiwan, researchers concluded that spending just 50 cents a day on fruits or vegetables could buy people about a 10% drop in mortality. That’s quite a bargain. Imagine if there was a drug that—without side-effects—could lower our risk of death 10%. How much do you think drug companies would charge? Probably more than 50 cents. The more plants we eat, the more antioxidants we get. Why is this important? See The Power of NO and the Mitochondrial Theory of Aging. Or in terms of specific diseases, Food Antioxidants and Cancer and Food Antioxidants, Stroke, and Heart Disease. Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score to see how one might maximize the intake of protective foods. Nuts are technically just a dried fruit with (typically) a single seed;  so, no wonder Nuts May Help Prevent Death. Botanically speaking beans are fruit too. Check out Increased Lifespan From Beans.

A-150	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/15/my-new-book-how-not-to-die-is-now-available-for-pre-order/	My New Book HOW NOT TO DIE is Now Available for Pre-Order!	It’s hard to express how excited I am that How Not to Die is going to be out soon! Pre-order it now at http://www.NutritionFacts.org/book (all my proceeds go to keep this site running). When I started writing this book, I thought of it as just another platform through which I could share the same body of nutrition work that exists here on NutritionFacts.org. Now, more than a year later, How Not to Die has turned into so much more. It’s actually two books in one. Part 1: The Why Part 1 is a compilation of the most exciting life-changing nutrition research published over the last century. I’ve recorded more than 1,000 videos for NutritionFacts.org, each offering snapshots of some of the most interesting cutting-edge science. The reason I create annual year-in-review presentations is to synthesize the year’s highlights into a more coherent form. The book has enabled me to wrap up decades of groundbreaking discoveries in one place. It’s like my life’s work (so far! :) distilled into about 600 pages. So on one hand, How Not to Die can be considered a reference book with its 100+ pages of references, gathering together all the most persuasive evidence in one place, including much that isn’t yet up on the site. Woven throughout are patient stories and personal anecdotes and as much humor as I could pack in. But that’s just part 1. The book evolved into so much more. Part 2: The How Part 2 is going to be everyone’s favorite. With sections like “What Would Dr. Greger Eat?” I take a deep dive into how I’ve personally translated the mountain of available evidence into my own daily diet. Even for people who’ve seen a thousand of my videos, questions remain, such as what are the best-of-the-best things to include in one’s diet, as well as how much of them to eat and how often? I developed two simple tools for part 2 of the book. The first is a Traffic Light system to quickly identify green-light, yellow-light, and red-light foods and what role each category might play in an optimal diet. The second is my Daily Dozen checklist of all the things I try to fit into each day–how many greens to eat, how much turmeric to sprinkle, which supplements I take, how much exercise to get, etc. For most of these questions there are not clear answers in the scientific literature, so I’ve been hesitant to recommend specifics on the website. But in the book I offer my professional opinion, based on the best available (yet still incomplete) evidence, as to how to best feed ourselves and our families for optimal health and longevity. It’s been something I’ve been itching to do and am so excited to have this new platform in which to do it. I hope you’ll consider pre-ordering How Not to Die now! Why Pre-Order? The book will be available in major retailers on December 8, 2015, in time for the holidays and the burst of New Year resoluting. I’ve got a great publisher, Flatiron (a division of Macmillan), who will do their best to book me through all the big media outlets, but their success depends in part on whether I can get on the New York Times Best Seller List. Listing depends on weekly retail sales compared to sales of other books in the same category. Evidently it’s tough to get on the hardcover “advice/how-to” list, especially at that time of the year, but all pre-order sales from now until launch date all count for sales in that first week. So if the book can build up enough pre-orders, then the blitz of sales going out that first day may take me over the top. I don’t receive a penny from the book. I put it in the contract that all the money I would normally receive from the advance and sales and royalties instead all go directly to the 501c3 nonprofit charity that keeps NutritionFacts.org alive (and from which I receive no compensation–other than all the warm fuzzies I get from helping everyone! :). The more the book sells, not only the more support NutritionFacts.org gets, but the more opportunity I may have to broadcast this message of dietary sanity to the world. Wouldn’t it be amazing if I could get on one of the big morning shows or get my own PBS special? With your help we can reach that many more millions. So please pre-order a copy for yourself, and however many copies you think you may be able to gift to friends and family to get them on the right track for the new year (and the rest of their long healthy life!). And if you’re active on social media, please help me get the word out by directing folks to the pre-order page. I’ll be using the hashtag #HowNotToDie And you could WIN some great prizes! To encourage pre-orders we’re launching a How Not to Die contest where you can win one of dozens of prizes, like signed books, DVDs, and Daily Dozen fridge magnets. Go to http://www.NutritionFacts.org/book for details on how to enter and win. It’s been a long journey to get this book out. At first, I thought of writing it as just a way to get my past work into book form to reach a new audience. But as I started pouring my soul into it and coming up with so much new material, I became more and more excited. Instead of just reviewing the latest science, this book has finally allowed me the opportunity to lay out all my personal recommendations based on the preponderance of available evidence. Now that it’s on the cusp of release I’m just trembling with excitement for everyone to read it. 	-	book,HowNotToDie	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.NutritionFacts.org/book,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/	
A-151	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/10/how-plants-can-be-both-safer-and-more-effective/	How Plants Can be Both Safer and More Effective	During the last decade, the drug industry has followed an assumption that a single drug hitting a single target was the “rational” way to design drugs. We’re learning that Mother Nature may be a bit too complicated for that. “Strategies for targeting single genes or proteins ignore a very important fact that most, if not all diseases, involve a sophisticated network system.” For example, one little family of immune molecules involves about 50 different keys fitting into about 20 different locks, often acting with redundancy, making selection of an appropriate drug to antagonize one key or one lock ineffective in the long run. A whole list of agents has been developed to target a specific molecule for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, for example, but they have all flopped. That’s why drug companies are now working on so-called “promiscuous” drugs that try to affect multiple pathways simultaneously. Meanwhile, since ancient times, natural agents derived from plants—fruits, vegetables, spices, beans, and grains—have been preferred as potential therapeutics for most chronic diseases, not only because of their safety, affordability, and long-term use, but also “for their ability to target multiple cell signaling pathways, a therapeutic virtue.” (See Magic Bullets vs. Promiscuous Plants). One example of a successful promiscuous plant-based drug is aspirin. It doesn’t just target inflammation and offer pain relief, but can act as a blood thinner and help prevent preeclampsia and even some types of cancer. Curcumin is another hopeful plant-based medicine. Aspirin is an extract of the willow tree bark (and is present in other fruits and vegetables); curcumin is an extract of turmeric root. It’s so anti-inflammatory that it may even work through the skin—a traditional use was to wrap sprains and injuries with turmeric soaked poultices, a use that continues to this day. Curcumin is so anti-inflammatory that it can help counter the effects of mustard gas. In a petri dish, curcumin extinguishes the response of spleen cells to an inflammatory cytokine. Promising effects have also been observed in patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases. One of the great things about curcumin is that it also appears to be very safe. One of the reasons may be that despite its powerful pharmacological effects, the same pathway promiscuity that may account for its effectiveness may act synergistically to neutralize side-effects. For example, turmeric has been traditionally used as a bronchodilator to open airways in conditions like asthma. Many of the adrenaline-like drugs that do the same thing can raise blood pressure. The reason turmeric doesn’t may be because it has different components with opposing activities, such as calcium channel-blocking effects that may actually lower blood pressure, and so the side effects may cancel each other out. This strength in promiscuity, though, is also a weakness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been reluctant to approve plant extracts, which by definition are composed of mixtures of different compounds. It’s a Catch-22. One drug, one chemical, one mechanism of action and you can patent it, get FDA approval, and make a billion off it, but it may not work very well. On the other hand, there might be a safe, natural alternative that works better, but industry and the government may not be interested. However, there is hope on the horizon. The FDA approved a green tea ointment as a prescription drug for the treatment of genital warts (See Treating Genital Warts with Green Tea), making it the first prescription plant approved in the United States. If you think that’s neat, check out Treating Gorlin Syndrome With Green Tea. So have drug companies abandoned their model and started pouring money into plants? No. “Having discovered that so-called magic bullet has been largely unsuccessful, they just propose creating non-selective drugs. Instead of magic bullets, magic shotguns.” I go into more detail about the Catch-22 in my last video Plants as Intellectual Property – Patently Wrong? Aspirin isn’t just found in willow tree bark, but throughout the plant kingdom, including fruits and vegetables. See: Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods. My video Power Plants shows how plant foods are not to be underestimated.

A-152	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/08/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/	Plants as Intellectual Property: Patently Wrong?	Since ancient times, Mother Nature has been a fertile source for drugs used to treat human diseases. One such remedy is the spice turmeric, specifically known for its naturally-yellow compound, curcumin, which has been used for at least 2,500 years. In light of the long and established experience with curcumin as a foodstuff and safe, low-cost, effective medicine, the spice is moving rapidly from the kitchen shelf toward the clinic. Curcumin has shown some promising effects against a wide range of diseases, so well in fact that curcumin appears to possess all the desirable features of a designed-from-scratch, multipurpose drug. If it’s so safe and effective, why aren’t more studies being done? Part of the delay is attributable to a U.S. patent, granted in 1995 to researchers at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, for curcumin’s wound-healing properties, which prevented its development as a therapeutic. In a landmark case, highlighted in my video, Plants as Intellectual Property: Patently Wrong?, the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research spent years arguing and finally proved that curcumin has been part of the Indian traditional system of medicine for centuries and so should be considered part of the public domain. It’s like patenting broccoli. The patent was finally over-turned in 1997, a triumph for those trying to stop the misappropriation of traditional knowledge by multinational corporations. But if no one profits, who’s going to pay for research? Given that public knowledge does not involve any intellectual property, drug companies are not interested in its commercialization. You can buy turmeric in any grocery store for pennies a dose. “Unless there is intellectual property to make money, nobody will come forward,” said a leading turmeric researcher. Then how is any research being funded? Although curcumin itself is no longer patentable, derivatives, formulations, delivery systems, and synthetic methods can be. So, if you take some turmeric molecule and tweak it a little bit, you can patent it for your investors. Unless phytonutrients can be converted into new chemical entities for which more specific medical claims are possible, the development of these plants seems unlikely. Sure, they’re extensively exploited as active ingredients of innumerable products on ill-regulated food supplement markets, but apart from this, progress through clinical trials remains sluggish. “Such waste of resources on the way of transformation from renewable materials to high tech/high value products … is deplorable,” drug research scientists write. So maybe it would be good if Frito-Lay did own the patent to broccoli. There’s a reason we don’t see Super Bowl ads for vegetables. This reminds me of my video The Lie That Heals: Should Doctors Give Placebos? I went into the topic thinking one thing, but realized that there are strong arguments to be made on both sides. Turmeric is pretty amazing stuff. Even if we won’t hear about most of the research because companies can’t patent it, we can educate ourselves: The concept that the curcumin in turmeric is able to target multiple diseases pathways simultaneously is explored further in my video, Magic Bullets vs. Promiscuous Plants. 	-	alternative medicine,broccoli,complementary medicine,cost savings,curcumin,India,industry influence,marketing,medications,patent,phytonutrients,spices,supplements,turmeric,wound healing	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-lie-that-heals-should-doctors-give-placebos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23143785,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/magic-bullets-vs-promiscuous-plants/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22887802,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-lie-that-heals-should-doctors-give-placebos/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17803897,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-as-intellectual-property-patently-wrong/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23285683,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-153	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/03/why-certain-plant-compounds-may-mimic-dietary-restriction/	Why Certain Plant Compounds May Mimic Dietary Restriction	A new concept, called xenohormesis, has arisen to explain the mystery of why so many plant molecules interact with and modulate key regulators of our physiology in ways that are beneficial to our health (explained further in my video, Xenohormesis: What Doesn’t Kill Plants May Make Us Stronger). Basically, hormesis is the biological principle of “no pain, no gain.” Mild stresses like exercise can trigger a protective response that leads to strengthened defenses in the long run. But instead of exposing ourselves to the stressor to trigger our bodies’ defenses and shore up protection against future stressors, why not let plants take the hit? Let the plants get stressed because, incredibly, the stress response molecules in plants may activate the same protective responses in humans. Xenohormesis “explains how environmentally stressed plants produce bioactive compounds that can confer stress resistance and survival benefits to animals that consume them.” We can piggyback off of their sophisticated stress response. Indeed, the majority of known health-beneficial effects of edible plants are attributable to the pharmacologically active substances of plants’ stress responses. Hormesis may be why dietary restriction can lead to lifespan extension. The mild stress placed upon the body by not eating enough may activate a wide variety of protective pathways within the body, ramping up anti-inflammatory and antioxidant defenses. Our bodies are preparing themselves for the coming famine they think is about to occur. So is there a way to exploit the benefits of dietary restriction to prevent chronic disease? Obviously, “chronically restricting food intake is not a realistic health strategy for the majority of people—it’s hard for most people to even cut food intake 10-20%, [given the powerful evolutionary drive to eat]. A more feasible alternative may be to activate dietary restriction-induced stress response pathways by other means.” In other words, xenohormesis. If we starve plants, they do the same thing mammals do: activate preservation pathways. So let’s let the plant face the adversity to create the molecules that trigger cell stress resistance, alter metabolism, and improve disease resistance, and then just come along and appropriate them for the same uses in our own bodies. The reason phytonutrients like resveratrol in grapes, curcumin in the spice turmeric, and ECGC in green tea are called “dietary restriction mimetics” is that they mimic the physiological effects of dietary restriction. This may be no coincidence, because the plants produced these compounds to save their own green butts from scarcity. So instead of having to walk around starving all the time, thanks to xenohormesis, we may be able to let the plants bear the brunt and enable us to harness other species’ hardships as a means to promote our own health. If this subject interests you, make sure you see my video where I introduce the topic: Appropriating Plant Defenses. I previously introduced the concept of hormesis in my videos Enhanced Athletic Recovery Without Undermining Adaptation and Is Liquid Smoke Carcinogenic?

A-154	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/09/01/how-humans-benefit-from-stressed-plants/	How Humans Benefit from Stressed Plants	Plants live the ultimate sedentary lifestyle—most of us usually think of plants more as objects than as organisms. Because plants can’t move, they’ve had to evolve a whole other way to escape threats to their well-being. Plants can “sense and respond dynamically to all sorts of stimuli: chemical concentrations in the air and soil, water, touch, motion, vibration, pathogens, predators, and, of course, light.” How do they respond? Biochemically. They manufacture, from scratch, a dizzying array of compounds to deal with specific threats. If we get too hot, we can move into the shade. If plants get too hot, they’re stuck—they are the shade! As a result, “the complexity of the plant stress response humbles that of animals. Plants and their stress response have been evolving for almost a billion years.” And in that time they’ve created a whole chemistry lab of protective substances, some of which can induce similarly protective responses in those of us who eat them. The “best grapes in terms of health benefit often grow in relatively dry, sun-exposed, infertile soil. Similarly, drought-stressed strawberries have more antioxidants and phytonutrients. Indeed, commonly consumed foods like lettuce and fruits can be nutritionally enhanced by cold stress, light stress, water deficit, or nutrient deficit stress.” Why are stressed plants often the healthiest? Studies (such as those highlighted in my video, Appropriating Plant Defenses) suggest that plants and animals largely share the same molecular pathways in order to respond to stress, so it’s conceivable that a molecule produced in plants can also be effective in people. Plants have DNA; humans have DNA. The UV rays in sunlight can damage the DNA in plants in the same way it can damage our DNA (by creating free radicals). Plants figured out how to cook up all these complex antioxidants, and instead of reinventing the wheel, animals can just expropriate those antioxidants from plants and commandeer them for the same purpose. We get attacked by bacteria; plants and fungi get attacked by bacteria. When a particular fungus is getting muscled in on by bacteria, it creates a molecule called penicillin–provided free for us. When plants get infected, they produce aspirin (See Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods), which can come in handy when we get infected. Plants heal wounds; we heal wounds, using similar fatty-acid signaling systems. It is “increasingly evident that plants and animals differ less than we thought in how we respond to stimuli, sharing elements of fatty acid, protein, steroidal, neurotransmitter, free radical, nitric oxide, and even plant growth hormone signaling systems.” So in a sense, we’re just opening up nature’s drug store when we pull out the crisper in our fridge. This whole co-evolution concept reminds me of Human Neurotransmitters In Plants and The Broccoli Receptor: Our First Line of Defense. More on the power of plants in Power Plants.

A-155	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/27/hives-from-tick-bite-induced-meat-allergies/	Hives from Tick Bite-Induced Meat Allergies	In a previous video Alpha Gal and the Lone Star Tick, I started talking about a tick bite-induced meat allergy, called Alpha-Gal, that is unlike any other food allergy we know. The most interesting feature of the reactions may be that first symptoms can occur hours after eating meat. Normally, an allergic reaction to a bee sting, for example, happens within minutes. With this meat allergy, we could have a piece of bacon for breakfast, and our throat wouldn’t start closing off until the afternoon. Because the cause and effect are temporarily separated, we often blame other factors, such as what we ate for lunch, or we just call it “spontaneous” or “idiopathic” anaphylaxis, which is just doctor-speak for “we have no idea what the cause is.” The delay likely occurs because the alpha-gal is probably absorbed along with the fat in meat, given that the allergic reaction occurring four to five hours after meat ingestion corresponds to the peak absorption time of fatty acids from the intestinal tract. What makes the allergy even more difficult to diagnose is that the majority of victims experience only occasional overt reactions, despite regular meat consumption. Fattier meats, like pork rinds, may provoke episodes more consistently and severely, but still don’t trigger a reaction every time. Tick bite-induced meat allergy is on the rise. Ten years ago we didn’t even know this thing existed, but now in tick-ridden states as many as 20% of the population have these anti-meat allergic antibodies (See Tick Bites, Meat Allergies, and Chronic Urticaria). And more and more people are coming in affected, though probably no more than 10% who test positive go on to experience hives or serious allergic reaction to meat. We’re also seeing it more and more in kids. Researchers in Virginia have found that it is not uncommon, though identification of the allergy may not be straightforward. Unlike in adults, who frequently present with systemic reactions, the majority of children with this syndrome present with just skin manifestations, such as hives. However, this doesn’t mean it’s not serious. In fact, nearly half the kids ended up in the ER, and about 1 in 12 needed to be hospitalized. Up to a quarter of the population breaks out in hives at some time in their lives, but some children can be affected for weeks or months. It can be triggered by infections, foods, drugs, parasites, or be autoimmune, but in a large subset of cases we don’t know what the trigger is, and so, call it chronic “idiopathic” urticaria. It’s a common thing pediatricians see. The only cure is avoiding and eliminating whatever is triggering it, but in three quarters of cases, we have no clue. We now know that many children who had been diagnosed with mysterious hives or allergic reactions and may have been specifically told that the reactions were not a result of a food allergy, may have actually been suffering from anti-gal meat allergies. The serious nature of the reactions and the rising frequency of allergic swelling and hives across all age groups underscore the importance of identifying what’s going on, and physicians should keep this new diagnosis in mind. Allergies to meat might be more common than previously thought, as much as 2% of the population (which would mean millions of people). But to put this in context, Americans are much more likely to suffer an anaphylactic reaction due to seafood, tick bite or not, no matter where they live. A national survey of emergency rooms found shellfish was by far the most frequently implicated food, and unlike many other allergies, kids don’t tend to outgrow fish and shellfish allergies. Some fish allergies are actually allergies not to the fish, but to worms in the fish, like anisakis, which are found particularly in cods, anchovies, and squids. Exposure to these parasites in fishes, living or dead, is a widespread problem. In fact, we can even have an allergic reaction to the parasitic fish worm when we eat chickens that were fed on fishmeal. This is one of the ways someone who’s allergic to fish could get triggered by chicken. Because of these worms, researchers recommend that people stop eating seafood and sushi altogether, because besides inducing allergenic reactions, the worms may cause a leaky gut syndrome, which often is unrecognized and can predispose someone to other, more important pathologies than just being itchy all over. I previously covered anisakis in Allergenic Fish Worms and other allergenic parasite reactions in Chronic Headaches and Pork Tapeworms. The worms might not be the only thing increasing allergies in fish.

A-156	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/25/how-a-tick-bite-can-lead-to-food-allergies/	How a Tick Bite Can Lead to Food Allergies	In the beginning, Aristotle defined two forms of life on planet Earth: plants and animals. Two thousand years later, the light microscope was invented and we discovered tiny, single-celled organisms like amoebas. Then, the electron microscope was invented and we discovered better characterized bacteria. Finally, in 1969, biologists recognized fungi as a separate category, and we’ve had at least five kingdoms of life ever since. In my video, Higher Quality May Mean Higher Risk, I talk about the potential downsides of consuming proteins from within our own kingdom, such as the impact our fellow animal proteins can have on boosting our liver’s production of a cancer-promoting hormone called IGF-1. In Eating Outside Our Kingdom, I talked about other potential advantages of preferably dipping into the plant and mushroom kingdoms for dinner, not only from a food safety perspective (we’re more likely to get infected by animal pathogens than Dutch Elm Disease), but because of the potential for cross-reactivity between animal and human proteins. Our immune system is more likely to get confused between a chicken leg and our own legs than it is with a banana, so there may be less potential to trigger an autoimmune reaction, like degenerative brain diseases or inflammatory arthritis (See Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis). In attacking some foreign animal meat protein, some of our own similarly composed tissues may get caught in the crossfire. It’s not just proteins. If you remember the Neu5Gc story (see Inflammatory Meat Molecule Neu5GC), sialic acid in other animals may cause inflammation in our arteries (see  Nonhuman Molecules Lining Our Arteries) and help breast tumors and other human cancers to grow (see How Tumors Use Meat to Grow: Xeno-Autoantibodies). Now a new twist has been added to the story. The reason Neu5Gc triggers inflammation is because humans lost the ability to make it two million years ago, and so when our body is exposed to it through animal products, it’s treated as a foreign molecule, causing inflammation. But there’s also another oligosaccharide called alpha-gal that humans, chimps, and apes lost the ability to make 2 million years ago, but is still made by a variety of animals, including many animals we eat. Anti-gal antibodies may be involved in a number of detrimental processes that may result in allergic, autoimmune, and autoimmune-like diseases, such as auto-immune thyroid disorders. We see higher levels of anti-gal antibodies in Crohn’s disease victims. These antibodies even react against about half of human breast tumors, and we can find them in atherosclerotic plaques in people’s necks. However, those are all mostly speculative risks. We do know that alpha-gal is a major obstacle to transplanting pig organs, like kidneys, into people, because our bodies reject alpha-gal as foreign. In fact, alpha-gal is thought to be the major target for human anti-pig antibodies. It’s interesting that if we look at those that abstain from pork for whatever reason, they have fewer swine-specific immune cells in their bloodstream. Researchers speculate that oral intake of pork could ferry swine molecules into the bloodstream via gut-infiltrating lymphocytes to prime the immune response. So we can have an allergic reaction to eating pig kidneys too, but such severe meat allergies were considered rare, until an unusual report surfaced. First described in 2009, the report included details on 24 cases of meat allergies triggered by tick bites. Within a year, it was obvious that the cases should be counted in hundreds rather than dozens. By 2012, there were thousands of cases across a large area of the southern and eastern U.S., and new cases are now popping up in several countries around the world. The culprit, the lone star tick, so-called because females have a white spot on their back, are famous for causing Masters’ disease, a disease similar to Lyme syndrome, also known as STARI (southern tick associated rash illness). But thanks to the lone star tick steadily expanding its range (even as far as Long Island, NY), it’s not necessarily just so Southern any more. What is the relevance of tick bites to the production of allergy-causing anti-meat antibodies to alpha-gal? Good question. What we know is that if you get bitten by one of these ticks, you can develop an allergy to meat (See Alpha Gal and the Lone Star Tick). This appears to be the first example of a response to an external parasite giving rise to an important form of food allergy. We don’t know the exact mechanism, but it may be because there’s something in the tick saliva that’s cross-reacting with alpha-gal, or because the tick is injecting you with animal allergens from its last meal. What role may these tick-bite induced allergies play in the development of chronic hives and other allergic skin reactions in children? See Tick Bites, Meat Allergies, and Chronic Urticaria.

A-157	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/20/what-do-eggs-do-to-our-arteries/	What Do Eggs Do To Our Arteries?	In reaction to the study that found a similar exponential increase in artery clogging plaque in both smokers and egg eaters, one critic countered that eggs have beneficial effects on vascular endothelium, the inner lining of our arteries, citing a 2005 study on egg consumption and endothelial function, funded by the American Egg Board (highlighted in my video, Eggs and Arterial Function). The study was done on a group of men and women eating the standard American diet, were overweight, had “normal” cholesterol, (which is to say extremely high cholesterol–LDL levels twice as high as could be considered optimal). As the authors of a paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology note, it’s often not appreciated “that the average blood cholesterol level in the United States, the so-called normal level, was actually too high,” accelerating heart disease and “putting a large fraction of the so-called normal population at a higher risk” for coronary heart disease, our number one killer. If we threw a lit match into a flaming pool of gasoline and saw no real difference in the height of the flames, we can’t conclude that throwing lit matches into gasoline is not a fire hazard. But that is exactly what the Egg Board study concluded. When the addition of eggs didn’t make the arterial function worse than it already was, they concluded that “short-term egg consumption does not adversely affect endothelial function in healthy adults.” The egg board paid for a follow-up study using folks who were even worse off, with a mean total cholesterol of 244. They reported that egg consumption had no effect on endothelial function… as compared to sausage and cheese. Yet instead of sounding the alarm that eating eggs is as bad for arterial function as a McDonald’s Sausage McMuffin (!), the researchers concluded that egg consumption was found to be non-detrimental to endothelial function and cholesterol levels. The subjects started out with life-threatening cholesterol, and ended up with life-threatening cholesterol. Why don’t endothelial function and cholesterol levels get even worse? Because there’s a plateau effect. We can basically max out on our cholesterol absorption. After a certain level of intake, it’s just another match to the fire. If we’re already consuming the standard American diet averaging 400mg of cholesterol daily, even adding two jumbo eggs to our diet may not have a sizeable impact. But to people trying to eat healthy, those two eggs could shoot their cholesterol up 20 points. However, a fat-free, cholesterol-free egg substitute was found to be beneficial. That is, not eating eggs lowers cholesterol levels and improves endothelial function—and that’s what these people needed. Their arteries were already hurting, they needed something to bring the fire down, not more matches. The subjects were apparently eating so unhealthily that adding eggs couldn’t make things much worse, but eating oatmeal instead of eggs made things better, helping to quench the fire. So even the Egg Board-funded studies said that not eating eggs is better for our arteries, yet these are the same studies that pro-egg folks cite to claim beneficial vascular effects. More on the reaction to the Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis study in my video, Debunking Egg Industry Myths, as well as further discussion of the effects of the cholesterol in eggs on the cholesterol levels in the blood of egg consumers. More on that in: I previously featured a food that actually does benefit vascular function. See Walnuts and Artery Function. Though the nut industry did try a similar tactic, see my video Nuts and Bolts of Cholesterol Lowering. The beef, soda, and dairy industries may also be guilty of experimental manipulation.

A-158	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/18/dietary-cholesterol-affects-blood-cholesterol-levels/	Dietary Cholesterol Affects Blood Cholesterol Levels	In my video, Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis, I profiled a study showing that both smoking and eating eggs can harm our arteries. But even egg yolks alone were associated with artery-clogging plaque buildup nearly two thirds as bad as smoking. This certainly ruffled some feathers. Yes, eggs are by far the number one source of cholesterol in the American diet, but some letters to the editor protested that dietary cholesterol may have very little impact on blood cholesterol levels, citing a study published in 1971 performed on eight people. But if one looks at dozens of studies together, covering hundreds of study subjects, we find that blood cholesterol concentration is “clearly increased by added dietary cholesterol.” In my video, Debunking Egg Industry Myths, there is an extreme example just to illustrate: a year in the life of a study subject taken on and off eggs. First, the researchers take him off eggs, putting him on a cholesterol-free diet, and his blood cholesterol plummets within just three weeks. Then they give him lots of eggs, and his cholesterol shoots back up, stays high until they take the eggs away and put him back on the cholesterol free diet, and so on and so forth. The researchers were essentially turning his high blood cholesterol on and off like a light switch (made out of eggs). Of course the only reason we care about our cholesterol levels or how much plaque is building up inside our arteries is because we want to avoid the consequences, like a heart attack. So do eggs increase our risk of cardiovascular disease? The latest meta-analysis, the latest compilation of all the best studies on egg consumption and risk of heart disease going back to 1930, found that, overall, those who ate the most eggs had a 19% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, a 68% increased risk of diabetes, and, once you have diabetes, an even greater 85% increased risk of heart disease. It didn’t take much; less than a single egg a day was associated with a significantly increased risk of heart disease. Just over half an egg a day may increase heart disease risk 6% (40% in separated diabetes patients), and the risk of diabetes by 29%. The researchers conclude that their findings support the American Heart Association dietary guidelines, which advise restricted egg consumption in adults for preventing cardiometabolic disease, like diabetes, our seventh leading cause of death, and heart disease, our number one killer. More on the diabetes connection in Eggs and Diabetes and Bacon, Eggs, and Gestational Diabetes During Pregnancy. More on eggs and the egg industry in general: There’s more to heart disease than just cholesterol buildup. In my video, Eggs and Arterial Function, I explore what effect egg consumption has on endothelial function, the ability of our arteries to relax normally. 	-	American Heart Association,animal products,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,cholesterol,diabetes,eggs,heart disease,heart health,industry influence,LDL cholesterol,lifespan,longevity,metabolic syndrome,mortality,nutrition myths,prediabetes,smoking,Standard American Diet	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/animal-protein/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/debunking-egg-industry-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23182841,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23643053,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bacon-eggs-and-gestational-diabetes-during-pregnancy-2/,http://www.jlr.org/content/12/2/233.short,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/debunking-egg-industry-myths/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-arterial-function/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22882905,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-159	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/13/how-walnuts-can-improve-artery-function/	Do Walnuts Really Improve Artery Function?	Good news for nut lovers: Eating at least one serving of walnuts per week may drop our chances of a cardiovascular-related death by 50%. However, walnut consumption may only drop our cholesterol levels about 5%. How could we get a 50% drop in cardiac mortality from just a 5% drop in cholesterol? Walnuts must have some other heart-protecting benefits besides lowering cholesterol. The ability of blood vessels to relax and open normally is considered an excellent barometer of underlying vascular health. For example, even after controlling for other risk factors, 80% of those with better than average arterial function survived cardiac event-free over the years, whereas 80% of those with below average dilation didn’t. So what effect do nuts have? A 2011 review in the journal Nutrition, Metabolism, and Cardiovascular Diseases found five clinical trials analyzing the effect of nut consumption on arterial function, and all three studies on walnuts showed an improvement in endothelial function measured in the arm. The study on pistachios also found a positive effect, but the study on hazelnuts was a wash. A subsequent study on hazelnuts, however, did find a significant improvement in arterial function, so the data for hazelnuts is mixed, whereas two subsequent walnut studies (highlighted in my video, Walnuts and Artery Function) confirmed walnuts’ benefits. Therefore, eight studies to date have investigated the effect of nuts on brachial artery function; seven out of eight showed a significant improvement in arterial function, one showed a negligible effect, and none found nuts made things worse. Half the studies, though, used the added nuts to replace foods in the diet known to have a negative effect on endothelial function. For example, in one study, walnuts replaced meat and dairy, which have been shown to be detrimental, so no wonder arterial function got better. When we do a study like that, we can’t tell if the benefits are because of the addition of the good stuff or the removal of the bad. In three of the other studies, nuts replaced olive oil, which tends to lead to a worsening of endothelial function. Therefore, in these four studies, the beneficial effects of the walnuts may have been exaggerated. However, the other four studies just added nuts as a snack or with a meal, without replacing any specific foods, and found that nuts significantly improved arterial functioning. Given their association with longevity (see Nuts May Help Prevent Death), I encourage everyone to eat an ounce of nuts a day (unless of course you’re allergic). Only about 1% of people report nut allergies, but still, that eliminates nut consumption for millions of Americans. What else can nuts do? See, for example: Don’t nuts make us fat, though? You may be surprised—see Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence. Which type of walnut is better?

A-160	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/08/11/salmon-may-be-the-greatest-source-of-dietary-pollutants/	Salmon May Be the Greatest Source of Dietary Pollutants	In my video Diabetes and Dioxins, I explored a nationwide study that found a strong dose-response relationship between industrial toxins and diabetes. Since then, Harvard researchers have reported a link between persistent pollutants like hexachlorobenzene and diabetes in their Nurse’s Health Study (See Food Sources of Perfluerochemicals). This is supported by an analysis they did of six other studies published since 2006 that showed the same thing. The Harvard researchers conclude that “past accumulation and continued exposure to these persistent pollutants may be a potent risk factor for developing diabetes.” Where is hexachlorobenzene found? In a U.S. supermarket survey, salmon and sardines were most heavily tainted with hexachlorobenzene, with salmon “the most contaminated food of all.” Farmed salmon specifically is perhaps the greatest source of dietary pollutants, averaging nearly ten times the PCB load of wild-caught salmon. Wait, isn’t there a flaw in this argument? Since many of these chemicals were banned in the 70’s, the levels inside people have been going down, whereas the rates of diabetes have been shooting straight up. Therefore, how could pollutant exposure be causing diabetes? This puzzle may be explained by our epidemic of obesity. The nationwide study found that the association between these toxins and diabetes was much stronger among obese subjects than among lean subjects. As people get fatter, the retention and toxicity of pollutants related to the risk of diabetes may increase. So we’re not just exposed by eating the fat of other animals; our own fat can be a continuous source of internal exposure because these persistent pollutants are slowly but continuously released from our fat stores into our circulation. They don’t call them “persistent pollutants” for nothing. These chemicals have such a long half-life that people consuming regular (even just monthly) meals of farmed salmon might end up retaining these chemicals in their bodies for 50 to 75 years. Hexachlorobenzene in fish has been tied to diabetes; what about the mercury? A 1995 study highlighted in my video, Pollutants in Salmon and Our Own Fat, out of Japan found that diabetics do seem to have higher mercury levels in their body. Mercury alone does not seem to increase diabetes risk, though. It may be the simultaneous exposure to both dioxins and mercury that increases risk, so the safety limits for dioxins and mercury individually may underestimate the risk when they’re consumed together in seafood. So while the pharmaceutical industry works on coming up with drugs to help mediate the impact of these pollutants, a better strategy might be to not get so polluted in the first place. Unfortunately, because we’ve so contaminated our world, we can’t escape exposure completely. You have to eat something. Some foods are more contaminated than others, though. Exposure to these pollutants comes primarily from the consumption of animal fat, with the highest levels found in fatty fish like salmon. Farmed Atlantic salmon may be the single largest source of these pollutants, and that’s the kind of salmon we most commonly find in supermarkets and restaurants. We hear about advisories warning pregnant women to avoid the consumption of food containing elevated levels of pollutants and mercury, but as a public health journal article points out, since these toxins bio-accumulate in the body for many years “restricting the exposure to these pollutants only during pregnancy would not protect the fetus or future generations against the harmful effects of these hazardous chemicals.” For the existing links between seafood and diabetes risk, see Fish and Diabetes and I explored this concept of our own body fat as a reservoir for disease-causing pollutants in Diabetes and Dioxins. More on hexachlorobenzene in my video Food Sources of Perfluorochemicals. Our body has a tougher time getting rid of some toxins than others: The best way to detox is to stop toxing in the first place. 	-	animal fat,biomagnification,diabetes,dioxins,fat,Harvard Nurses' Health Study,hexachlorobenzene,hypertension,industrial toxins,mercury,obesity,PCBs,persistent organic pollutants,prediabetes,pregnancy,restaurants,salmon,supermarkets	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/skin-health/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-and-dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22472455,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-salmon-and-our-own-fat/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7874464,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24026556,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16801591,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21087821,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23131992,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20146964,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22214250,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diabetes-and-dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22520265

Thanks to everyone who donated to the NutritionFacts.org Research Fund, we were able to test eight brands of nutritional yeast for the presence of the toxic heavy metal lead. The good news is that we couldn’t find any in most brands, but a few did have detectable levels. The lead contamination was so low that all brands complied with the exceedingly (and justifiably) strict California Prop 65 standards, but I do I advise pregnant women who eat more than a third of a cup a day on a regular basis choose one of the brands that tested free from detectable lead until we know more. Joseph includes details and direct links to all the testing reports in this morning’s blog post Three Brands of Nutritional Yeast Contain Detectable Lead Levels But the Risk is Minimal. What should we test next? Please post your suggestions to the Research Fund page. If you would like to participate in a research study yourself, you’re in luck!

A-162	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/30/three-brands-of-nutritional-yeast-contain-detectable-lead-levels-but-the-risk-is-minimal/	Three Brands of Nutritional Yeast Contain Detectable Lead Levels But the Risk is Minimal	Note from Dr. Greger: In short, we found detectable amounts of lead in samples of Frontier, KAL, and Whole Foods brand nutritional yeast, but the lead levels were so low that they all comply with the exceedingly (and justifiably) strict California Prop 65 standards. Still, I advise pregnant women who eat more than a third of a cup a day on a regular basis choose a different brand. No detectable lead levels were found in Bob’s Red Mill, Bragg, Dr. Fuhrman, Red Star, or NOW Foods brand nutritional yeast. Nutritional yeast has grown in popularity and is being introduced into many new dishes and recipes. It has a nice “cheesy” flavor and texture that can be used in sauces and soups or sprinkled over salads and popcorn. Dr. Greger recently covered how the beta glucan fiber in nutritional yeast can modulate our immune system and help to maintain our body’s defense against pathogens (See Dr. Greger’s video on Nutritional Yeast to Prevent the Common Cold). It seems beta glucans can be found in many foods, including mushrooms, which have been shown to boost immunity as well. A safety concern arose when Dr. Greger was notified that California’s prop 65 warning stickers were found on packages of nutritional yeast, suggesting there’s something in it exceeding cancer or reproductive safety limits. It turns out the problem was lead. There are many contaminants in the environment and in our food supply, even found in our children, which is probably why California has such strict guidelines on contamination. For example, California considers candies with lead levels in excess of 0.10 parts per million (ppm) to be excessively contaminated. State law requires products that contain more than half of a microgram of lead per daily serving to carry a label warning consumers. Could nutritional yeast carry lead levels this high? We reached out to some of the companies who produce nutritional yeast in hopes to better understand the situation. We asked if they perform lead testing and if they could share any information. The results of Dr. Greger’s inquiries can be found in his video here. He was frustrated by the lack of responsiveness and so decided we should take it upon ourselves to do our own testing. The NutritionFacts Research Fund was created and thanks to generous donor support we tested samples from 8 companies for the presence of lead in hopes to spur them to do their own testing. We hired an independent lab to conduct our tests for lead. I shipped out 8 samples of nutritional yeast in their original package. The lab used standard practices for lead testing known as Official Methods of Analysis set by AOAC International. Lab technicians determined the lead values based on California Prop 65 standards. Here are the results from the brands we tested: Bob’s Red Mill  – Test report shows no detectable lead (<0.01 ppm). Bragg – Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Dr. Fuhrman –  Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Frontier Coop – Test report shows lead levels at 0.021 ppm. It would take six tablespoons a day (based on the manufacture’s listed density) to exceed the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment Maximum Allowable Dose Level (MADL) for chemicals causing reproductive toxicity.* KAL – Test report shows lead levels at 0.011 ppm. It would take seven tablespoons a day to exceed the MADL.* NOW Foods – Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Red Star – Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm). Whole Foods – Test report shows lead levels at 0.012 ppm. It would take six tablespoons a day to exceed the MADL.* 	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-children-are-contaminated/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dioxins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/LeadFAQ.aspx,http://nutritionfacts.org/research-fund,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/	
A-163	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/28/dioxins-stored-in-our-own-fat-may-increase-diabetes-risk/	Dioxins Stored in Our Own Fat May Increase Diabetes Risk	Finding higher diabetes rates among those heavily exposed to toxic pollutants—such as those exposed to Agent Orange, chemical plant explosions, toxic waste dumps, or heavy metals in fish from the Great Lakes—is one thing. Would the same link be found in a random sampling of the general population? Yes. A strong dose-dependent relationship was found between the levels of these pollutants circulating in people’s blood and diabetes. Those with the highest levels of pollutants in their blood stream had 38 times the odds of diabetes. Interestingly, there was “no association between obesity and diabetes among subjects with non-detectable levels of pollutants.” In other words, “obesity was a risk factor for diabetes only if people had blood concentrations of these pollutants above a certain level.” We know obesity predisposes us to diabetes, but according to this study, highlighted in my video, Diabetes and Dioxins, this is perhaps true only if our bodies are contaminated with industrial pollutants. This finding implies that virtually all the risk of diabetes conferred by obesity is attributable to these pollutants, and that obesity might only be a vehicle for such chemicals. Could we be carrying around our own little toxic waste dump on our hips? Now it’s entirely possible that the six pollutants they looked at were not themselves causally related to diabetes. Rather, they could just be surrogates of exposure to a mixture of chemicals. After all, 90% of these pollutants in our diet come from animal foods. Except for individuals living or working around industrial sites where these chemicals were used or dumped, the most common source of exposure to PCBs is from diet, from foods of animal origin, especially seafood. The strong relationship the researchers found between certain pollutants and diabetes may just be pointing to other contaminants in animal products. If these pollutants are particularly found in seafood, are people who eat fish at higher risk for diabetes? See my videos Fish and Diabetes, and Pollutants in Salmon and Our Own Fat. For more on dioxins, see: For more on PCBs, see: These pollutants may also play a role in our rising epidemic of allergic diseases.

A-164	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/23/why-would-eating-fish-increase-diabetes-risk/	Why Would Eating Fish Increase Diabetes Risk?	In the past two years, six separate meta-analyses have been published on the relationship between fish consumption and type 2 diabetes. The whole point of a meta-analysis is to compile the best studies done to date and see what the overall balance of evidence shows. The fact that there are six different ones published recently highlights how open the question remains. One thread of consistency, though, was that fish consumers in the United States tended to be at greater risk for diabetes. If we include Europe, then fish eaters appeared to have a 38% increased risk of diabetes. On a per serving basis, that comes out to be about a 5% increase in risk for every serving of fish one has per week. To put that into perspective, a serving of red meat per day is associated with 19% increase in risk. Just one serving per day of fish would be equivalent to a 35% increase in risk. But why might fish be worse than red meat? Fish intake may increase type 2 diabetes risk by increasing blood sugar levels, as a review of the evidence commissioned by the U.S. government found. The review found that blood sugars increase in diabetics given fish oil. Another possible cause is that omega 3’s appear to cause oxidative stress. A recent study, highlighted in my video, Fish and Diabetes, found that the insulin producing cells in the pancreas don’t appear to work as well in people who eat two or more servings of fish a week. Or it may not be related to omega 3’s at all but rather the environmental contaminants that build up in fish. It all started with Agent Orange. We sprayed 20 million gallons of the stuff on Vietnam, and some of it was contaminated with trace amounts of dioxins. Though the Red Cross estimates that a million Vietnamese were adversely affected, what about all the servicemen who were exposed spraying it across the countryside? Reports started showing up that veterans exposed to Agent Orange appeared to have higher diabetes rates than unexposed veterans, a link that’s now officially recognized. These so-called “persistent organic pollutants” are mainly man-made industrial chemicals and are among the most hazardous compounds ever synthesized. They include dioxins, PCBs, and certain chlorine-containing pesticides, all of which are highly resistant to breakdown in the environment. Initially condemned for their deleterious effect on reproductive function and their ability to cause cancer, there is now a growing body of evidence showing that exposure to these pollutants leads to metabolic diseases such as diabetes. This is a breakthrough that “should require our greatest attention.” For more on the role industrial pollutants may play in our diabetes epidemic, see Diabetes and Dioxins and Pollutants in Salmon and Our Own Fat. More on the changing views surrounding fish oil supplements in Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil? Other foods associated with diabetes risk include processed meat and eggs.

A-165	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/21/why-deep-fried-foods-may-cause-cancer/	Why Deep Fried Foods May Cause Cancer	In the latest study on dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women, healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer, whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds. Included in the unhealthy eating pattern was the consumption of deep-fried foods, which have previously been linked to breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, oral and throat cancers, esophageal cancer, and cancer of the voicebox. No deep fried foods? What’s a Southern belle to do? Instead of deep fried foods, how about the traditional Southern diet, characterized by high intakes of cooked greens, beans, legumes, cabbage, sweet potatoes and cornbread, which may reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer significantly. What about the consumption of deep-fried foods and risk of prostate cancer? Researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington found that eating French fries, fried chicken, fried fish, and doughnuts was associated with about a third greater odds of prostate cancer. After stratifying for tumor aggressiveness, they found slightly stronger associations with more aggressive disease, suggesting that regular intake of deep-fried foods may contribute to the progression of prostate cancer as well. What in deep fried foods is so bad for us? Just heating oil that hot can generate potentially carcinogenic compounds, and then known carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form when the muscles of chickens and fish are cooked at that temperature. Deep-fried plants, on the other hand, can form acrylamide. I did a video about acrylamide back in 2008, suggesting it’s a probable human carcinogen (See Acrylamide in French Fries). Since then, studies have suggested pregnant women may want to cut back on French fries to protect the growth of their baby’s body and brain. Based on a study (highlighted in my video, Cancer Risk from French Fries) feeding people a little bag of potato chips every day for a month, it now seems acrylamide may also cause inflammation as well, which could explain its purported role in cancer progression. Acrylamide intake has been associated with endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer. How much cancer risk are we talking about? Taiwanese researchers examined lifetime cancer risk and French fry consumption. The researchers picked on French fries because they comprise by far the greatest percentage contribution of acrylamide to the diets of children. They estimated that, at most, one or two boys and girls out of every ten thousand would develop cancer eating French fries that they would otherwise not have developed if they hadn’t eaten French fries. So it’s not as bad as eating something like fried fish, or fried chicken, but how much is that saying? The level of cancer risk in both boys and girls associated with French fries depends on how long and hot they’re fried. In Europe, the food industry swore that they’d self-regulate and control fry times to decrease acrylamide levels, but we’ve yet to see any subsequent change in acrylamide levels in French fries. Researchers continue to urge that the cooking temperature should be as low as possible and the cooking time should be as short as possible, “while still maintaining a tasty quality” of course. We wouldn’t want to reduce cancer risk too much—they might not taste as good! Blanching the potatoes first reduces acrylamide formation, but potato chip companies complain that, not only would it muck with the flavor, but it would reduce the nutritional properties by leaching away some of the vitamin C.

A-166	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/16/do-cholesterol-statin-drugs-cause-breast-cancer/	Do Cholesterol Statin Drugs Cause Breast Cancer?	What does breast cancer have to do with cholesterol? There are many potential mechanisms by which cholesterol boosts breast cancer growth. For example, our bodies make estrogen, which is correlated with an increased risk of breast cancer, out of cholesterol. We also package cholesterol into LDL, which, as you can see in my video Cholesterol Feeds Breast Cancer Cells, appeared to increase cancer proliferation and decrease patient survival. Cholesterol is a major component of “lipid rafts.” Compared to their normal counterparts, cancer cells have higher levels of these cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in their plasma membrane, which may be important for cancer cell survival and may serve in human cancer development in terms of tumor migration and invasion. Elevated levels of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts have been found in breast cancer cells, and the hypothesis is that reducing blood cholesterol levels “may disrupt lipid raft formation and thereby inhibit breast cancer development.” This suggests cholesterol targeting may be used as a cancer therapy. Controlled laboratory experiments have shown that phytosterols in seeds and nuts at dietary relevant levels appear to inhibit the growth of several types of tumor cells including breast cancer cells, including both estrogen-receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive cancer. The therapeutic implications are that “plant-based diets rich in phytosterols may offer protection against the development of breast cancer.” Of course, you can’t make a lot of money on pumpkin seeds, so researchers looked to cholesterol-lowering statin drugs (this study is highlighted in my video, Statin Cholesterol Drugs and Invasive Breast Cancer). Some petri dish work looked promising, but population studies have shown mixed results. Some studies showed that women on statins had decreased breast cancer risk, some showed increased risk, and most showed no association. These were all relatively short-term studies, though. “Long-term” statin use was defined as mostly just three to five years, but breast cancer can take decades to grow. The one study that looked at ten or more years of statin use only included 62 cases. Given the increase in statin use over the past few decades, and the fact that they’re commonly prescribed to be taken every day for the rest of women’s lives, the studies published to date only had limited ability to evaluate the impact of long durations of use. We better figure this out: about one in four women over 45 in this country are on these drugs. But that all changed with the publication of a study in 2013 including thousands of breast cancer cases. Long term statin users—women taking statins for ten years or more—had more than double the risk of both major types of breast cancer: invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. Once women do get breast cancer, though, recent studies in Finland and the UK suggest statin use may improve survival. The number one killer of women is heart disease, not breast cancer, so we still do need to bring down cholesterol levels. Might there be a way to get the benefits of cholesterol reduction without the risks? Plant-based diets have been shown to lower LDL-cholesterol by over 30%, within just a couple weeks, equivalent to most of the standard cholesterol lowering statin drugs and without any breast cancer risk. As drugs go, statins are remarkably safe, but they can still present rare but serious side effects in both men and women (Statin Muscle Toxicity). How can we lower cholesterol without drugs? It’s Purely a Question of Diet. We can lower our cholesterol by lowering our intake of three things: Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. Where are trans fats found? Trans Fat in Meat and Dairy. Where is cholesterol found? Predominantly eggs: Eggs and Cholesterol: Patently False and Misleading Claims.

A-167	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/14/breast-cancer-cells-feed-on-cholesterol/	Breast Cancer Cells Feed on Cholesterol	One in eight American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. There are a number of compounds in plant foods that may protect against breast cancer by a variety of mechanisms. I’ve talked about the benefits of broccoli, flaxseeds, and soy foods before (See Breast Cancer Survival Vegetable,  Flaxseeds & Breast Cancer Prevention, and Breast Cancer Survival and Soy) but a recent German study reported something new. The researchers found that sunflower and pumpkin seeds were associated with reduced breast cancer risk. They initially chalked the association up to the lignans in the seeds (See Breast Cancer Survival and Lignan Intake), but their lignan lead didn’t pan out. Maybe it’s the phytosterols found concentrated in seeds? (See Optimal Phytosterol Source). There is evidence that phytosterols may be anticancer nutrients and play a role in reducing breast cancer risk. I thought phytosterols just lowered cholesterol? (See How Phytosterols Lower Cholesterol) What does cancer have to do with cholesterol? Increasing evidence demonstrates the role that cholesterol may play in the development and progression of breast cancer. Cancer feeds on cholesterol. Transformed cells take up LDL, so-called “bad” cholesterol, and it’s capable of stimulating the growth of human breast cancer cells in a petri dish. The ability to accumulate fat and cholesterol may enable cancer cells to take advantage of people eating high fat and high cholesterol diets and at least partially explain the benefit of a low-fat diet on lowering human breast cancer recurrence. Although the data has been mixed, the largest study to date (highlighted in my video, Cholesterol Feeds Breast Cancer Cells) found a 17% increased breast cancer risk in women who had a total cholesterol over 240 compared to women whose cholesterol was under 160. However, the researchers could not rule out that there may be something else in cholesterol-raising foods that’s increasing breast cancer risk. Tumors suck up so much cholesterol that LDL has been considered a vehicle for delivering antitumor drugs to cancer cells. Since cancer feeds on cholesterol, maybe we could stuff some chemo into it like a Trojan horse poison pill? The uptake of LDL into tumors may be why people’s cholesterol levels drop low after they get cancer—the tumor is eating it up. In fact, patient survival may be lowest when cholesterol uptake is highest. “High LDL receptor content in breast cancer tissue seems to indicate a poor prognosis, [suggesting] that breast tumors rich in LDL receptors may grow rapidly [in the body].” We’ve known about this for decades. You can tell that was an old study because, when it was published in the ‘80s, only 1 in 11 American women got breast cancer. If cholesterol increases breast cancer risk, what about the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs? See Statin Cholesterol Drugs and Invasive Breast Cancer.

A-168	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/09/using-diet-to-treat-asthma-and-eczema/	Using Diet to Treat Asthma and Eczema	I previously discussed the power of fruits and vegetables to help prevent and treat asthma and allergies. If adding a few more servings of fruits and vegetables may help asthma, what about a diet centered around plants? Twenty patients with allergic eczema were placed on a vegetarian diet.  At the end of two months, their disease scores, which covered both subjective and objective signs and symptoms, were cut in half, similar to what we might see using one of our most powerful drugs. The drug works much quicker, within about two weeks, but since drugs can often include dangerous side effects the dietary option is more attractive. This was no ordinary vegetarian diet, however. This was an in-patient study using an extremely calorically-restricted diet—the subjects were practically half fasting. Therefore, we don’t know which component was responsible for the therapeutic effect. What about using a more conventional plant-based diet against a different allergic disease, asthma? In Sweden, there was an active health movement that claimed that a vegan diet could improve or cure asthma. This was a bold claim, so in order to test this, a group of orthopedic surgeons at Linköping University Hospital followed a series of patients who were treated with a vegan regimen for one year. (This study is highlighted in my video, Treating Asthma and Eczema with Plant-Based Diets.) Participants had to be willing to go completely plant-based, and they had to have physician-verified asthma of at least a year’s duration that wasn’t getting better or was getting worse despite the best medical therapies available. The researchers found quite a sick group to follow. The thirty-five patients had long-established, hospital-verified bronchial asthma for an average duration of a dozen years. Of the 35 patients, 20 had been admitted to the hospital for acute asthmatic attacks during the last two years. Of these, one patient had received acute infusion therapy (emergency IV drugs) a total of 23 times during this period and another patient claimed he had been to the hospital 100 times during his disease and on every occasion had evidently required such treatments. One patient even had a cardiac arrest during an asthma attack and had been brought back to life on a ventilator. These were some pretty serious cases. The patients were on up to eight different asthma medicines when they started, with an average of four and a half drugs, and were still not getting better. Twenty of the 35 were constantly using cortisone, which is a powerful steroid used in serious cases. These were all fairly advanced cases of the disease, more severe than the vegan practitioners were used to. Eleven couldn’t stick to the diet for a year, but of the 24 that did, 71% reported improvement at four months and 92% at one year. These were folks that had not improved at all over the previous year. Concurrently with this improvement, the patients greatly reduced their consumption of medicine. Four had completely given up their medication altogether, and only two weren’t able to at least drop their dose. They went from an average of 4.5 drugs down to 1.2, and some were able to get off cortisone. Some subjects said that their improvement was so considerable they felt like “they had a new life.” One nurse had difficulty at work because most of her co-workers were smokers, but after the plant-based regimen she could withstand the secondhand smoke without getting an attack and could tolerate other asthma triggers. Others reported the same thing. Whereas previously they could only live in a clean environment and felt more or less isolated in their homes, they could now go out without getting asthmatic attacks. The researchers didn’t find only subjective improvements. They also found a significant improvement in a number of clinical variables, most importantly in measures of lung function, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and physical working capacity, as well as significant drops in sed rate (a marker of inflammation) and IgE (allergy associated antibodies). The study started out with 35 patients who had suffered from serious asthma for an average of 12 years, all receiving long-term medication, with 20 using cortisone, who were “subjected to vegan food for a year,” and, in almost all cases, medication was withdrawn or reduced, and asthma symptoms were significantly reduced. Despite the improved lung function tests and lab values, the placebo effect can’t be discounted since there was no blinded control group. However, the nice thing about a healthy diet is that there are only good side effects. The subjects’ cholesterol significantly improved, their blood pressures got better, and they lost 18 pounds. From a medical standpoint, I say why not give it a try?

A-169	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/07/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-pills/	Treating Asthma With Plants vs. Pills	In my video Treating Asthma With Fruits and Vegetables, I highlighted a landmark study on manipulating antioxidant intake in asthma. The study found that just a few extra fruits and vegetables a day can powerfully reduce asthma exacerbation rates. If the antioxidants in the plants are ameliorating asthma, then why can’t we take antioxidant pills instead? Because antioxidant pills don’t appear to work. Studies using antioxidant supplements on respiratory or allergic diseases have mostly shown no beneficial effects. This discrepancy between data relating to fruit and vegetable intake compared with those using antioxidant supplements may indicate the importance of the whole food, rather than individual components. For example, in the Harvard Nurse’s Health Study, women who got the most vitamin E from their diet appeared to be at half the risk for asthma, (which may help explain why nut consumption is associated with significantly lower rates of wheezing), but vitamin E supplements did not appear to help. Men who eat a lot of apples appear to have superior lung function, as do kids who eat fresh fruit every day, as measured by FEV1 (basically how much air you can forcibly blow out in one second). The more fruit, salad, and green vegetables kids ate, the greater their lung function appeared. Researchers are “cautious about concluding which nutrient might be responsible.” There’s vitamin C in fruits, salads, and green vegetables, but there are lots of other antioxidants, such as “vitamin P,” a term used to describe polyphenol phytonutrients found in grapes, flax seeds, beans, berries, broccoli, apples, citrus, herbs, tea, and soy. Polyphenol phytonutrients can directly bind to allergenic proteins and render them hypoallergenic, allowing them to slip under our body’s radar. If this first line of defense fails, polyphenols can also inhibit the activation of the allergic response and prevent the ensuing inflammation, and so may not only work for prevention, but for treatment as well. Most of the available evidence is weak, though, in terms of using supplements containing isolated phytonutrients to treat allergic diseases. We could just give people fruits and vegetables to eat, but then we couldn’t perform a double-blind study to see if they work better than placebo. Some researchers decided to use pills containing plant food extracts. Plant extracts are kind of a middle ground. They are better than isolated plant chemicals, but are not as complete as whole foods. Still, since we can’t put whole foods in a capsule, we can compare the extracts to fake sugar pills that look and feel the same to see if they have an effect. The first trial involved giving people extracts of apple skins. I’ve talked about the Japan’s big cedar allergy problem before (See Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies), so apple extract pills were given every day for a few months starting right before pollen season started. The results were pretty disappointing. They found maybe a little less sneezing, but the extract didn’t seem to help their stuffy noses or itchy eyes. What about a tomato extract? A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled eight-week trial was performed on perennial allergic rhinitis, this time not for seasonal pollen, but for year-round allergies to things like dust-mites. There are lots of drugs out there, but you may have to take them every day year-round, so how about some tomato pills instead? After oral administration of tomato extract for eight weeks, there was a significant improvement of total nasal symptom scores, combined sneezing, runny nose and nasal obstruction, with no apparent adverse effects. Would whole tomatoes work even better? If only researchers would design an experiment directly comparing phytonutrient supplements to actual fruits and vegetables head-to-head against asthma, but such a study had never been done… until now. The same amazing study, highlighted in my video, Treating Asthma with Plants vs. Supplements?, that compared the seven-fruit-and-vegetables-a-day diet to the three-fruit-and-vegetables-a-day diet, after completion of its first phase, commenced a parallel, randomized, controlled supplementation trial with capsules of tomato extract, which boosted the power of five tomatoes in one little pill, and the study subjects were given three pills a day. Who did better, the group that ate seven servings of actual fruits and vegetables a day, or the group that ate three servings a day but also took 15 supposed serving equivalents in pill form? The pills didn’t help at all. Improvements in lung function and asthma control were evident only after increased fruit and vegetable intake, which suggests that whole-food interventions are most effective. Both the supplements and increased fruit and vegetable intake were effective methods for increasing carotenoid concentrations in the bloodstream, but who cares? Clinical improvements—getting better from disease—were evident only as a result of an increase in plant, not pill, consumption. The results provide further evidence that whole-food approaches should be used to achieve maximum efficacy of antioxidant interventions. And if this is what a few more plants can do, what might a whole diet composed of plants accomplish? See Treating Asthma and Eczema with Plant-Based Diets. I also dealt with preventing asthma in the first place: Preventing Asthma With Fruits and Vegetables. The theme of whole foods being more efficacious than supplements seems to come up over and over again. See for example: More on “vitamin P” in How to Slow Brain Aging by Two Years.

A-170	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/07/02/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-treat-asthma/	How Fruits and Vegetables Can Treat Asthma	In my video Preventing Asthma With Fruits and Vegetables, I highlighted an international study of asthma and allergies involving more than a million kids. The study found a consistent inverse relationship between prevalence rates of asthma, allergies, and eczema and the intake of plants, starch, grains, and vegetables. Researchers speculated “over a decade ago that if these findings could be generalized, and if the average daily consumption of these foods increased, an important decrease in symptom prevalence could be achieved.” No need to speculate any more, though, because plants were finally put to the test. Researchers have proposed that “by eating fewer fruits and vegetables, the susceptibility to potentially harmful inhaled substances of the population as a whole may be increased because of the reduction in antioxidant defenses of the lungs.” The thin lining of fluid that forms the interface between our respiratory tract and the external environment is our first line of defense against oxidative damage. Oxidative damage is important in asthma, contributing to airway contraction, excessive mucous production, and hypersensitivity. Antioxidants protect against oxidative stress, so our lung lining contains a range of antioxidants our body makes itself, as well as those obtained from our diet, particularly from fruits and vegetables. We can even quantify the level of oxidative stress in people by measuring the level of oxidation products in their exhaled breath, which drops as we start eating more fruits and vegetables, and drops further as we combine more plants with fewer animal foods. Do those with asthma really have lower levels of antioxidants than people without asthma? Compared to healthy controls, subjects with asthma had lower whole blood levels of total carotenoids and lower levels of each of the individual phytonutrients they measured: cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene compared to healthy controls. Therefore, they posit, “the accumulating evidence does suggest that diet has an influence in modulating the response of the lung to inhaled allergens and irritants. However, it is possible that the reduced carotenoid levels in asthma are a result of increased utilization in the presence of excess free radicals.” So it’s like a chicken-or-the-egg phenomenon. We know antioxidant-rich diets have been associated with reduced asthma prevalence. However, direct evidence that altering intake of antioxidant-rich foods actually affects asthma was lacking, until now. There are two ways to test the effects of fruits and vegetables on asthma. Add fruits and vegetables to people’s diets and see if their asthma improves, or take asthmatics and remove fruits and vegetables from their diets and see if they get worse. The first such study of its kind, highlighted in my video, Treating Asthma With Fruits and Vegetables, placed subjects with asthma on a low antioxidant diet. After just a matter of days, there was a significant worsening of lung function and asthma control. The researchers conclude that, “This finding is highly significant for subjects with asthma, as it indicates that omitting antioxidant-rich foods from the diet, for even a short time frame, will have a detrimental effect on asthma symptoms.” Ironically, the low antioxidant diet consumed by subjects, where they were restricted to one serving of fruit and up to two servings of vegetables per day, is typical of Western diets. In other words, the low antioxidant diet they used to worsen people’s asthma, crippling their lung function, was just like the standard American diet. As about “half the population usually consumes a diet with an intake of fruit and vegetables equivalent to that in the study diet or less, it appears likely that this dietary pattern, which must be considered suboptimal for lung health, may have a significant impact on asthma management, indicating the potential for typical Western dietary patterns to contribute to a worsening of lung function and asthma control.” Within just days, cutting down fruit and vegetable intake can impair lung function, but does adding fruits and vegetables help with asthma? That was the second phase of the study. Asthmatics on the standard American diet had about a 40% chance of relapsing into an asthma exacerbation within three months. However, put them on seven servings of fruits and vegetables a day instead of three, and we cut their exacerbation rate in half, down to 20%. Imagine if there were a drug that could work as powerfully as a few fruits and vegetables. If manipulating antioxidant intake by increasing fruit and vegetable intake can so powerfully reduce asthma exacerbation rates, why not just take antioxidant pills instead? I cover that in my video Treating Asthma With Plants vs. Supplements? And if a few extra servings of fruits and vegetables can make that kind of difference, what about a whole diet composed of plants? Check out Treating Asthma and Eczema With Plant-Based Diets.

A-171	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/30/how-fruits-and-vegetables-can-prevent-asthma/	How Fruits and Vegetables Can Prevent Asthma	Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and the prevalence is increasing around the world. Despite this, most research dollars are spent on adult chronic disease. “One might ask,” a group of researchers posited “whether this is because our politicians and senior administrators feel themselves to be more likely to suffer from the latter, and thus ignore allergic diseases as they mostly impact children and young adults” – who don’t vote. An enormous study about asthma and allergies in childhood, highlighted in my video, Preventing Asthma with Fruits and Vegetables, was published that includes more than a million children in nearly a hundred countries, making it the most comprehensive survey of asthma and allergies ever undertaken. The researchers found striking worldwide variations in the prevalence and severity of asthma, allergies, and eczema—a 20 to 60-fold difference in prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic runny nose, and atopic eczema around the world. The large variability suggests a crucial role of local characteristics that are determining the differences in prevalence between one place and another. What kind of environmental factors? Why does the prevalence of itchy eyes and runny noses range anywhere from 1% in India, for example, and up to 45% of kids elsewhere? There were some associations with regional air pollution and smoking rates, but the most significant associations were with diet. Adolescents showed a consistent pattern of decreases in symptoms of wheeze (current and severe), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema with increases in per capita consumption of plant foods. The more their calories and protein came from plant sources, the less allergies they tended to have. In general, there seems to be an association between an increase in asthma prevalence and a decrease in consumption of fresh fruits, green vegetables, and other dietary sources of antioxidants, helping to explain why the prevalence of asthma and respiratory symptoms is lower in populations with high intake of foods of plant origin. High intakes of fat and sodium, and low intakes of fiber and carbohydrates, are linked with asthma, while traditional and vegetarian diets are associated with lower rates. For example, if we look closer within India, in a study of more than 100,000 people, “those who consumed meat (daily or occasionally) were more likely to report asthma than those who were strictly vegetarian.” This also meant avoiding eggs. Eggs have been associated (along with soft drink consumption) with increased risk of respiratory symptoms and asthma in schoolchildren. On the other hand, consumptions of soy foods and fruits were associated with reduced risk of respiratory symptoms. In fact, removing eggs and dairy from the diet may improve lung function in asthmatic children in as little as eight weeks. Therefore, it may be a combination of eating fewer animal foods and more plants. High vegetable intake, for example, has been found protective in children, potentially cutting the odds of allergic asthma in half. And fruit has also shown a consistent protective association for current and severe wheeze and runny nose in adolescents, and for current and severe asthma, allergies, and eczema in children. Why is this? I’ve talked about the endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants (see Dietary Sources of Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors) building up in the meat supply that may increase the risk of allergic disease, but the increase in asthma may be a combination of both a more toxic environment and a more susceptible population. One review notes that, “The dietary changes which have occurred over recent years may have led to a reduction in these natural antioxidant defenses, resulting in a shift of the antioxidant status of the whole population and leading to increased susceptibility to oxidant attack and airway inflammation.” In adults, for example, the risk of airway hyper-reactivity may increase seven-fold among those with the lowest intake of vitamin C from plant foods, while those with the lowest intake of saturated fats may have a 10-fold protection, presumably because of saturated fat’s role in triggering inflammation. The protective effect of plant-based food may also be mediated through effects on intestinal microflora. It turns out that differences in the indigenous intestinal flora might affect the development and priming of the immune system in early childhood. Kids with allergies, for example, tend to be less likely to harbor lactobacilli, the good bacteria that’s found in fermented foods, and naturally on many fruits and vegetables. Lactobacillus probiotics may actually help with childhood asthma, which may help explain why children raised on largely organic vegetarian diets may have a lower prevalence of allergic reactions. Infants raised this way tend to have more good lactobacilli in their guts compared to controls, though they were also more likely to have been born naturally, breastfed longer, and not been given antibiotics, so we can’t really tell if it’s the diet until we put it to the test (See Treating Asthma with Fruits and Vegetables). More on preventing allergic diseases can be found in my videos Preventing Childhood Allergies and Preventing Allergies in Adulthood. More on protecting lung function with fruits and vegetables can be found in Preventing COPD With Diet. Surprised probiotics can affect immune function? Check out my video Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics? And if you think that is wild, wait until you see Gut Feelings: Probiotics and Mental Health. What might be in plants that’s so beneficial? See Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants. What might be in animal products that is harmful to lung function? There are endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants that build up in the food chain that may be playing a role. See my video Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies. Also there’s an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs that may contribute to inflammation as well. See Inflammatory Remarks About Arachidonic Acid. Choosing fragrance-free personal care products may also help reduce airway reactivity: Throw Household Products Off the Scent.  I compare the efficacy of plants to pills (Treating Asthma With Plants vs. Supplements?) and explore the role an entire diet filled with plants might play in Treating Asthma and Eczema With Plant-Based Diets. 	-	air pollution,allergies,animal protein,antibiotics,antioxidants,asthma,biomagnification,breastfeeding,calories,children,chronic diseases,dairy,eczema,eggs,elderly,endocrine disruptors,fermented foods,fruit,immune function,India,industrial toxins,inflammation,lung disease,lung health,meat,organic foods,oxidative stress,persistent organic pollutants,plant protein,plant-based diets,probiotics,protein,respiratory infections,saturated fat,smoking,soda,soy,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,vitamin C	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/citrus/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/throw-household-products-off-the-scent/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17943568,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10451693,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22628152,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-and-eczema-with-plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23317966,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-fruits-and-vegetables/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12485315,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/throw-household-products-off-the-scent/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20092649,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-asthma-with-plants-vs-supplements,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-childhood-allergies/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22771150,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15067979,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11048770,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8128408,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22885561,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15007630,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-sources-of-alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10833469	
A-172	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/25/our-tax-dollars-subsidize-unhealthy-foods/	Our Tax Dollars Subsidize Unhealthy Foods	Why do food companies sell junk? Because unhealthy commodities are highly profitable. This is in part because of their “low production cost, long shelf-life, and high retail value,” which create perverse incentives for industries to market and sell more junk. In a study highlighted in my video, Taxpayer Subsidies for Unhealthy Foods, researchers at the University of Cambridge stated, “Coca-Cola’s net profit margins, for example, are about a quarter of the retail price, making soft drink production, alongside tobacco production, among the most profitable industrial activities in the world.” One of the reasons production costs are so low is that we tax-payers subsidize them. Distinguished UNC Professor of Nutrition, Barry Popkin, writes: “For more than a century, Western governments have invested heavily in lowering the costs of animal products and some basic cash crops [such as sugar]. Accordingly, Western diets have shifted during the past century, especially after World War II, to include more animal sourced foods—meat, poultry, dairy, seafood, and eggs [as well as more sugar and corn syrup]. During this same period, however, we have begun to realize that a healthy diet actually requires fewer animal products and empty calories, and more vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains. Redressing this balance is a complex task requiring not only a shift in agricultural investment and policy, but also changes in social preferences that have developed over decades, in part due to dollar menu meat.” Why is chicken so cheap? In the nine years that followed the passage of the ‘96 Farm Bill, corn and soy were subsidized below the cost of production to make cheap animal feed. So, U.S. tax-payers effectively handed the chicken and pork industry around $10 billion dollars each. What if we instead subsidized healthy foods? Or taxed harmful ones? Every dollar spent taxing processed foods or milk would net an estimated $2 in healthcare cost savings. Every dollar spent making vegetables cheaper would net $3, and subsidizing whole grains could net over a one thousand percent return on our investment. Unfortunately, we can’t count on Big Broccoli. The produce sector lacks the extensive funding that went to create the National Dairy Council, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the National Pork Producers Council, and the American Egg Board. Even if we removed the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual subsidies for animal products, it might not be sufficient to tip the balance in favor of healthier diets. According to Professor Popkin, “We have created societies in the West that value and consume meat, dairy, poultry, fish and seafood. Over several generations, a particular way of life has been promoted that has shifted expectations about diet to include large amounts of animal-sourced foods”—the concept that a meal centers around some hunk of meat. The idea that animal products should form the basis of our diet has been scientifically debunked, but remains the social aspiration of billions of people. As we in the West slowly come to accept that our diets and eating habits are not healthy, it is to be hoped that this will change policies not only here, but throughout the world. For more on the power Big Food’s hold over our political system, check out videos such as: My video series on corporate influence over our federal nutrition guidelines may also be enlightening: And if we really wanted to save our country money we could start by trying to wipe out some of our leading killer chronic diseases: 	-	American Egg Board,animal products,beans,chicken,Coca Cola,corn,corn syrup,cost savings,dairy eggs,empty calories,factory farming practices,Farm Bill,farmers,feed additives,fish,fruit,grains,industry influence,marketing,meat,Medicare,milk,National Cattlemen's Beef Association,National Dairy Council,National Pork Producers Council,pork,poultry,seafood,soda,soy,Standard American Diet,subsidies,sugar,tobacco,turkey,vegetables	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/taxpayer-subsidies-for-unhealthy-foods/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22745605,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22365570,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21151043,http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/rp/CompanyFeedSvgsFeb07.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-173	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/23/reducing-arsenic-in-chicken-and-rice/	Reducing Arsenic in Chicken and Rice	In 2013, Maryland became the first state to ban the feeding of an arsenic-containing drug to chickens. This arsenic-containing drug is used to control parasites and gives chicken meat an “appealing pink color.” In 2011, the FDA found that the livers of chickens fed this drug had elevated levels of inorganic arsenic, a known human carcinogen. In response, the drug’s manufacturer, Pfizer, voluntarily pulled the drug off the U.S. market. However, it’s still sold overseas—including to places that continue to export chicken back to us—and a similar arsenic-containing drug for use in poultry is still available in the United States. The Maryland ban was still some help, though; it kept Maryland farmers from using stockpiles of the drug. How much arsenic gets into the actual meat and not just the internal organs? We didn’t know until recently. In a study highlighted in my video, How Many Cancers Caused by Arsenic-Laced Chicken?, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health coordinated the purchase of chicken breasts off grocery store shelves in ten cities across the country. They found that 70% of the samples of chicken meat from poultry producers that didn’t prohibit arsenic drugs were contaminated with the cancer-causing form of arsenic at levels that exceeded the safety thresholds originally set by the FDA (before the FDA relented and admitted that there’s really no safe level of this kind of arsenic). When the drug was first approved, scientists believed that its organic arsenic base would be excreted unchanged (organic arsenic is much less dangerous than inorganic arsenic). Guess what appears to convert the drug into the carcinogenic form? Cooking. When chicken meat is cooked, levels of the arsenic-containing drug go down and levels of carcinogenic arsenic go up, suggesting the drug may degrade into the cancer-causing inorganic arsenic form during cooking. How much cancer are we talking about? If we estimate that about three-quarters of Americans eat chicken, then the arsenic in that chicken has potentially been causing more than 100 cases of cancer every year. The John Hopkins researchers conclude that “eliminating the use of arsenic-based drugs in [poultry and pig] production could reduce the burden of arsenic-related disease in the U.S. population.” Arsenic-containing drugs fed to chickens is one of the ways arsenic gets into rice. When we feed arsenic to chickens, the resulting arsenic-bearing poultry manure is introduced to the environment, soil, and water, and rice sucks it up from contaminated soil and can transfer it to people who don’t even eat chicken. There is massive environmental contamination from the poultry industry; nearly two million pounds of arsenic has been poured into the environment every year by the U.S chicken industry alone. We’re even seeing arsenic in foods sweetened with organic brown rice syrup. It reminds me of the arsenic in apple juice story. Although the U.S. made lead and arsenic-based pesticides illegal years ago, they still persist in the soil, so even organic products are not immune. There are other sources of arsenic (such as naturally occurring arsenic deposits), but arsenic-containing poultry drugs have been deliberately administered to animals intended for human consumption for 70 years. Consequently, exposures resulting from use of these drugs are far more controllable than are exposures from environmental sources. And the good news is that, thanks to a lawsuit from the Center for Food Safety and other consumer groups, three out of the four arsenic-containing drugs fed to poultry have been officially pulled from the market. I’ve previously addressed this issue in my video Arsenic in Chicken. It’s nice to see there’s been some progress! The antibiotics the poultry industry continues to feed chickens present another public health hazard.

A-174	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/18/how-contaminated-are-our-children/	How Contaminated Are Our Children?	In a study highlighted in my video, California Childen Are Contaminated, researchers analyzed the diets of California children ages two through seven to determine the cancer and non-cancer health effects from food contaminant exposures. It turns out food may be the primary route of exposure to toxic heavy metals, persistent pollutants, and pesticides. “Though food-borne toxic contaminants are a concern for all ages, they are of greatest concern for children, who are disproportionately impacted because they’re still developing and have greater intake of food and fluids relative to their weight. Pediatric problems that have been linked to preventable environmental toxin exposures include cancer, asthma, lead poisoning, neurobehavioral disorders, learning and developmental disabilities, and birth defects.” The good news is that changing one’s diet can change one’s exposure. Quoting from the study, “A diet high in fish and animal products, for example, results in greater exposure to persistent pollutants like DDT and dioxins and heavy metals than does a plant-based diet because these compounds bioaccumulate up the food chain.” Plants are at the bottom of the food chain. The sample of California kids, however, was not eating a plant-based diet. Cancer benchmark levels were exceeded by all 364 children for arsenic, the banned pesticide dieldrin, a metabolite of DDT called DDE, and dioxins. Children exceeded safety levels by a greater margin than adults. This is especially of concern for children because all of these compounds are suspected endocrine disruptors and thus may impact normal development. Cancer risk ratios were exceeded by over a factor of 100 for both arsenic and dioxins. Which foods were the worst? For preschoolers, the number one food source of arsenic was poultry, though for their parents, it was tuna. The number one source of lead was dairy, and for mercury it was seafood. And the number one source of the banned pesticides and dioxins was dairy. (See Preventing Parkinson’s Disease With Diet.) The researchers also recommended children should eat lower quantities of chips, cereal, crackers, and other crispy carbs to reduce acrylamide intake.  The California study didn’t split up the groups by gender, but a similar study in Europe found that men had higher levels of some of these pollutants than women. For example, levels of the banned pesticide chlordane were higher in men, but women who never breastfed were right up there alongside men, with the lowest levels found in women who breastfed over 12 months. Therefore, it is likely that the lactation-related reduction in blood pollutant levels partly explains the lower body burdens among women compared with men. So cows can lower their levels by giving some to us, then we can pass it along to our children. What non-cancer effects might some of these pollutants have? They can affect our immune system. Studies clearly demonstrate the “ability of dioxins and related compounds to have a long-lasting and deleterious impact on immune function.” This manifests as increased incidences of respiratory infections, ear infections, cough, and sore throat. At first, most of the data was for during infancy, but now we have follow-up studies showing that the immunosuppressive effects of these toxins may persist into early childhood, so we should try to reduce our exposure as much as possible. Because these pollutants accumulate in animal fat, consuming a plant-based diet–decreasing meat, dairy, and fish consumption–may reduce exposure for children and adults alike. These findings should come as no surprise to those who saw my video Pollutants in California Breast Tissue. For an overview see CDC Report on Environmental Chemical Exposure and President’s Cancer Panel Report on Environmental Risk. Pollutant exposure may affect the ability to have children in the first place (Male Fertility and Diet and Meat Hormones & Female Infertility). Such a delay, though, may allow one an opportunity to reduce one’s toxic burden through dietary change (Hair Testing for Mercury Before Considering Pregnancy and How Long to Detox From Fish Before Pregnancy?). During pregnancy, pollutants can be transferred directly (DDT in Umbilical Cord Blood), and after pregnancy through breastfeeding (The Wrong Way to Detox). Once our kids are contaminated, How Fast Can Children Detoxify from PCBs? The chemicals have implications for older children too: Protein, Puberty, and Pollutants. Seafood is not the only source of toxic heavy metals.

A-175	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/16/living-longer-by-reducing-leucine-intake/	Living Longer by Reducing Leucine Intake	Many studies have shown that calorie restriction, without malnutrition, can increase lifespan and lower the risk of age-related diseases, such as cancer. However, for many people, calorie restriction clearly has its drawbacks. In the classic Minnesota Starvation Study, many of the volunteers suffered a preoccupation with food, constant hunger, binge eating, and lots of emotional and psychological issues. Even researchers who study caloric restriction rarely practice it. There’s got to be a better way to suppress the aging engine enzyme, TOR (see Why Do We Age? for more on TOR). That’s why researchers were so excited about rapamycin, a drug that inhibits TOR, thinking it could be caloric restriction in a pill. But like any drug, it a long list of potentially serious side effects. There’s got to be a better way. The breakthrough came when scientists discovered that the benefits of dietary restriction may be coming not from restricting calories, but from restricting protein intake (See my video Caloric Restriction vs. Animal Protein Restriction). If we look at the first comprehensive, comparative meta-analysis of dietary restriction, “the proportion of protein intake was more important for life extension than the degree of caloric restriction.” In fact, just “reducing protein without any changes in calorie level have been shown to have similar effects as caloric restriction.” That’s good news. Protein restriction is much less difficult to maintain than dietary restriction, and it may even be more powerful because it suppresses both TOR and IGF-1, the two pathways thought responsible for the dramatic longevity and health benefits of caloric restriction. Some proteins are worse than others. One amino acid in particular, leucine, appears to exert the greatest effect on TOR. In fact, just cutting down on leucine may be nearly as effective as cutting down on all protein. Where is leucine found? Predominantly animal foods: eggs, dairy, and meat (including chicken and fish). Plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans, have much less. “In general, lower leucine levels are only reached by restriction of animal proteins.” To reach the leucine intake provided by dairy or meat, we’d have to eat nine pounds of cabbage—about four big heads—or 100 apples. These calculations exemplify the extreme differences in leucine amounts provided by a conventional diet in comparison to a plant-based diet. The functional role of leucine in regulating TOR activity may help explain the extraordinary results reported in the Cornell-Oxford-China Study, “since quasi-vegan diets of modest protein content tend to be relatively low in leucine.” This may also help explain the longevity of populations like the Okinawa Japanese, who have about half our mortality rate. The traditional Okinawan diet is only about 10% protein, and practically no cholesterol, because they ate almost exclusively plants. Less than one percent of their diet was fish, meat, eggs, and dairy – the equivalent of one serving of meat a month and one egg every two months. Their longevity is surpassed only by vegetarian Adventists in California, who have perhaps the highest life expectancy of any formally studied population in history. This reminds me of the study I profiled in The Benefits of Caloric Restriction Without the Actual Restricting. Methionine is another amino acid that may be associated with aging. See Methionine Restriction as a Life Extension Strategy to find out which foods to avoid in that case. Both leucine and methionine content may be additional reasons why Plant Protein is Preferable. Other reasons why those eating plant-based diets may live longer:  This all may help explain the results of Harvard’s Meat and Mortality Studies. 	-	Adventist Health Studies,aging,animal products,animal protein,apples,beans,cabbage,California,caloric restriction,chicken,China Study,cholesterol,dairy,Dr. T.

A-176	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/11/exploiting-autophagy-to-live-longer/	Exploiting Autophagy to Live Longer	Thanks to advances in modern medicine, we are living longer lives, but we’re doing it by lengthening the morbidity phase. In other words, we live longer, but sicker, lives (see my video: Americans Are Live Longer, but Sicker Lives). So, traditional medicine increases the number of old people in bad health. Ideally, though, we’d extend lifespan by slowing aging to delay the onset of deterioration, rather than extending the period of deterioration. That’s exactly what a new compound appears to do. It sounds like science fiction. A bacteria in a vial of dirt taken from a mysterious island creating a compound that prolongs life. And not in the traditional medical sense. Researchers in a study profiled in my video, Why Do We Age?, called it rapamycin—named after the bacteria’s home, Easter Island, which is known locally as Rapa Nui. Rapamycin inhibits an enzyme called TOR, or “target of rapamycin.” TOR may be a master determinant of lifespan and aging. The action of TOR has been described as the engine of a speeding car without brakes. Rather than thinking of aging as slowly rusting, a better analogy may be a speeding car that enters the low-speed zone of adulthood and damages itself because it does not and cannot slow down. Why don’t living organisms have brakes? Because they’ve never needed them. In the wild, animals don’t live long enough to experience aging. Most die before they even reach adulthood. The same used to be true for humans. For example, just a few centuries ago, average life expectancy in London was less than 16 years old. Therefore, living beings need to grow as fast as possible to start reproduction before they die from external causes. The best evolutionary strategy may be to run at full speed. However, once we pass the finish line, once we win the race to pass on our genes, we’re still careening forward at an unsustainable pace, all thanks to this enzyme TOR. In our childhood, TOR is an engine of growth, but in adulthood, it is the engine of aging. “Nature simply selects for the brightest flame, which in turn casts the darkest shadow.” Sometimes, though, even in our youth, our bodies need to turn down the heat. When we were evolving, there were no grocery stores; periodic famine was the norm. So sometimes even young people had to slow down or they might never even make it to reproductive age. So we did evolve one braking mechanism: caloric restriction. Caloric restriction may extend lifespan mainly through the inhibition of TOR. When food is abundant, TOR activity goes up, prompting the cells in our body to divide. When TOR detects that food is scarce, it shifts the body into conservation mode, slowing down cell division and kicking in a process called autophagy, from the Greek auto meaning “self,” and phagy meaning “to eat.” Autophagy essentially means eating yourself. Our body realizes there isn’t much food around and starts rummaging through our cells looking for anything we don’t need. Defective proteins, malfunctioning mitochondria, stuff that isn’t working anymore, and cleans house. Clears out all the junk and recycles it into fuel or new building materials, renewing our cells. So caloric restriction has been heralded as a fountain of youth. The potential health and longevity benefits of such a diet regimen may be numerous, but symptoms may include dropping our blood pressure too low, loss of libido, menstrual irregularities, infertility, loss of bone, cold sensitivity, loss of strength, slower wound healing, and psychological conditions such as depression, emotional deadening, and irritability. And you walk around starving all the time! There’s got to be a better way, and there is. Check out my video Caloric Restriction vs. Animal Protein Restriction.

A-178	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/04/blood-type-diet-debunked/	Blood Type Diet Perceived as "Crass Fraud"	It was Adolf Hitler who coined a propaganda technique he called, “The Big Lie,” arguing that people may be more likely to believe colossal untruths, because they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously, so in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility. Dr. Peter D’Adamo’s book Eat Right for Your Type makes the astounding claim that people with different blood types should eat different foods. Type O’s, for example, are supposed to be like the hunter and eat a lot of meat, whereas type A’s are supposed to eat less. A 2013 systematic review of the evidence supporting blood type diets was published in one of the world’s most prestigious nutrition journals. The researchers didn’t find any. The researchers sifted through over a thousand papers that might shed some light on the issue, and none of the studies showed an association between blood type diets and health-related outcomes. They conclude that “there is currently no evidence that an adherence to blood type diets will provide health benefits, despite the substantial presence and perseverance of blood type diets within the health industry.” Ten years earlier, the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association released a number of papers that came out of a day-long scientific seminar held by the Norwegian Society for Nutrition. 40,000 copies of the Eat Right for Your Type had been sold in Norway, and so the researchers sought to determine whether blood type diets were visionary science or nonsense. They also concluded that they are nonsense. The author of the blood type diet book responded to the review on his website, saying that “there is good science behind the blood type diet, just like there was good science behind Einstein’s mathematical calculations.” He says that if blood type diets were just tested in the right way, like  Einstein’s E=MC2, he would be vindicated. The reason we don’t see any studies on blood types and nutrition, he complains, is “because of little interest and available money.” But he’s sold more than seven million books. Why doesn’t he fund his own studies? That’s what the Atkins Corporation did. In fact, he has! In 1996, he wrote, “I am beginning the eighth year of a ten year trial on reproductive cancers, using the Blood Type Diets … By the time I release the results in another 2 years, I expect to make it scientifically demonstrable that the Blood Type Diet plays a role in cancer remission.” OK, so that would be 1998. The results? Still not released, sixteen years later. Good tactic, though, saying you’re just about to publish a study and banking that nobody would actually follow up. So in his sequel, he said he was currently conducting a “twelve-week randomized, double-blind, controlled trial implementing the Blood Type Diet, to determine its effects on the outcomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.” (See my video Blood Type Diet Debunked). That was ten years ago. As my Norwegian colleague bemoaned, “it is difficult not to perceive the whole thing as a crass fraud.” So rarely are popular press diet books afforded such fact-checking. Kudos to these researchers. If only we had this 13 years ago when the book was on the bestseller list! I have a few videos on popular diets, such as: I also wrote a book about low-carb diets, which is now available free online full-text at AtkinsFacts.org.

A-179	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/06/02/why-do-heart-doctors-favor-surgery-and-drugs-over-diet/	Why Do Heart Doctors Favor Surgery and Drugs Over Diet?	When he was a surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. published a controversial paper in the American Journal of Cardiology, highlighted in my video, Fully Consensual Heart Disease Treatment, noting that heart bypass operations carry significant risks including the potential to cause further heart damage, stroke, and brain dysfunction. Angioplasty isn’t much better, also carrying significant mortality and morbidity, and often doesn’t work (in terms of decreasing the risk of subsequent heart attack or death). “So,” he writes, “it seems we have an enormous paradox. The disease that is the leading killer of men and women in Western civilization is largely untreated.” The benefits of bypass surgery and angioplasty “are at best temporary and erode over time, with most patients eventually succumbing to their disease.” In cancer management, we call that palliative care, where we just kind of throw up our hands, throw in the towel, and give up actually trying to treat the disease. Why does this juggernaut of invasive procedures persist? Well one reason he suggests is that performing surgical interventions has the potential for enormous financial reward. Conversely, lack of adequate return is considered one of the barriers to the practice of preventive cardiology. Diet and lifestyle interventions lose money for the physician. Another barrier is that doctors don’t think patients want it. Physician surveys show that doctors often don’t even bring up diet and lifestyle options because they assume that patients would prefer to be on cholesterol-lowering drugs every day for the rest of their lives rather than change their eating habits. That may be true for some, but it’s up to the patient, not the doctor, to decide. According to the official AMA Code of Medical Ethics, physicians are supposed to disclose all relevant medical information to patients. “The patient’s right of self-decision can be effectively exercised only if the patient possesses enough information to enable an informed choice. The physician’s obligation is to present the medical facts accurately to the patient.” For example, before starting someone at moderate risk on a cholesterol-lowering statin drug, a physician might ideally say something like: “You should know that for folks in your situation, the number of individuals who must be treated with a statin to prevent one death from a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke is generally between 60 and 100, which means that if I treated 60 people in your situation, 1 would benefit and 59 would not. As these numbers show, it is important for you to know that most of the people who take a statin will not benefit from doing so and, moreover, that statins can have side effects, such as muscle pain, liver damage, and upset stomach, even in people who do not benefit from the medication. I am giving you this information so that you can weigh the risks and benefits of drugs versus diet and then make an informed decision.” Yet, how many physicians have these kinds of frank and open discussions with their patients? Non-disclosure of medical information by doctors—that kind of paternalism is supposed to be a thing of the past. Today’s physicians are supposed to honor informed consent under all but a very specific set of conditions (such as the patient is in a coma or it’s an emergency). However, too many physicians continue to treat their patients as if they were unconscious. At the end of this long roundtable discussion on angioplasty and stents, the editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Cardiology reminded us of an important fact to place it all in context. Atherosclerosis is due to high cholesterol, which is due to poor dietary choices, so if we all existed on a plant-based diet, we would not have even needed this discussion. The lack of nutrition training in medical school is another barrier. See, for example, my videos Doctors’ Nutritional Ignorance and Doctors Know Less Than They Think About Nutrition. Shockingly, mainstream medical associations actively oppose attempts to educate physicians about clinical nutrition. See my 4-part video series: For more on why doctors don’t make more dietary prescriptions, see my video The Tomato Effect, Lifestyle Medicine: Treating the Cause of Disease, and Convincing Doctors to Embrace Lifestyle Medicine.

A-180	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/28/phytates-in-beans-anti-nutrient-or-anti-cancer/	Phytates in Beans: Anti-Nutrient or Anti-Cancer?	In my videos, Phytates in the Prevention of Cancer and Phytates for Rehabilitating Cancer Cells, I described how phytates in beans may be the reason why legumes are so successful in preventing cancer and re-educating cancer cells. What about phytates for the treatment of cancer? Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It arises from “adenomatous polyps,” meaning that colon cancer starts out as a benign little bump called a polyp and then grows into cancer that can eventually spread to other organs and kill. So the National Cancer Institute funded the Polyp Prevention Trial, highlighted in my video, Phytates for the Treatment of Cancer, to determine the effects of a high-fiber, high fruit and vegetable, low-fat diet. Researchers found no significant associations between polyp formation and overall change in fruit and vegetable consumption. However, those with the greatest increase in bean intake only had about a third of the odds of advanced polyps popping up. It could have been the fiber in the beans, but there’s lots of fiber in fruits and vegetables, too. So it may have been the phytate. If the tumors develop from polyps, they still need to spread. Tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis are multistep processes that include cell proliferation, digestion through the surrounding tissue, and migration through barrier membranes to reach the bloodstream so the tumor can establish new proliferating colonies of cancer cells. A critical event in tumor cell invasion is the first step: the tunneling through the surrounding matrix. To do this, the cancer cells use a set of enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases. This is where phytates might come in. We’ve known that phytates inhibit cancer cell migration in vitro, and now perhaps we know why. Phytates help block the ability of cancer cells to produce the tumor invasion enzyme in the first place (at least for human colon and breast cancer cells). So what happens if you give phytates to breast cancer patients? Although a few case studies where phytates were given in combination with chemotherapy clearly showed encouraging data, organized, controlled, randomized clinical studies were never done—until now. Fourteen women with invasive breast cancer were divided randomly into two  groups. One group got extra phytates; the other got placebo. At the end of six months, the phytate group had a better quality of life, significantly more functionality, fewer symptoms from the chemo, and did not get the drop in immune cells and platelets chemo patients normally experience. What are the potential side effects of phytates? Less heart disease, less diabetes, and fewer kidney stones. Because cancer development is such an extended process—it can take decades to grow—we need cancer preventive agents that we can take long-term. Phytates, which naturally occur in beans, grains, nuts, and seeds, seem to fit the bill. In the past, there were concerns that the intake of foods high in phytates might reduce the bioavailability of dietary minerals, but recent studies demonstrate that this co-called “anti-nutrient” effect can be manifested only when large quantities of phytates are consumed in combination with a nutrient poor diet. For example, there used to be a concern that phytate consumption might lead to calcium deficiency, which then led to weakened bones, but researchers discovered that the opposite was true, that phytates actually protect against osteoporosis (See Phytates for the Prevention of Osteoporosis). In essence, phytates have many characteristics of a vitamin, contrary to the established and, unfortunately, still existing dogma among nutritionists regarding its ‘anti-nutrient’ role. As one paper in the International Journal of Food Science & Technology suggests: “Given the numerous health benefits, phytates participation in important intracellular biochemical pathways, normal physiological presence in our cells, tissues, plasma, urine, etc., the levels of which fluctuate with intake, epidemiological correlates of phytate deficiency with disease and reversal of those conditions by adequate intake, and safety – all strongly suggest for phytates inclusion as an essential nutrient, perhaps a vitamin.” The paper concludes that inclusion of phytates in our diet for prevention and therapy of various ailments, cancer in particular, is warranted.

A-181	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/26/how-phytates-fight-cancer-cells/	How Phytates Fight Cancer Cells	Phytate is a compound found in beans, grains, nuts and seeds. The average daily intake of phytate in vegetarian diets is about twice that of those eating mixed diets of plant and animal foods, which may help explain their low cancer rates. Aside from helping to prevent cancer, dietary phytate has been reported to help prevent kidney stone formation, protect against diabetes mellitus, dental cavities, and heart disease. Do all these potentially beneficial effects sound too good to be true? Are there other examples of compounds made by plants that can have benefits across multiple diseases? Why yes! Aspirin, for example, which is found throughout the plant kingdom may also account for a variety of plant-based benefits (See Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods). But of all the things phytates can do, the anticancer activity of phytate (also known as phytic acid, IP6, or inositol hexaphosphate), is considered one of its most important beneficial activities.  Dietary phytates are quickly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly taken up by cancer cells throughout the body, and have been shown to inhibit the growth of all tested cancerous cell lines in vitro. Phytates have been shown to inhibit the growth of human leukemia cells, colon cancer cells, both estrogen receptor-positive and negative breast cancer cells, voicebox cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, liver tumors, pancreatic, melanoma, and muscle cancers. All at the same time not affecting normal cells. That’s the most important expectation of a good anticancer agent: the ability to only affect cancerous cells and to leave normal cells alone. In my video, Phytates for Rehabilitating Cancer Cells, you can see how leukemia cells taken from cancer patients are killed by phytates, whereas normal bone marrow cells, are spared. This may explain why bean extracts kill off colon cancer cells in vitro, but leave normal colon cells alone. What are the mechanisms of action by which phytates battle cancer? In other words, how do phytates fight? How don’t they fight? Phytate targets cancer through multiple pathways, a combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune-enhancing activities, detox, differentiation, and anti-angiogenesis. In other words, phytate appears to affect all the principal pathways of malignancy. The antioxidative property is one of the most impressive characteristics of phytate. In fact that’s why the meat industry adds phytates to meat to prevent the fat oxidation that begins at the moment of slaughter. Phytates can also act on our immune functions by augmenting natural killer cell activity, the cells in our body that hunt down and dispose of cancer cells, as well as neutrophils, which help form our first line of defense. And then phytates starve tumors as more of a last line of defense. Not only can phytates block the formation of new blood vessels that may be feeding tumors, but disrupt pre-formed capillary tubes, indicating that phytates may not just help blockade tumors, but actively cut off existing supply lines. What’s really remarkable about phytate, though, is that unlike most other anti-cancer agents, it not only causes a reduction in cancer cell growth but also enhances differentiation, meaning it causes cancer cells to stop acting like cancer cells and go back to acting like normal cells. You can see this with colon cancer cells for example. In the presence of phytates, human colon cancer cells mature to structurally and behaviorally resemble normal cells. And this has been demonstrated in leukemia cells, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and muscle cancer cells as well. For more on the cancer and phytate connection, check out Phytates for the Prevention of Cancer and Phytates for the Treatment of Cancer. This video reminds me of my video on the spice, turmeric, Turmeric Curcumin Reprogramming Cancer Cell Death. What else can we eat to improve the cancer-fighting front of our immune system?

A-182	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/21/colon-cancer-prevention-is-it-the-fiber-or-the-phytates/	Colon Cancer Prevention: Is it the Fiber or the Phytates?	Dietary factors are considered the most important environmental risk factors for cancer. Within recent years, a large number of naturally occurring health-enhancing substances of plant origin known as phytonutrients have been recognized to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. Beans, chickpeas, split peas and lentils are packed with all sorts of wonderful nutrients, but the reason they may protect against several degenerative diseases may be due to non-nutritive compounds, or even so-called “antinutrient” compounds like phytates. Phytates have a somewhat negative reputation for binding to certain minerals (like iron, zinc and manganese) and slowing their absorption. But they have also been found to offer anti-inflammatory health benefits. “The reputation of phytate has had a roller coaster ride ever since its discovery; it has undergone alternate eminence and infamy.” (I previously explored the surprising new science about phytates in my video Phytates for the Prevention of Osteoporosis). Could they play a potential role in preventing colon cancer? In the U.S., colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death, but some parts of the world have had just a tiny fraction of our rates, with the highest rates reported in Connecticut, and the lowest in Kampala, Uganda. The famous surgeon Denis Burkitt spent 24 years in Uganda and most of the hospitals he contacted there had never seen a case of colon cancer. Noting they live off diets centered on whole plant foods, he figured that maybe it was the fiber that was so protective. Some studies have called that interpretation into question. Danes appear to have more colon cancer than Finns, yet Danes consume almost twice the dietary fiber. What else, then, could explain the low cancer rates among plant-based populations? Well, fiber isn’t the only thing found in whole plant foods, but missing from processed and animal foods. Maybe it’s the phytate. Dietary phytate, rather than fiber per se, may be the most important variable governing the frequency of colon cancer, as phytate is known to be a powerful inhibitor of the iron-mediated production of hydroxyl radicals, a particularly dangerous type of free radical. So the standard American diet may be a double whammy, the heme iron in muscle meat plus the lack of phytate in refined plant foods to extinguish the iron radicals. This may account for what researchers found in the Adventist study, highlighted in my video, Phytates for the Prevention of Cancer. They found excess risk of cancer for higher intakes of both red meat and white meat, suggesting all meats contribute to colon cancer formation — about twice the risk for red meat eaters, and three times the risk for those eating chicken and fish. Those who eat meat could reduce their risk in two ways: by cutting down on meat or by eating more beans, an excellent source of phytates. So it’s not just how much meat we eat, but our meat to vegetables ratio. Between the two extremes (high-vegetable and low-meat diets versus high-meat and low-vegetable diets) a risk ratio of about eight appears to exist, sufficient to explain a substantial part of the international variation in the incidence of colorectal cancer. Those with the worst of both worlds, high meat and low vegetable, were at eight times the risk. More on colon cancer in Stool Size Matters. Here are a few of my latest videos on the latest wonders of the musical fruit: What about that music, though? See my blog Beans and Gas: Clearing the air. What about soybeans and cancer? See Breast Cancer Survival and Soy and BRCA Breast Cancer Genes and Soy. Other ways to mediate the effects of meat intake can be found in my video Reducing Cancer Risk in Meateaters.

A-183	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/19/low-carb-diets-and-coronary-blood-flow/	Low Carb Diets Found to Feed Heart Disease	People going on low carb diets may not see a rise in their cholesterol levels. How is that possible? Because weight loss by any means can drop our cholesterol. We could go on an all-Twinkie diet and lower our cholesterol as long as we didn’t eat too many. A good cocaine habit could do it. Anything that drops our weight can drop our cholesterol, but the goal isn’t to fit into a skinnier casket; the reason we care about cardiovascular risk factors like cholesterol is because we care about cardiovascular risk, the health of our arteries. Now we have studies that measure the impact of low carb diets on arteries directly, and a review of all the best studies to date found that low-carb diets impair arterial function, as evidenced by a decrease in flow-mediated dilation, meaning low-carb diets effectively stiffen people’s arteries. And since that meta-analysis was published, a new study found the same thing: “A dietary pattern characterized by high protein and fat, but low carbohydrate was associated with poorer peripheral small artery function,” again measuring blood flow into people’s limbs. But peripheral circulation is not as important as the circulation in the coronary arteries that feed our heart. There has only been one study ever done measuring actual blood flow to the heart muscles of people eating low-carb diets. Dr. Richard Fleming, an accomplished nuclear cardiologist, enrolled 26 people into a comprehensive study of the effects of diet on cardiac function using the latest in nuclear imaging technology–so-called SPECT scans, enabling him to actually directly measure the blood flow within the coronary arteries. He then put them all on a healthy vegetarian diet, and a year later the scans were repeated. By that time, however, ten of the patients had jumped ship onto the low carb bandwagon. At first I bet he was disappointed, but surely soon realized he had an unparalleled research opportunity dropped into his lap. Here he had extensive imaging of ten people before and after following a low carb diet and 16 following a high carb diet. What would their hearts look like at the end of the year? We can talk about risk factors all we want, but compared to the veg group, did the coronary heart disease of the patients following the Atkins-like diets improve, worsen, or stay the same? Those sticking to the vegetarian diet showed a reversal of their heart disease as expected. Their partially clogged arteries literally got cleaned out. They had 20% less atherosclerotic plaque in their arteries at the end of the year than at the beginning. What happened to those who abandoned the treatment diet, and switched over to the low-carb diet? Their condition significantly worsened. 40% to 50% more artery clogging at the end of the year.  In heart scans of the patients, as seen in my video, Low Carb Diets and Coronary Blood Flow, the yellow and particularly red areas represent blood flow through the coronary arteries to the heart muscle. The scan of one of the patients who went on a plant-based diet, shows how their arteries opened right up increasing the blood flow. Another person, however, started out with good flow, but after a year on a low-carb diet, they significantly clogged down their arterial blood flow. So this is the best science we have, demonstrating the threat of low-carb diets, not just measuring risk factors, but actual blood flow in people’s hearts on different diets. Of course the reason we care about cardiac blood flow, is we don’t want to die. Another meta-analysis was recently published that finally went ahead and measured the ultimate end-point, death, and low-carb diets were associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality, meaning living a significantly shorter lifespan. The reason I have so few videos about low-carb diets is that I already wrote a book about it. Carbophobia is now available free online full-text at AtkinsFacts.org. Atkins’ lawyers threatened to sue, leading to a heated exchange you’re sure to enjoy that I reprint in the book. I did touch on it Atkins Diet: Trouble Keeping it Up, though low carb diets don’t necessarily have to be that unhealthy (see my video Plant-Based Atkins Diet).

A-184	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/12/how-curry-can-kill-cancer-cells/	How Curry Can Kill Cancer Cells	It is estimated that the human body consists of ten or so trillion cells. Almost all of these cells get turned over within approximately 100 days. That means we’re like a new person every three months. We reinvent ourselves physically. And since we’re physically made of air, water, and food—those are essentially the only inputs—we are what we eat, literally and physically. In a sense our body has to rebuild itself every three months with the building materials we deliver to it through our stomach. Our mouths are like the access road to the continual construction site of our body. Trucks roll in three times a day. What do we want them to deliver? Some shoddy cheap stuff we scrounged around for or bought at the discount outlets that’s just going to fall apart? Or do we want to build our foundation solid? We are each walking inside the greatest known architectural structures in the universe. Let’s not ruin such grand blueprints by consuming junk. We only own the biological real estate we’re born with, so if we need to rebuild every three months, we also need a wrecking crew. If we’re replacing ten trillion cells every hundred days, that means we have to kill off about 100 billion cells every day. Out with the old, in with the new. We do that primarily through “apoptosis,” pre-programmed cell death (from the Greek ptosis, meaning “falling”, and apo, “away from”). For example, we all used to have webbed fingers and toes. Literally. Each one of us did in the womb until about four months, when apoptosis kicked in, and the cells in the webbing kill themselves off to separate our fingers. However, some cells overstay their welcome: cancer cells. They don’t die when they’re supposed to by somehow turning off their suicide genes. What can we do about that? Well, one of the ways the yellow pigment in curry powder kills cancer cells is by reprogramming the self-destruct mechanism back into cancer cells. Let me just run through one of these pathways. FAS is a so-called death receptor that activates the FAS associated death domain, death receptor five, and death receptor four. The FADD associated death domain then activates caspase-8, which “ignites the death machine,” and kills the cell. (To see the diagram of the pathway, go to my video Turmeric Curcumin Reprogramming Cancer Cell Death). Where does curry powder fit into all this? In cancer cells, curcumin, the pigment in the spice turmeric that makes curry powder yellow, upregulates and activates death receptors (as shown in human kidney cancer cells, skin cancer cells, and nose and throat cancer cells). Curcumin can also activate the death machine directly (as shown in lung cancer and colon cancer). Caspases are so-called “executioner enzymes,” that when activated, destroy the cancer cell from within by chopping up proteins left and right—kind of like death by a thousand cuts. And that’s just one pathway. Curcumin can also affect apoptosis in a myriad other ways, affecting a multitude of different types of cancer cells. It also tends to leave normal cells alone for reasons that are not fully understood. Overall, researchers “showed that curcumin can kill a wide variety of tumor cell types through diverse mechanisms. And because curcumin can affect numerous mechanisms of cell death at the same time, it’s possible that cancer cells may not easily develop resistance to curcumin-induced cell death like they do to most chemotherapy.” For more on turmeric and cancer, check out Back to Our Roots: Curry and Cancer and Carcinogen Blocking Effects of Turmeric. Other herbs and spices such as garlic and amla have similar selective effects against cancer cell (See #1 Anticancer Vegetable and Some Ayurvedic Medicine Worse than Lead Paint Exposure).

A-185	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/05/05/why-are-cancer-rates-so-low-in-india/	Why are Cancer Rates so Low in India?	It is estimated that many tumors start around the age of 20. However, detection of cancer is normally around the age of 50 or later. Thus, it takes cancer decades to incubate. Why does it take so long? Recent studies indicate that in any given type of cancer, hundreds of different genes must be modified to change a normal cell into a cancer cell. Although cancers are characterized by the dysregulation of cell signaling pathways at multiple steps, most current anticancer therapies involve the modulation of a single target. Chemotherapy has gotten incredibly specific, but the ineffectiveness, lack of safety, and high cost of these monotargeted therapies has led to real disappointment, and drug companies are now trying to develop chemo drugs that take a multitargeted approach. Many plant-based products, however, accomplish multitargeting naturally and are inexpensive and safe compared to drugs. However, because drug companies are not usually able to secure intellectual property rights to plants, the development of plant-based anticancer therapies has not been prioritized. They may work (and work better for all we know), and they may be safer, or even fully risk free. If we were going to choose one plant-based product to start testing, we might choose curcumin, the pigment in the spice turmeric (the reason curry powder looks yellow). Before we start throwing money at research, we might want to ask some basic questions, like “Do populations that eat a lot of turmeric have lower cancer rates?” The incidence of cancer does appear to be significantly lower in regions where turmeric is heavily consumed. Population-based data indicate that some extremely common cancers in the Western world are much less prevalent in regions where turmeric is widely consumed in the diet. For example, “overall cancer rates are much lower in India than in western countries.”  U.S. men get 23 times more prostate cancer than men in India. Americans get between 8 and 14 times the rate of melanoma, 10 to 11 times more colorectal cancer, 9 times more endometrial cancer, 7 to 17 times more lung cancer, 7 to 8 times more bladder cancer, 5 times more breast cancer, and 9 to 12 times more kidney cancer. This is not mere 5, 10, or 20 percent more, but 5, 10, or 20 times more. Hundreds of percent more breast cancer, thousands of percent more prostate cancer—differences even greater than some of those found in the China Study. The researchers in this study, highlighted in my video Back to Our Roots: Curry and Cancer, conclude: “Because Indians account for one-sixth of the world’s population, and have some of the highest spice consumption in the world, epidemiological studies in this country have great potential for improving our understanding of the relationship between diet and cancer. The lower rates of cancer may, of course, not be due to higher spice intake. Several dietary factors may contribute to the low overall rate of cancer in India. Among them are a “relatively low intake of meat and a mostly plant-based diet, in addition to the high intake of spices.” Forty percent of Indians are vegetarians, and even the ones that do eat meat don’t eat a lot. And it’s not only what they don’t eat, but what they do. India is one of the largest producers and consumers of fresh fruits and vegetables, and Indians eat a lot of pulses (legumes), such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils. They also eat a wide variety of spices in addition to turmeric that constitute, by weight, the most antioxidant-packed class of foods in the world. Population studies can’t prove a correlation between dietary turmeric and decreased cancer risk, but they can certainly inspire a bunch of research. So far, curcumin has been tested against a variety of human cancers, including colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast, prostate, multiple myeloma, lung cancer, and head and neck cancer, for both prevention and treatment. For more information on turmeric and curcumin, check out Carcinogen Blocking Effects of Turmeric Curcumin and Turmeric Curcumin Reprogramming Cancer Cell Death. I’m working on another dozen or so videos on this amazing spice. This is what I have so far: Amla, dried Indian gooseberry powder, is another promising dietary addition: I add amla to my Pink Juice with Green Foam recipe. Not all natural products from India are safe, though. See, for example, my video Some Ayurvedic Medicine Worse than Lead Paint Exposure.

A-186	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/28/how-to-reduce-exposure-to-alkylphenols-through-your-diet/	How to Reduce Exposure to Alkylphenols Through Your Diet	Alkylphenols are industrial chemicals that are found in hair products, spermicides, cleaning products and detergents. They are considered endocrine disruptors. For more information on alkylphenols, check out my video Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies. Concern about alkylphenols first surfaced decades ago when a group at Tufts observed an excessive proliferation of human breast cancer cells in certain types of plastic containers, something that would normally only be seen if the cells were exposed to some type of estrogen. They identified an alkylphenol leaching from the plastic as the culprit, having “estrogen-like properties when tested in the human breast tumor cells.” Excessive proliferation of human breast cancer cells is never good, so countries in Europe started banning and restricting the use of these chemicals. However, the U.S. EPA has been slow to respond. A half million tons of alkylphenols continue to spew out into the environment every year, so much so that now that they come down in the rain and then accumulate up the food chain. One study, highlighted in my video, Dietary Sources of Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors, examined the Japanese food supply to find out which foods had these potentially allergy-exacerbating endocrine disruptors. The researchers found that chicken and fish had the highest levels. Water animals and birds concentrate these compounds to levels several thousands of times greater than those in the environment because these are fat-soluble chemicals. “Therefore, they can easily contaminate foods of animal origin, which are thought to represent the most important source of human exposure to many organic pollutants,” not just the alkylphenols. Another research group also found that fish was the worst. Which kind of fish? Anchovies, mackerel, salmon and cod seem to have the highest levels. In fact, salmon was the only food found contaminated with nonylphenol diethoxylate, which is even more potent than regular nonylphenol. The levels of contamination in fish were at the concentrations that start to make breast cancer cells go crazy in vitro. These findings are consistent with the fact that seafood consumption has been associated with severe asthma, current and severe rhinoconjunctivitis, (seasonal pollen allergies), and current and severe eczema (an allergic-type disease of the skin) in adolescent populations around the globe. If these synthetic xenoestrogens are playing a role, what about natural phytoestrogens, such as those found in soy foods? It turns out that in patients with asthma, consumption of a diet with moderate to high amounts of soy phytoestrogens is associated with better lung function and better asthma control. If anything then, it’s these chemical pollutants, which come down in the rain, contaminate the soil, the plants, and then concentrate up the food chain in the fat of animals. We’re now the animals at the top of the food chain, like the polar bear or bald eagle, building up higher levels of these synthetic xenoestrogens. Thankfully, there aren’t many cannibals around anymore. However, there is one group that continues to feed off human tissues—babies (See The Wrong Way to Detox). Alkylphenols have been found to concentrate in human breast milk, particularly in women who eat fish. The highest levels of these endocrine-disrupting pollutants were recorded in milk samples from mothers who said they ate fish at least twice a week, consistent with the fact that seafood consumption represents an important source of alkylphenol intake. Even these “slightly elevated levels of endocrine disruptors in the milk of mothers with a seafood-rich diet may be associated with adverse effects on neurological development, fetal and postnatal growth, and memory functions on breastfed infants, because these contaminants may interfere with the endocrine [hormonal] system.” Since these toxins concentrate in fat, the highest concentrations may be found in straight animal fat, such as chicken fat, lard, tallow, or fish oil. Consumption of fish oil capsules and processed fish products has been associated with alkylphenol concentration in mothers’ milk, again due to bioaccumulation up the food chain. And then we recycle the leftover remains of farm animals into farm animal feed, so the levels can get higher and higher in animal products. As one commentator noted, while these pollutants do contaminate human milk, they also contaminate cow’s milk—humans and cows live in the same polluted world. In fact, infant formula was found to be over five times more contaminated, so breast is still best, absolutely. But these kinds of studies are important in order to provide good suggestions for food choices to nursing mothers to prevent excess exposure to these pollutants in their infants. We can kind of cut out the middlefish and move lower down the food chain in hopes of decreasing our exposure to industrial toxins. Endocrine disruptors have also been linked to conditions such as male infertility (Male Fertility and Diet and Xenoestrogens and Sperm Counts) and early onset of puberty (Protein, Puberty, and Pollutants and Xenoestrogens and Early Puberty). What other industrial pollutants build up in the aquatic fish chain? See, for example: Farmed Fish vs. Wild Caught. Which is worse? How Long to Detox from Fish Before Pregnancy?

A-187	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/23/alkylphenol-endocrine-disruptors-and-allergies/	Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies	In my video Preventing Childhood Allergies, I noted a study in Japan that found higher maternal intake of meat during pregnancy was significantly associated with about three times the odds of both suspected and physician-diagnosed eczema. The researchers suggest that certain components of meat may affect the fetal immune system. But what about the moms, themselves? A plant-based diet may also help alleviate allergies in adults. See Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants and Preventing Allergies in Adulthood. Seasonal allergies have exploded in Japan in the past few decades, starting with the first reported case in 1964 and now affecting millions every year. We’ve seen a rising prevalence of allergic diseases around the industrialized world in past decades, but perhaps nothing quite this dramatic. Some have suggested that profound changes in the Japanese diet may have played a role. Over the latter half of the century total meat, fish, and milk intake rose hundreds of percent in Japan, so researchers decided to look into dietary meat and fat intake and the prevalence of these seasonal pollen allergies. No association with overall fat, but “higher meat intake was significantly associated with an increased prevalence.” Saturated fat wasn’t associated with increased prevalence either, so what other constituents in meat may be to blame? The researchers considered the cooked meat carcinogens, the heterocyclic amines, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and the nitrosamines. A new review, highlighted in my video, Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies, however, raised an intriguing possibility. There’s a class of industrial pollutants called alkylphenols, recognized as common toxic endocrine disrupting chemicals that tend to accumulate in the human body and may be associated with allergic diseases. A variety of studies have shown how they may exacerbate allergen-induced inflammation, “suggesting that alkylphenol exposure may influence the onset, progression, and severity of allergic diseases.” These toxic xenoestrogens can be found in human breast milk, in our body fat, in our urine, in our bloodstream, and even in the umbilical cord blood going to our babies. How did it get there? Through contaminated food. It all goes back to a famous study about the reduction of penis size and testosterone levels in alligators living in a contaminated environment. I don’t know what you do for a day job, but these researchers observed that a population of juvenile alligators living on one lake in Florida exhibited a “significantly smaller penis size” and lower blood concentrations of testosterone compared to animals on some different lake. The most important difference between the two lakes was that Lake Stubby was fed by relatively polluted waters. They attributed the “short penis phenomenon” to estrogen-mimicking (xenoestrogenic) environmental metabolites of DDT that still pollute our Earth. This seminal work introduced the concept of endocrine disruptors. Environmental xenoestrogens might result in feminization of exposed male animals. And that’s just the shriveled tip of the iceberg. Since then, endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been implicated in the dramatic rise over the last 50 years of diseases like breast cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, diabetes, obesity, and fertility (such as dropping normal sperm counts), genital birth defects such as penile malformations, preterm birth, neurobehavioral disorders in children linked to thyroid disruption, and earlier breast development in young girls. Because genes do not change fast enough to explain these increases, environmental causes must be involved. Since our greatest exposure to the environment is through our gut, it’s no surprise that our greatest exposure to these endocrine-disrupting chemicals is through diet. To find out which foods may contain these alkylphenol endocrine disruptors, check out my video Dietary Sources of Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors.

A-188	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/21/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/	Slowing Cognitive Decline with Berries	A plant-based diet is thought to have played a significant role in human evolution and the consumption of whole plant foods and even just extracts have repeatedly been associated with a decreased risk of aging related diseases. And by healthy aging I’m not talking preventing wrinkles, what about protecting our brain? “Two of the most dreaded consequences of dementia with aging are problems moving around and difficulty remembering things. Dementia robs older adults of their independence, control, and identity.” Fruits and vegetables help reduce the risk of other chronic diseases, so might they work for brain diseases as well? There has been a proliferation of recent interest in plant polyphenols as agents in the treatment of dementia. There are 4,000 different kinds of polyphenols found ubiquitously in foods of plant origin, but berries are packed with them, possessing powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. There’s a subset of polyphenols called anthocyanidins, which are found in blue and purple pigmented fruits and berries. These polyphenols are uniquely and specifically capable of “both crossing the blood–brain barrier and localizing in brain regions involved in learning and memory.” And that’s precisely where we need them. The brain takes up less than 2% of body weight but may burn up to 50% of the body’s fuel, creating a potential firestorm of free radicals. Maybe these brain-seeking phytonutrients in berries could fight oxidation and inflammation, and even increase blood flow? This raised a thought-provoking idea. Maybe a “nutritional intervention with blueberries may be effective in forestalling or even reversing the neurological changes associated with aging?” It would be a decade before the first human trial was conducted, but it worked! “Blueberry supplementation improves memory in older adults,” suggesting that “consistent supplementation with blueberries may offer an approach to forestall or mitigate brain degeneration with age.” What other blue or purple foods can we try? Concord grape juice was also tested and had a similar benefit, suggesting that supplementation with purple grape juice may enhance cognitive function for older adults with early memory decline. Why use juice and not whole concord grapes? Because then you couldn’t design a placebo that looked and tasted exactly the same to rule out the very real and powerful placebo effect. And also because the study was funded by the Welch’s grape juice company. This effect was confirmed in a follow-up study, showing for the first time an increase in neural activation in parts of the brain associated with memory using functional MRI scans. But this brain scan study was tiny: just four people in each group. And same problem in the blueberry study: it had only nine people in it. Why haven’t large population-based studies been done? Because we haven’t had good databases on where these phytonutrients are found. We know how much vitamin C is in a blueberry, but not how much anthocyanidin—until now. The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, highlighted in my video, How to Slow Brain Aging by Two Years, followed the cognitive function of more than 16,000 women for years, and found that “long-term consumption of berries was related to significantly slower rates of cognitive decline, even after careful consideration of confounding socioeconomic status” (that is, even after taking into account the fact that rich people eat more berries). The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study was the first population-based evidence that greater intakes of blueberries and strawberries were highly associated with slower rates of cognitive decline, and not just by a little bit. “The magnitude of associations were equivalent to the cognitive differences that one might observe in women up to two and a half years apart in age.” In other words, women with higher intake of berries appeared to have delayed cognitive aging by as much as two and a half years. Why shouldn’t we just take some anthocyanidin supplement? Because there hasn’t been a single study that found any kind of cognitive benefit by just giving single phytonutrients. In fact, the opposite is true. “Whole blueberries appear to be more effective than individual components, showing that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” These findings have potentially substantial public health implications, as increasing berry intake represents a fairly simple dietary modification to test in older adults for maintaining our brain function. What other ways could we improve our memory and cognitive function?  What other near-miraculous properties of berries are there?

A-189	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/16/what-is-meat-glue/	What is ‘Meat Glue’?	The so-called “meat glue enzyme” transglutaminase is used by the meat industry to add value to meat by gluing together smaller scraps into a larger chunk. And it’s not just used to make fake steak—the American Meat Institute estimates that it’s used in about “eight million pounds of meat every year in the United States.” Transglutaminase can be used to cross-link pieces of any type of meat, fish, or meat product, and hence can be used to produce large chunks of virtually intact looking meat or fish out of small meat or fish cuttings. When researchers actually tested for transglutaminase in 20 samples of meat from the supermarket, they found meat glue in only two of the samples—in a sample of salmon and a sample of turkey (See Is Meat Glue Safe?) Where does meat glue come from? For decades, the sole commercial source of transglutaminase was from the livers of guinea pigs. Now it can be sourced much cheaper. However, the future of meat glue remains uncertain because of “communication difficulties.” One of the reasons the industry uses meat glue enzymes is because, “restructured meat can be made from underutilized portions of the carcasses.” For example, you can get away with adding up to 5% tendons to beef, and some people can’t tell the difference. This has raised food safety concerns. There is a “risk that otherwise discarded leftovers of questionable microbial quality could find their way into the reconstituted meat.” One can actually take a microscope and see introduced E. coli O157:H7 along the glue lines where meat pieces were enzymatically attached, which shows that the restructuring process can translocate fecal matter surface contamination into the interior of the meat. Furthermore, people who have problems with gluten may develop problems when ingesting meat treated with the meat glue enzyme, since it functions as an auto-antigen capable of inducing an autoimmune reaction. (Many gluten reactions may not actually be to gluten, though. See my video Is Gluten Sensitivity Real? and most need not worry about gluten sensitivity. See my video Is Gluten Bad For You?). Some meat additives, however, may actually improve food safety. See Meat Additives to Diminish Toxicity, Viral Meat Spray and Maggot Meat Spray. More on E. coli O157:H7 in my video, Meat May Exceed Daily Allowance of Irony.

A-190	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/14/does-liquid-smoke-cause-cancer/	Is Liquid Smoke Safe?	We know smoke inhalation isn’t good for us, but what about smoke ingestion? Decades ago, smoke flavorings were tested to see if they caused DNA mutations in bacteria—the tests came up negative. Even as more and more smoke flavoring was added, the DNA mutation rate remained about the same. But the fact that something is not mutagenic in bacteria may have little predictive value for its effect on human cells. A group at MIT tested a hickory smoke flavoring they bought at the store against two types of human white blood cells. Unlike the bacteria, the mutation rate shot up as more and more liquid smoke was added. But, “there is no evidence that mutagenic activity in a particular human cell line is more closely related to human health risk than is mutagenic activity in bacteria.” In other words: just because liquid smoke causes DNA mutations to human cells in a petri dish, doesn’t mean that it does the same thing within the human body. A good approach may be to just analyze liquid smoke for known carcinogens, chemicals that we know cause cancer. Damaging DNA is just one of many ways chemicals can be toxic to cells. A decade later researchers tested to see what effect liquid smoke had on overall cell viability. If you drip water on cells, nothing happens, they keep powering away at around 100% survival, but drip on more and more wood fire smoke, and you start killing some of the cells off. Cigarette smoke is more toxic, but three out of four of the brands of liquid smoke they bought at the supermarket killed off even more cells, leading them to conclude that the cytotoxic potential of some commercial smoke flavorings is greater than that of liquid cigarette smoke, a finding they no doubt celebrated given that the researchers were paid employees of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Unfortunately they didn’t name names of the offending brands. That’s one of the reasons I was so excited about a new study, where they tested—and named–15 different brands of liquid smoke. This maximum “response” they were measuring was p53 activation. P53 is a protein we make that binds to our DNA, you can see this illustrated in my video, Is Liquid Smoke Flavoring Carcinogenic?. It activates our DNA repair enzymes. So a big p53 response may be indicative of a lot of DNA damage,and a few of the liquid smoke flavorings activated p53 almost as much as a chemotherapy drug like etoposide, whose whole purpose is to break DNA strands. Other flavorings didn’t seem as bad, though there was a hickory smoke powder that ranked pretty high, as did the fish sauce, though smoked paprika didn’t register at all. The p53-activating property in liquid smoke was eliminated by standard baking conditions (350°F for 1h), so if you’re baking something with liquid smoke for long enough, it should eliminate this effect, though just boiling—even for an hour, or slow cooking doesn’t appear to work. They conclude “If the DNA-damaging activities of liquid smoke were thought to be deleterious, it might be possible to replace liquid smoke with other safer, smoky substances.” Why do they say if thought to be deleterious? That’s because they’re not really measuring DNA damage, they’re measuring p53 activation, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. P53 is considered “Guardian of our Genome,” guardian of our DNA. It’s considered a tumor suppressor gene, so if something boosts its activity is that good or bad? It’s like the broccoli story. Cruciferous vegetables dramatically boost our liver’s detoxifying enzymes. Is this because our body sees broccoli as toxic and is trying to get rid of it quicker? Either way, the end result is good, lower cancer risk. It’s a biological phenomenon known as hormesis – that which doesn’t kill us may make us stronger. Like exercise is a stress on the body, but in the right amount can make us healthier in the long run. So, for example, teas and coffees caused p53 activation as well, but their consumption is associated with lower cancer risk. So it’s hard to know what to make of this p53 data. Due to the limitations of the available tests it’s hard to calculate the genotoxic potential of liquid smoke, or any other food for that matter. A better approach may be to just analyze liquid smoke for known carcinogens, chemicals that we know cause cancer. This was first attempted back in 1971. One of the seven liquid smoke flavors researchers tested contained one polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known to be cancer-causing, but there’s a bunch of similar carcinogens researchers didn’t test for. A later study, however, tested across the board, looking specifically at five different carcinogens in retail liquid smoke seasonings. The recommended daily upper safety limit for these carcinogens is 47. Hickory smoke flavoring has only 0.8 per teaspoon, so we’d have to drink three bottles a day to bump up against the limit. And mesquite liquid smoke has only 1.1. It turns out that most of the carcinogens in smoke are fat soluble, so when we make a water-based solution, like liquid smoke, we capture the smoke flavor compounds without capturing most of the smoke cancer compounds. The only time we need to really worry is when eating smoked foods—foods directly exposed to actual smoke. For example, smoked ham has 21.3 per serving, and smoked turkey breast has 26.7 per serving. One sandwich and we may be halfway to the limit, and one serving of barbequed chicken takes us over the top. Eating less than a single drumstick and we nearly double our daily allotment of these carcinogens. Nothing, however, is as bad as fish. Smoked herring? 140 per serving. And smoked salmon? One bagel with lox could take us ten times over the limit. I’ve touched on those cooked meat carcinogens before. In Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens I explored the role of these cooked meat chemicals in tumor growth. PhIP: The Three Strikes Breast Carcinogen explored their role in cancer invasion. Reducing Cancer Risk In Meateaters offered some mediation strategies. Heterocyclic Amines in Eggs, Cheese, and Creatine? showed how even vegetarians may be at risk and Cancer, Interrupted: Green Tea and Cancer, Interrupted: Garlic & Flavonoids explored some counter measures. Some smoke compounds may be a concern even if we don’t eat them. See Meat Fumes: Dietary Secondhand Smoke. Even the smell of frying bacon may be carcinogenic: Carcinogens in the Smell of Frying Bacon. Some plant foods exposed to high temperatures may also present a concern. See Is Yerba Mate Tea Bad for You? and Acrylamide in French Fries. What about Carcinogens in Roasted Coffee?

A-191	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/09/food-antioxidants-stroke-and-heart-disease/	Does Antioxidant Intake Matter for Stroke and Heart Disease?	In my video Food Antioxidants and Cancer, I talked about how antioxidants from whole plants are associated with lower cancer risk. It turns out that total antioxidant capacity of diet may also be protective against stroke, the world’s leading cause of death after heart disease. This is in contradiction to all the antioxidant supplement studies that failed to show benefit. This may be because the food antioxidant studies took into account thousands of different compounds, in doses obtained from a usual diet, rather than individual nutrients at unnaturally high levels. The buildup of oxidized fat is considered the hallmark of fatty streak formation, the earliest manifestation of atherosclerotic plaques. The oxidation of fat can happen outside the body, every time we cook it, but oxidized fats are not only formed in foods, but may also be generated during digestion, especially in stomach acid. Our stomach may be like a “bioreactor for the oxidation of high-fat, cholesterol-rich foods. Muscle foods contain large amounts of endogenous catalysts which accelerate fat oxidation.” As poultry sits in our stomach, the oxidation may build up minute by minute. Turn out chickens are bled of only about half their blood, and the remaining residual can be a powerful promoter of fat oxidation, so there are those in the industry advocating an additional decapitation step, but if oxidation is the problem, antioxidants can be part of the solution. We know antioxidant pills don’t work. While extensive experimental data “have revealed a central role for oxidative stress in the stiffening of our arteries and suggested a potential role for ‘antioxidant’ treatment in cardiovascular disease, experimental data has not translated into clinical benefit. Most antioxidant vitamin trials have failed to reduce heart disease and death and may in fact even be detrimental. As a result, some have even questioned the supposedly central role of oxidative stress in the disease process.” The fact that pills didn’t work was described as a critical blow to the whole free radical theory of aging. But high-dose single-antioxidant supplements are not a good substitute for the very complex antioxidant network of thousands of compounds in foods, present at concentrations far below those used in those pill trials. No one had ever looked at the overall effect of the complex antioxidant network in our diet in relation to our leading killer, coronary heart disease… until now. A large prospective population-based cohort study, highlighted in my video Food Antioxidants, Stroke, and Heart Disease, measured total antioxidant capacity of people’s diets: “The total antioxidant capacity measures, in one single value, the free-radical-reducing capacity of all antioxidants present in foods and all the synergistic effects.” They observed that “higher total antioxidant capacity of diet was statistically significantly associated with lower risk of incident heart attack in a dose-response manner,” meaning, potentially, the more high antioxidant plant foods in one’s diet, the better. Which foods have the highest antioxidant content? See: It’s the heme iron in chicken blood that may be contributing to fat oxidation in the stomach. That’s one of the targets of the Meat Additives to Diminish Toxicity. More on reducing stroke risk can be found in my videos Preventing Strokes with Diet and Whole Grains May Work As Well As Drugs. I have more than 150 videos on heart disease.

A-192	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/04/07/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/	Does Antioxidant Intake Matter for Cancer?	The USDA removed their online antioxidant database of foods, “concerned that ORAC values were routinely misused by food and dietary supplement manufacturing companies to promote their products.” Indeed, supplement manufacturers got into my-ORAC-is-bigger-than-your-ORAC contests, comparing their pills to the antioxidant superfood du jour, like blueberries. We know there are lots of bioactive compounds in whole plant foods that may help prevent and ameliorate chronic disease in ways that have nothing to do with their antioxidant power, so I understand the USDA’s decision. So should we just eat lots of whole healthy plant foods and not worry about which one necessarily has more antioxidants than the other, or does one’s dietary antioxidant intake matter? We have some new data to help answer that question. Researchers recently analyzed total dietary antioxidant capacity and the risk of stomach cancer, the world’s second leading cancer killer. A half million people were studied, and dietary antioxidant capacity intake from different sources of plant foods was indeed associated with a reduction in risk. Note that they say dietary intake; they’re not talking about supplements. Not only do antioxidant pills not seem to help, they seem to increase overall mortality—that’s like paying to live a shorter life. Just giving high doses of isolated vitamins may cause disturbances in our body’s own natural antioxidant network. There are hundreds of different antioxidants in plant foods. They don’t act in isolation; they work synergistically. Mother Nature cannot be trapped in a bottle. Similar results were reported with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: the more ORAC units we eat per day, the lower our cancer risk drops (though antioxidants or not, green leafy vegetables were particularly protective. Going from eating one serving of green leafy vegetables per week to a serving a day may cut our odds of lymphoma in half). Should we be worried about antioxidant intake during cancer treatment, since most chemo drugs work by creating free radicals? According to some of the latest reviews, highlighted in my video Food Antioxidants and Cancer, there is no evidence of antioxidant interference with chemotherapy, and antioxidants may actually improve treatment and patient survival. But should we take a multivitamin? See Should We Take a Multivitamin? What about fish oil supplements? Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil? I recently covered how and why we should strive to eat antioxidants with every meal in an important three-part series: Preferentially getting one’s nutrients from produce not pills is a common theme in the nutrition literature. See, for example: Antioxidants may also slow aging (See Mitochondrial Theory of Aging), reduce inflammation (See Anti-Inflammatory Antioxidants), improve digestion (See Bulking Up on Antioxidants), and help prevent COPD (See Preventing COPD with Diet). So where are antioxidants found? See my series that starts with Antioxidant Content of 3139 Foods and Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. What about the role of antioxidants in other leading causes of death? That’s the subject of my video, Food Antioxidants, Stroke, and Heart Disease. 	-	antioxidants,berries,blueberries,cancer,cancer survival,chemotherapy,chronic diseases,DNA damage,fruit,greens,industry influence,lifespan,lymphoma,mortality,multivitamins,non-Hodgkin lymphoma,nutrient synergy,oxidative stress,ranking foods,stomach cancer,stomach health,supplements,USDA,vegetables	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-stroke-and-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22038870,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22784609,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-a-multivitamin,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072493,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-stroke-and-heart-disease/,http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=15866,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464182,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-antioxidants-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/

A review of the science in new DVD	One of the most common questions I get when I speak is “What do you think about buying organic?” As with any question like this, I first try to gently explain that what I or anyone else thinks doesn’t really matter. What matters is the science: What the best available balance of evidence shows right now. How else could we possibly make decisions for something as critical as the health of ourselves and our families? I put together a 5-part video series summarizing the best science comparing the nutritional content, pesticide risk, heavy metal toxicity, and food poisoning risk of organic versus conventionally raised foods, including a video on practical tips for making your own DIY fruit and vegetable wash: They are all available right now as a video download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 24 (all proceeds go to this charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD. The organic food videos are all scheduled to go up on NutritionFacts.org next month, but you can download and watch them right now. I’m excited to announce that the downloads are now in HD and have all the chapters marked like in the physical DVD. The current batch of videos from volume 23 on NutritionFacts.org just ran out, so starting now and running through June, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 24. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–40+ hours of video–you can get the complete DVD collection. In the image above you can see the list of chapters from the new volume 24 DVD — a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org. Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads. If you were a regular supporter, you’d already be an organic food expert by now, having gotten the new DVD last week! I now come out with new DVDs every 9 weeks. If you’d like to automatically receive them before they’re even available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor. Anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both–your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs. If you’re already signed up and didn’t receive your volume 24 yet, please email Tommasina@NutritionFacts.org and she’ll make everything all better. If you’d rather just watch all the videos online as they launch, but would still like to support my work of helping to educate millions about healthy eating, you can make a tax-deductible donation to my 501c3 nonprofit organization NutritionFacts.org using a credit card, a direct PayPal link, or by sending a check to “NutritionFacts.org” PO Box 11400, Takoma Park, MD 20913. Time and time again you’ve heard me kvetch about the corrupting role money has played in the field of nutritional science. Financial considerations decide which foods get studied, which studies get published, and which findings get disseminated to the public. And when a company funds its own research, you always have to worry if the inherent conflict of interest is biasing the results. That really hit home when I was recording the video, Nutritional Yeast to Prevent the Common Cold. The video ends with a concern that some brands of nutritional yeast may be contaminated with lead. 	-	DVD	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/29/dr-greger-takes-on-mediterranean-diet-in-new-dvd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/05/do-eden-beans-have-too-much-iodine/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/	http://www.DrGreger.org/dates.html,http://www.drgreger.org/downloads,http://www.DrGreger.org/downloads,http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/29/dr-greger-takes-on-mediterranean-diet-in-new-dvd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/research-fund/,http://smile.amazon.com/Latest-Clinical-Nutrition-Michael-Greger/dp/B00UIAQ5QU/&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutritional-yeast-to-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://www.drgreger.org/dvds	
A-194	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/31/does-orange-aromatherapy-reduce-anxiety/	Orange Aromatherapy for Anxiety	Aromatherapy — the use of concentrated essential oils extracted from plants to treat disease — is commonly used to treat anxiety symptoms. Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent class of psychiatric disorders in the general population. However, their treatment is challenging, because the drugs used for the relief of anxiety symptoms can have serious side effects. Thankfully, credible studies that examine the effect of essential oils on anxiety symptoms are gradually starting to appear in the medical literature. However, in most of these studies, exposure to the essential oil odor was accompanied by massage. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effect of the aroma itself. A typical example includes this study where patients in the intensive care unit the day after open-heart surgery got foot massages with orange-scented oil. Why not back massages? Because they just had their chests cracked open so they have huge sternotomy wounds. Patients showed a significant psychological benefit from the aromatherapy massage. But how do we know the essential oil had anything to do with it? Maybe it was just the massage. If that’s the case, then great—let’s give people massages! I’m all for more ICU foot rubs. “There is considerable evidence from randomized trials that massage alone reduces anxiety, so if massage is effective, then aromatherapy plus massage is also effective.” One study where cancer patients got massaged during chemo and radiation even found that the massage without the fragrance may be better. The researchers thought it might be a negative Pavlovian response: the patient smells the citrus and their body thinks, “Oh no, not another cancer treatment!” More recently the ambient odor of orange was tested in a dental office to see if it reduces anxiety and improves mood. Ambient odor of orange was diffused in the waiting room and appeared to have a relaxant effect—less anxiety, better mood, and more calmness—compared to a control group where there was no odor in the air. No odor, that is, except for the nasty dentist office smell. Maybe the orange scent was just masking the unpleasant odors. Maybe it had nothing to do with any orange-specific molecules. More research was necessary. So in another study, highlighted in my video, Orange Aromatherapy for Anxiety, researchers exposed some graduate students to an anxiety-producing situation and tested the scent of orange, versus a non-orange aroma, versus no scent at all. The orange did appear to have an anxiety-reducing effect. Interestingly, the observed anxiety-reducing effects were not followed by physical or mental sedation. On the contrary, at the highest dose, the orange oil made the volunteers feel more energetic. So orange aromatherapy may potentially reduce anxiety without the downer effect of Valium-type drugs. Does that mean we can get the benefits without the side effects? I’ve talked about the concerns of using scented consumer products before, even ones based on natural fragrances (Throw Household Products Off the Scent), and there have been reports of adverse effects of aromatherapy. Alternative medicine isn’t necessarily risk-free. For example, there are dozens of reported cases of people having their hearts ruptured by acupuncture. Ouch. But the adverse effects of aromatherapy were mostly from skin irritation from essential oils being applied topically, or even worse swallowed. Certain citrus oils can also make your skin sensitive to sunlight. Lavender may also help for both anxiety (Lavender for Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and migraines (Lavender for Migraine Headaches). The only other aromatherapy-related video is Wake Up and Smell the Saffron, though I have others on natural ways do reduce anxiety, including:  Natural, though, doesn’t always mean safe. See, for example: Of course eating citrus is good too! I have videos on Reducing Muscle Fatigue With Citrus and Keeping Your Hands Warm With Citrus, but Tell Your Doctor If You Eat Grapefruit. 	-	alternative medicine,anxiety,aromatherapy,benzodiazepines,cancer,chemotherapy,citrus,complementary medicine,fragrance,France,fruit,massage,medications,mental health,oranges,plant-based diets,radiation,side effects,skin health,sunlight,Valium	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/throw-household-products-off-the-scent/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-migraine-headaches/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wake-up-and-smell-the-saffron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936057,http://www.complementarytherapiesinmedicine.com/article/0965-2299%2894%2990156-2/abstract,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12805340,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11134689,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-migraine-headaches/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11511848,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lavender-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21309711,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/orange-aromatherapy-for-anxiety/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/throw-household-products-off-the-scent/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tell-your-doctor-if-you-eat-grapefruit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22849536,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21093944,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wake-up-and-smell-the-saffron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19125379	
A-195	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/26/peeks-behind-the-egg-industry-curtain/	Peeks Behind the Egg Industry Curtain	The American Egg Board is a promotional marketing board appointed by the U.S. government whose mission is to “increase demand for egg and egg products on behalf of U.S. egg producers.” If an individual egg company wants to run an ad campaign, they can say pretty much whatever they want. But if an egg corporation wants to dip into the 10 million dollars the American Egg Board sets aside for advertising every year, because the board is overseen by the federal government, corporations are not allowed to lie with those funds. This leads to quite revealing exchanges between egg corporations that want to use that money and the USDA on what egg companies can and cannot say about eggs. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act I was able to get my hands on some of those emails. Of course a lot of what I got were pages with nearly all of the text blacked out (you can see these in my video, Who Says Eggs Aren’t Healthy or Safe?). But I did find some illuminating correspondence. For example, one email shows an egg company trying to put out a brochure on healthy snacking for kids. But because of existing laws against false and misleading advertising, the head of the USDA’s poultry research and promotion programs reminds the company that eggs or egg products cannot be couched as being healthy or nutritious. “The words nutritious and healthy carry certain connotations, and because eggs have the amount of cholesterol they do, plus the fact that they’re not low in fat, [the words healthy and nutritious] are problematic.” This is the United States Department of Agriculture saying this! However, the USDA official helpfully suggests, “I believe you can say something that’s just as strong if not stronger, that is ‘naturally nutrient-dense.’” Why can we say eggs are nutrient-dense but not nutritious? Because there’s no legal definition of nutrient-dense. We can say Twinkies and Coca Cola are nutrient dense, but legally, we can’t say something is nutritious unless it’s actually… nutritious. For example, the egg industry wanted to run an ad calling eggs a nutritional powerhouse that aids in weight loss. The USDA had to remind the industry that they can’t portray eggs as a diet food because of the fat and cholesterol content. In fact, eggs have nearly twice the calories of anything that can be called “low-calorie.” “Nutritional powerhouse” can’t be used either. Fine, the industry said, they’ll move to plan B, and headline the ad “Egg-ceptional Nutrition.” They couldn’t say that either because, again, given the saturated fat and cholesterol you can’t legally call eggs nutritious. So the headline ended up as, “Find true satisfaction,” and instead of weight loss they had to go with “can reduce hunger.” The USDA congratulated them on their cleverness. Yes, a food that when eaten can reduce hunger—what a concept! They can’t even say eggs are “relatively” low in calories. Can’t say eggs are low in saturated fat—they’re not. Can’t say they’re relatively low in fat, they’re not. Can’t even call them a rich source of protein, because, according to the USDA, they’re not. It’s illegal to advertise that eggs pack a nutritional wallop, or that they have a high nutritional content. Eggs have so much cholesterol, we can’t even say they “contribute nutritionally.” Can’t say eggs are “healthful,” certainly can’t say they’re “healthy.” Can’t even say eggs contribute “healthful components.” Since we can’t say eggs are a healthy start to the day, the USDA suggests a “satisfying start.” Egg corporations can’t call eggs a healthy ingredient, but they can call eggs a “recognizable” ingredient. Can’t truthfully say eggs are good for us, either. By law, according to the USDA, the egg industry “needs to steer clear of words like ‘healthy’ or ‘nutritious.’” For a food to be labeled “healthy” under FDA rules, it has to be low in saturated fat (eggs fail that criteria) and have less than 90mg of cholesterol per serving (even half an egg fails that test). For the same reason we can’t tout ice cream for strong bones, we can’t say eggs are healthy because they exceed the threshold for cholesterol. Egg corporations aren’t even allowed to say things like “Eggs are an important part of a well balanced, healthy diet” on an egg carton because it would be considered misleading according to the USDA’s National Egg Supervisor, since eggs contain significant amounts of fat and cholesterol and therefore can contribute to the leading killer in the United States, heart disease. The industry can’t afford to tell the truth about the eggs, or even the hens that lay them. The industry crams five to ten birds in cages the size of a file cabinet their whole lives, but when providing footage to the media, the American Egg Board instructs, “do not show multiple birds in cages—they look too crowded and open us up to activist criticism.” Not only is the industry barred from saying eggs are healthy, they can’t even refer to eggs as safe because more than a hundred thousand Americans are food poisoned by Salmonella from eggs every year. The egg board’s response to this egg-borne epidemic is that Salmonella is a naturally occurring bacterium. An internal egg industry memo didn’t think that should necessarily be the key message, fearing that “it may be counterproductive by implying there is no avoiding Salmonella in eggs aside from avoiding eggs altogether.” The food poisoning risk is why the American Egg Board can’t even mention anything but eggs cooked hard and dry. No soft-boiled, no over-easy, no sunny-side up—because of the Salmonella risk. The American Egg Board’s own research showed that the sunny-side up cooking method should be considered “unsafe.” In light of bird flu viruses, both the white and yolk must be cooked firm. The VP of marketing for the Egg Board complained to the USDA saying they’d “really like to not have to dictate that the yolks are firm,” and cites a Washington Post article saying runny yolks may be safe for everyone except pregnant women, infants, elderly, or those with chronic disease. It turns out it was a misquote—eggs can’t be considered safe for anyone. Instead of safe, they can call eggs “fresh,” the USDA marketing service helpfully suggests. But they can’t call eggs safe, and they can’t say eggs are “safe to eat.” They can’t even mention safety at all. Wait a second, not only can eggs not be called healthy they can’t even be called safe? Says who? Says the United States Department of Agriculture.

A-196	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/24/whats-driving-americas-obesity-problem/	What’s Driving America’s Obesity Problem?	Currently, nearly two-thirds of Americans are overweight. By 2030 it is estimated more than half our population may be clinically obese. Childhood obesity has tripled, and most children will grow up to be overweight as well. The United States may be in the midst of raising the first generation since our nation’s founding that will have a shorter predicted life span than that of the previous generation. The food industry blames inactivity. We just need to move more, they say. But what is the role of exercise in the treatment of obesity? “There is considerable debate in the medical literature today about whether physical activity has any role whatsoever in the epidemic of obesity that has swept the globe since the 1980s.” The increase in calories per person is more than sufficient to explain the U.S. epidemic of obesity. In fact, if anything, the level of physical activity over the last few decades has actually gone up in both Europe and North America. This has important policy implications. We still need to exercise more, but the priorities for reversing the obesity epidemic should focus on the overconsumption of calories (See How Much Exercise to Sustain Weight Loss?). American children are currently eating about an extra 350 calories (equal to about a can of soda and small fries), and adults are eating about an extra 500 calories (equal to about a Big Mac).  We’d have to walk two hours a day, seven days a week to burn off those calories. So exercise can prevent weight gain, but the amount required to prevent weight gain may be closer to twice the current recommendations. It’s more effective to stick to foods rich in nutrients but poor in calories: see my video Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score. It’s cheaper too, see Best Nutrition Bang For Your Buck. Public health advocates have been experimenting with including this kind of information. One study found that fast food menus labeled with calories and the number of miles to walk to burn those calories appeared the most effective in influencing the selection of lower calorie meals. Exercise alone may have a small effect, and that small effect can make a big difference on a population scale. A 1% decrease in BMI nationwide might prevent millions of cases of diabetes and heart disease and thousands of cases of cancer. But why don’t we lose more weight from exercise? It may be because we’re just not doing it enough. “The small magnitude of weight loss observed from the majority of exercise interventions may be primarily due to low doses of prescribed exercise.” People tend to overestimate how many calories are burned by physical activity. For example, there’s this myth that a bout of sexual activity burns a few hundred calories. So you may think, “Hey, I could get a side of fries with that.” But if we actually hook people up and measure energy expenditure during the act (and the study subjects don’t get too tangled up with all the wires and hoses) it may be only close to the metabolic equivalent of calisthenics. Given that the average bout of sexual activity only lasts about six minutes, a young man might expend approximately 21 calories during sexual intercourse. Due to baseline metabolic needs, he would have spent roughly one third of that just lying around watching TV, so the incremental benefit is plausibly on the order of 14 calories. So maybe he could have one fry with that. I previously touched on this in my video Diet or Exercise, What’s More Important For Weight Loss? Don’t get me wrong–exercise is wonderful!

A-197	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/19/food-manufacturers-get-to-decide-if-their-own-additives-are-safe/	Food Manufacturers Get to Decide if Their Own Additives Are Safe	In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced their plans to all but eliminate trans fats from processed foods, citing a CDC statistic that the elimination of partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply could prevent more than 10,000 heart attacks and thousands of deaths every year. Up until that point, trans fats enjoyed their so-called “GRAS” status: “Generally Recognized As Safe.” How did these killer fats get labeled as safe? Who decides what’s safe? Currently, a “generally recognized as safe” determination is made when the manufacturer of a food substance evaluates the safety of the substance themselves and concludes that the use of the substance is safe. In other words, the company that manufactures the substance gets to determine if it is safe or not. This approach is commonly referred to as ”GRAS self-determination.” To make matters worse, not only do companies not have to inform the public, they don’t even have to inform the FDA. A company may voluntarily tell the FDA they just came up with a new food additive that they’ve decided is safe, but are not required to do so. The cumulative result is that there are an estimated 6,000 current affirmative safety decisions which allow for more than an estimated 10,000 substances to be used in food (See Who Determines if Food Additives are Safe?). In addition, an estimated 1,000 manufacturer safety decisions are never reported to FDA or the public. “Manufacturers and a trade association made the remaining decisions without FDA review by concluding on their own that the substances that they themselves were selling were safe.” While manufacturers are not required to notify the FDA of a “safe determination,” sometimes they do voluntarily notify the agency. From these notifications, researchers have been able to see which individuals companies select to make these determinations. Of the 451 GRAS notifications voluntarily submitted to the FDA, 22.4% were made by someone directly employed by the company; 13.3% were made by someone directly employed by a firm hand-picked by the company; and 64.3% were made by a panel hand-picked by the corporation or the firm the corporation hired. Are you doing the math? Yes, that means zero safety decisions were made independently. An astonishing 100% of the members of expert panels worked directly or indirectly for the companies that manufactured the food additive in question. And those are just the ones the food companies let the FDA know about. The companies also used the same in-the-pocket rent-a-scientist “experts” over and over, leading food industry watchdog Marion Nestle to ask “How is it possible that the FDA permits manufacturers to decide for themselves whether their food additives are safe?” It may be because many of the companies providing our daily food are corporate giants with “political muscles that national governments would envy.” PepsiCo alone spent more than $9 million in a single year to lobby Congress. The fact that food additives like trans fats have been allowed to kill thousands of Americans year after year comes as less of a surprise to those who realize that “three of Washington’s largest lobbying firms reportedly now work for the food industry.” I’ve got three dozen videos on food additives. Here are a few highlights: Artificial Colors: Phosphates: Preservatives: Sweeteners: Others: Just as the food additive industry gets to decide which food additives are safe, the food industry holds sway over which foods are considered safe. See, for example, my video The McGovern Report. 	-	cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,FDA,heart disease,heart health,industry influence,Marion Nestle,mortality,Pepsi,processed foods,safety limits,trans fats,USDA	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-determines-if-food-additives-are-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-determines-if-food-additives-are-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2011.00166.x/abstract,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23925569,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16480546,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23410611,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/food-additives,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23925593,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-198	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/17/meat-industry-wins-right-to-sell-tainted-meat/	Meat Industry Wins Right to Sell Tainted Meat	In my last post, I talked about a particularly virulent strand of Salmonella traced to Foster Farms. But while even Mexico banned the importation of Foster Farms’ chicken on public health grounds, it was still sold in the United States. Why wasn’t there a recall? How could Foster Farms continue to legally sell chicken contaminated with this virulent strain of Salmonella? It all goes back to Supreme Beef v. USDA, a court case in which the meat industry sued the USDA after they had the audacity to try to shut down a slaughter plant that was repeatedly found violating Salmonella standards. The meat industry won. The Federal Appeals Court ruled that it wasn’t illegal to sell contaminated meat; what was illegal was the USDA trying to protect the public by shutting down the plant. Because normal cooking practices destroy Salmonella, the presence of Salmonella in meat does not render the meat “injurious to health.” Salmonella-infected meat is thus legal to sell to the consumer. We can get infected no matter how well the meat is cooked though. According to researchers, even though consumers “may eliminate Salmonella on ready-to-cook chicken by proper cooking, they could still be exposed to and acquire a Salmonella infection from cross-contamination of other foods with Salmonella from raw chicken during meal preparation.” If we measure the transfer rate from naturally contaminated poultry legs purchased in supermarkets to cutting boards in the kitchen, overall, 80% of the leg skins in contact with the cutting board for ten minutes transferred Campylobacter (another dangerous bacteria found in chicken feces) infection to the cutting board. And then if we put cooked chicken back on that same cutting board, there’s about a 30% chance it too will become contaminated. Even though people know that washing hands can decrease the risk of food poisoning, only about 2/3 say they actually do it. Even though most people know about cross contamination, 1/3 don’t even say they wash their cutting boards. Though awareness appears to be growing, even when people wash the cutting boards with hot soapy water we can still find Salmonella and Campylobacter (see Avoiding Chicken to Avoid Bladder Infections). The reason most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen than their bathroom is because people rinse their chickens in the sink, not the toilet . Foster Farms swore they’d try to reduce the number of chickens they were producing with this virulent strain of Salmonella from 1 in 4 to just 1 in 20. Why not a zero tolerance policy in countries such as Sweden? Because then, as the head of food safety for Costco noted, “you wouldn’t have a poultry industry.” Other countries have been able to raise chickens without Salmonella. One industry-funded scientist complained that if the entire onus to produce safe products is placed on industry, “it then gives the consumer no personal responsibility to handle their product correctly.” That’s like a car company saying we can’t make safe cars because then no one will wear a seat belt. I’ve touched on this topic before in my videos Salmonella in Chicken and Turkey Deadly but Not Illegal, Zero Tolerance to Acceptable Risk, and Unsafe at Any Feed. More on the issue of cross-contamination in: Note when it comes to egg-borne infection the issue is not just cross-contamination, given Salmonella can survive the most common egg cooking methods. Check out my video Total Recall. Though some meat additives may make meat safer (Viral Meat Spray and Maggot Meat Spray), others may increase the food safety risk. See my video Phosphate Additives in Chicken. 	-	campylobacter,chicken,Cooking methods,cooking temperature,farm animals,fecal bacteria,fecal contamination,food poisoning,food recalls,foodborne illness,industry influence,Mexico,poultry,safety limits,Sweden,turkey,USDA	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zero-tolerance-to-acceptable-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587707,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20051196,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9830117,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23317854,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://www.care2.com/greenliving/foster-farms-chicken-salmonella-outbreaks.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zero-tolerance-to-acceptable-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://openjurist.org/391/f3d/629/in-the-matter-of-supreme-beef-processors-inc-v-department-of-agriculture,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10463448,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.fosterfarms.com/about/press/press_release.asp?press_release_id=160	
A-199	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/12/chicken-salmonella-outbreaks-show-food-safety-systems-failure/	Chicken Salmonella Outbreaks Show Food Safety Systems Failure	Salmonella causes more hospitalizations and more deaths than any other foodborne illness, and it’s been on the rise. Salmonella causes a million cases of food poisoning every year in the U.S., and over the last decade or so the number of cases has increased by 44%, particularly among children and the elderly. And chicken is the number one cause of Salmonella poisoning. Starting in Spring 2012, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) documented more than 600 individuals infected across 29 states with a particularly virulent strain of Salmonella (one in three were hospitalized). Investigations pointed to Foster Farms—the sixth largest chicken producer in the US—as the most likely source of the outbreak. The CDC warned people, but nothing was done. Foster Farms apparently continued to pump out contaminated meat for 17 months. Though there’s only been a few hundred cases confirmed, for every confirmed case the CDC estimates 38 cases slip through the cracks. So Foster Farms chicken may have infected and sickened more than 15,000 people. When USDA inspectors went to investigate, they found 25% of the chicken they sampled was contaminated with the outbreak strain of Salmonella, presumed to be because of all the fecal matter they found on the carcasses. In their February 2014 issue, Consumer Reports published a study on the high cost of cheap chicken, finding 97% of retail chicken breast off store shelves was contaminated with bacteria that can make people sick. 38% of the salmonella they found was resistant to multiple antibiotics (considered a serious public health threat by the CDC). Consumer Reports suggested the cramped conditions on factory chicken farms may play a role, and indeed new research shows the stress of overcrowding can increase Salmonella invasion. The Pew Commission released a special report on the Foster Farms outbreaks, concluding that the outbreaks bring into sharp focus the ineffectiveness of USDA’s approach to minimizing Salmonella contamination in poultry products. The agency’s response “was inadequate to protect public health,” and to this day thousands of people are getting sick with this preventable foodborne illnesses. One of the Pew Commission’s recommendations is to close facilities that are failing to produce safe food and keep them closed until their products stop sending people to the hospital. What did Foster Farms have to say for itself? They said that their chicken was “safe to eat,” that there’s “no recall in effect,” and that it is “Grade A wholesome.” In the same breath, though, they say Salmonella on chicken happens all the time. Their chicken is “Grade A wholesome,” but might kill us if we don’t handle it right. (See Foster Farms Responds to Chicken Salmonella Outbreak). As outspoken food safety advocate Bill Marler put it, the poultry industry’s reaction to the presence of fecal contamination on chicken is that… sh*t happens. Salmonella contamination is also a problem in the U.S. egg supply, sickening more than 100,000 people every year. See my video Total Recall. Other pathogens in meat include Yersinia enterocolitica in pork (Yersinia in Pork), Staphylococcus (U.S. Meat Supply Flying at Half Staph), MRSA (MRSA in U.S. Retail Meat), Hepatitis E (Hepatitis E Virus in Pork), bladder-infecting E coli (Avoiding Chicken To Avoid Bladder Infections), Clostridium difficile (Toxic Megacolon Superbug), and Campylobacter, the most common bacterial chicken pathogen (Poultry and Paralysis). Poultry appears to cause the most outbreaks, but is all chicken to blame equally? See my video Superbugs in Conventional vs. Organic Chicken. How was it legal for Foster Farms to continue to ship our meat known to be contaminated with a dangerous pathogen? See my videos Why is selling Salmonella tainted chicken still legal? and Chicken Salmonella Thanks to Meat Industry Lawsuit. 	-	antibiotics,CDC,Center for Science in the Public Interest,chicken,children,Consumers Union,elderly,factory farming practices,fecal bacteria,fecal contamination,food poisoning,foodborne illness,industry influence,meat,mortality,Pew Commission,poultry,salmonella,turkey,USDA	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/10/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/01/why-is-selling-salmonella-tainted-chicken-still-legal/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/u-s-meat-supply-flying-at-half-staph/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-in-u-s-retail-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxic-megacolon-superbug/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superbugs-in-conventional-vs-organic-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hepatitis-e-virus-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foster-farms-responds-to-chicken-salmonella-outbreaks/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/u-s-meat-supply-flying-at-half-staph/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/10/chicken-salmonella-thanks-to-meat-industry-lawsuit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-in-u-s-retail-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxic-megacolon-superbug/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superbugs-in-conventional-vs-organic-chicken/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22980013,http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6227a3.htm,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hepatitis-e-virus-in-pork/,http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/02/the-high-cost-of-cheap-chicken/index.htm,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/01/why-is-selling-salmonella-tainted-chicken-still-legal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foster-farms-responds-to-chicken-salmonella-outbreaks/,http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/suppl_5/S488.short,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15095181,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24350836,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://www.marlerblog.com/files/2013/10/foster-farms-est-6137a-p1.pdf,http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/0001/01/01/weaknesses-in-fsiss-salmonella-regulation,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.fosterfarms.com/about/press/press_release.asp?press_release_id=160	
A-200	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/10/viral-food-poisoning-from-pesticides/	Viral Food Poisoning from Pesticides?	Although the most serious causes of food poisoning like Salmonella come largely from animal products (for example, most foodborne-related deaths have been attributed to poultry), millions of Americans are sickened by produce every year, thanks to noroviruses. Noroviruses can spread person-to-person via the fecal-oral route or by the ingestion of aerosolized vomit, which together may explain most norovirus food outbreaks. But a substantial proportion remained unexplained. How else can fecal viruses get on our fruits and veggies? The pesticide industry may be spraying them on (See Norovirus Food Poisoning from Pesticides). The water that’s used to spray pesticides on crops may be dredged up from ponds contaminated with fecal pathogens. When you hear of people getting infected with a stomach bug like E. coli from something like spinach, it’s important to realize that the pathogen didn’t originate from the spinach. Intestinal bugs come from intestines. Greens don’t have guts; plants don’t poop. “The application of pesticides may therefore not only be a chemical hazard, but also a microbiological hazard for public health.” What is the industry’s solution? To add more chemicals! “The inclusion of antiviral substances in reconstituted pesticides,” researchers assert, “may be appropriate to reduce the virological health risk posed by the application of pesticides.” Or we could just choose organic. Likewise the Salmonella in alfalfa sprout seeds (See Don’t Eat Raw Alfalfa Sprouts) likely came from manure run-off or contaminated irrigation water. But this pesticide angle adds a whole new route for fecal pathogens to pollute produce. Broccoli Sprouts are safer, and organic sprouts may therefore be safer still (See Broccoli Sprouts). Organic foods may also be healthier (see Cancer Fighting Berries) and don’t carry the potential chemical hazards associated with pesticides.

A-201	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/05/the-reversal-on-fish-oil/	The Reversal on Fish Oil	Are the purported benefits of fish oil supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a “fish tale“? Thanks to recommendations from organizations such as the American Heart Association that individuals at high risk for heart disease ask their physicians about fish oil supplementation, fish oil has grown into a multibillion dollar industry. We now consume over 100,000 tons of fish oil every year. But what does the science say? A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, highlighted in my video Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil? looked at all the best “randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3’s on lifespan, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke.” The studies told the subjects to either eat more oily fish or to take fish oil capsules. What did the study find? Overall, the researchers found no protective benefit for all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke. What about for those who already had a heart attack and are trying to prevent another? Still no benefit. Where did we even get this idea that omega 3’s were good for the heart? If we look at some of the older studies, the results seemed promising. For example, there was the famous DART trial back in the 80s involving 2,000 men. Those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29% reduction in mortality. Pretty impressive—no wonder it got a lot of attention. But people seemed to have forgotten the sequel, the DART-2 trial. The same group of researchers, and an even bigger study (3,000 men). In DART-2 “those advised to eat oily fish and particularly those supplied with fish oil capsules had a higher risk of cardiac death.” Put all the studies together, and there’s no justification for the use of omega 3s as a structured intervention in everyday clinical practice or for guidelines supporting more dietary omega-3’s. So what should doctors say when their patients follow the American Heart Association advice to ask them about fish oil supplements? Given this and other negative meta-analyses, “our job as doctors should be to stop highly marketed fish oil supplementation in all of our patients.” I’ve previously discussed fish oil supplements in the context of risks versus purported cardiovascular benefits: But if the benefits aren’t there, then all one is left with are concerns over the industrial pollutants that concentrate in the fish fat (even in distilled fish oil, see Is Distilled Fish Oil Toxin-Free?). These same contaminants are found in the fish themselves. This raises concern for adults (Fish Fog), children (Nerves of Mercury), and pregnant moms: 	-	American Heart Association,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,DHA,fat,fish,fish oil,heart disease,heart health,industry influence,lifespan,medical profession,men's health,mortality,nutrition myths,oils,omega-3 fatty acids,seafood,stroke,supplements	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dha/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nerves-of-mercury/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-fog/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493410,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nerves-of-mercury/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247954,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12571649,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24090562,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22968891,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12588785,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493407,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2571009,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fish-fog/	
A-202	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/03/introducing-joseph-gonzales-r-d/	Introducing Joseph Gonzales, R.D.	First, I want to thank all those that applied for the Nutrition Director position. I am so thrilled my work attracts such talented folks! We received dozens of applications from doctors and nurses and dietitians who dedicated days of their lives slogging through a grueling application process all for the honor of serving you. And that honor goes to Joseph Gonzales, R.D. Let me turn it over to him so he can introduce himself: Hello everyone!   I am so thrilled to join the team. It’s always been a passion of mine to help others. Let me tell you a little about my background:   Professionally, I started working as the Health Coordinator for Head Start – a federal program providing early childhood education, health, and nutrition for children. To focus on more nutrition-related efforts, I took a position in Washington, D.C., as Staff Dietitian with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM). There, I helped organize their Food for Life Programs, where certified instructors teach cooking classes dedicated to nutrition education for disease prevention. I also helped coordinate and publish clinical research studies, working closely with research study participants for nearly 4 years. I left the Physicians Committee to pursue medical school but took a detour and ended up working with the University of Texas – MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Integrative Medicine Program, specifically, as a dietitian in a comprehensive lifestyle study for women with breast cancer. It’s been a privilege to work alongside such courageous women.   My passion for both nutrition and helping others is perhaps best exemplified by my volunteer work in the Marshall Islands. I served at the Diabetes Wellness Center with the Director of Nutrition, Brenda Davis, R.D., helping people to control (and in some cases even reverse) type 2 diabetes with dietary changes. For years, I have witnessed the power of eating healthy in my own life, and through the lives of many friends, family, and research study participants. As NutritionFacts.org Nutrition Director, my hope is to forward the mission of making advances in the field freely available and accessible to all by helping people wherever they are at with improving their diets.   I may not have all the answers to your questions, but I can help find them for you. Please leave a question in the comments section under any of the videos or blogs and I’ll do my best to help.   Sincerely, Joseph Gonzales, R.D.

A-203	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/26/are-multivitamins-just-a-waste-of-money/	Are Multivitamins Just a Waste of Money?	About one in three Americans take a multivitamin. Is that helpful, harmful, or just a harmless waste of money? In 2011, the Iowa Women’s Health Study reported that multivitamin use was associated with a higher risk of total mortality, meaning that women who took a multivitamin appeared to be paying to live shorter lives. But this was just an observational study—researchers didn’t split women up into two groups and put half on multivitamins to see who lived longer. All they did was follow a large population of women over time, and found that those that happened to be taking multivitamins were more likely to die. But maybe they were taking multivitamins because they were sick. The researchers didn’t find any evidence of that, but ideally we’d have a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, where thousands were followed for over a decade, with half given a multivitamin and half a placebo. That’s what we got the following year in 2012 with the Harvard Physicians’ Study II. And after a decade, the researchers found no effect on heart attack, stroke, or mortality. The accompanying editorial concluded that multivitamins are a distraction from effective cardiovascular disease prevention. The message needs to remain simple and focused: heart disease can be largely prevented by healthy lifestyle changes. The researchers did, however, find that for men with a history of cancer, the multivitamin appeared to be protective against getting cancer again, though there was no significant difference in cancer mortality or cancer protection in those who’ve never had cancer before. Still, that’s pretty exciting. It is just one study, though. Ideally we’d have maybe 20 of these placebo-controlled trials and then compile all the results together. That’s what we got in 2013—a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that analyzed twenty-one trials and more than 90,000 individuals. The analysis found no influence on mortality either way. Some found more cancer mortality, some found less cancer mortality, but all in all it was a wash. And that was heralded as good news. After the Iowa Women’s Health Study came out we were worried multivitamins could be harming millions of people, but instead they don’t appear to have much effect either way. The accompanying editorial asked whether meta-analyses trump observational studies. The Iowa Women’s Health Study followed tens of thousands of women for nearly 20 years. What if we put all the studies together, the big observational studies along with the experimental trials? And that’s what we got in December 2013. The review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, highlighted in my video, Should We Take a Multivitamin? found that multivitamins appear to offer no consistent evidence of benefit for heart disease, cancer, or living longer. But aren’t vitamins and minerals good for us? One explanation for this result could be that our bodies are so complex that the effects of supplementing with only one or two components is generally ineffective or actually does harm. Maybe we should get our nutrients in the way nature intended, in food. The accompanying editorial to the December 2013 review concluded that enough is enough. We should stop wasting our money on vitamin and mineral supplements. Americans spend billions on vitamin and mineral supplements. A better investment in health would be eating more fruits and vegetables. Imagine if instead we spent those billions on broccoli? I’ve previously addressed multivitamins in my videos Are Multivitamins Good For You? and Multivitamin Supplements and Breast Cancer (with a follow-up in my Q&A Is multivitamin use really associated to an increased risk of breast cancer?). I also touched on potential risks in Dietary Theory of Alzheimer’s. With the exception of vitamins D and B12 (Vitamin Supplements Worth Taking), we should strive to get our nutrients from produce, not pills. What about fish oil supplements?

A-204	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/24/understanding-lifestyle-medicine-from-the-heart/	Understanding Lifestyle Medicine From the Heart	I talk a lot about numbers and statistics, but as the Director of Yale’s Prevention Research Center Dr. David Katz put it in an editorial in the American Journal of Health Promotion, to reach doctors, our fellow colleagues, maybe we need to “put a human face on it all.” We have known, for at least a decade that the “leading causes of both premature death and persistent misery in our society are chronic diseases that are, in turn, attributable to the use of our feet (exercise), forks (diet), and fingers (cigarette smoking). Feet, forks, and fingers are the master levels of medical destiny for not just thousands of people on any one occasion but the medical destiny of millions upon millions year after year.” We as doctors, as a medical profession have known—Ornish published his landmark study 25 years ago (See Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped). “We have known, but we have not managed to care,” writes Dr. Katz. “At least not care deeply enough to turn what we know into what we routinely do.” Were we to do so, we might be able to eliminate most heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and cancer. But saving millions of lives is just a number. He asks doctors to: “forget the bland statistics of public health, and ask yourself if you love someone who has suffered a heart attack, stroke, cancer, or diabetes….Now imagine their faces, whisper their names. Recall what it felt like to get the news. And while at it, imagine the faces of others like you and me imagining beloved faces. Now imagine if eight out of ten of us wistfully reflecting on intimate love and loss, on personal anguish, never got that dreadful news because it never happened. Mom did not get cancer; dad did not have a heart attack; grandpa did not have a stroke; sister, brother, aunt, and uncle did not lose a limb or kidney or eyes to diabetes. We are all intimately linked, in a network of personal tragedy that need never have occurred.” Which leads to what he is asking doctors to do about it: put a face on public health every chance you get. “When talking about heart disease and its prevention—or cancer or diabetes—ask your audience to see in their mind’s eye the face of a loved one affected by that condition. Then imagine that loved one among the 80% who need never have succumbed if what we knew as doctors were what we do.” “Invoke the mind’s eye,” he advises, and “then bring a tear to it.” (See Convincing Doctors to Embrace Lifestyle Medicine). I think I’ve only profiled one other editorial (Ornish’s Convergence of Evidence), but this one really struck me, so much so I used it to close out my live presentation, More Than an Apple a Day: Combating Common Diseases. Why don’t more doctors practice lifestyle medicine? Two theories are offered in The Tomato Effect and Lifestyle Medicine: Treating the Causes of Disease.

A-205	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/19/dont-forget-fiber/	Don't Forget Fiber	The famous surgeon Denis Burkitt is better known for his discovery of a childhood cancer now known as Burkitt’s lymphoma than for his 1979 international bestseller, Don’t Forget the Fibre in Your Diet. Anyone asked to list the twenty or more most important advances in health made in the last few decades would be likely to include none of what Dr. Burkitt considered to be among the most significant. What was the number one most important advance in health according to one of the most famous medical figures of the 20th century? The discovery that “Many of the major and commonest diseases in modern Western culture are universally rare in third-world communities, were uncommon even in the United States until after World War l” yet are now common in anyone following the Western lifestyle. So it’s not genetics—they’re lifestyle diseases (See Dr. Burkitt’s F-Word Diet). This means they must potentially be preventable. Those eating the standard American diet have very high levels of a long list of diseases—such as heart disease and colon cancer—that were similar to the rates of disease in the ruling white class in apartheid Africa. Conversely, the rates in the Bantu population were very low. These native Africans ate the same three sister diets of many Native Americans, a plant-based diet centered around corn, beans, and squash. In fact, it was reported that cancer was so seldom seen in American Indians a century ago they were considered practically immune to cancer—and heart disease. What are “very low” rates? 1300 Bantus were autopsied over five years in a Bantu hospital and less than ten cases of ischemic heart disease, the West’s number one killer. The Bantu’s rates of heart and intestinal disease is similar to poor Indians, whereas wealthier Indians who ate more animal and refined foods were closer to those in Japan—unless they moved to the U.S. and started living like us. You find similar trends for the other so-called Western diseases, which Burkitt thought were related to the major dietary changes that followed the lndustrial Revolution: a reduction in healthy whole plant foods—the source of starch and fiber–and a great increase in consumption of animal fats, salt, and sugar. His theory was that it was the fiber. He believed all of these major diseases may be caused by a diet deficient in whole plant foods, the only natural source of fiber. Fiber? In a survey of 2,000 Americans, over 95% of graduate school-educated participants and health care providers weren’t even aware of the daily recommended fiber intake. Doctors don’t even know. How much fiber should we shoot for? The Institute of Medicine recommends 38 grams for men 50 years and younger and 30 grams for men over 50 years. Women 50 years and younger should get 25 and those older than 50 should get 21 grams. But these levels are just the minimum. I recommend we look to our evolutionary past for more clues on fiber intake. See my video Paleolithic Lessons. One analogy Dr. Burkitt used is this: “If a floor is flooded as a result of a dripping tap, it is of little use to mop up the floor unless the tap is turned off. The water from the tap represents the cause of disease, the flooded floor the diseases filling our hospital beds. Medical students learn far more about methods of floor mopping than about turning off taps, and doctors who are specialists in mops and brushes can earn infinitely more than those dedicated to shutting off taps.” And the drug companies are more than happy to sell us rolls of paper towels, so patients can buy a new roll every day for the rest of their lives. To paraphrase Ogden Nash: modern medicine is making great progress, but just headed in the wrong direction. How do we know that diet was the critical factor? Because when we place people stricken with these diseases on plant-based diets, their disease can be reversed (Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped). In fact it was the work of Burkitt and others in Africa that led to the disease reversal work of pioneers like Nathan Pritikin (Engineering a Cure).

A-206	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/17/organic-milk-and-prostate-cancer/	Organic Milk and Prostate Cancer	Researchers have expressed concern that since cow’s milk contains estrogens, dairy could stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors. The thought is that the consumption of dairy products could both “promote the conversion of precancerous lesions or mutated cells to invasive cancer and enhance the progression of hormone-dependent tumors.” This was initially postulated based on suggestive population-scale data like a 25 fold increase in prostate cancer in Japan since World War II. What was happening to their diets during that period? A 5, 10, and 20 fold increase in eggs, meat, and dairy consumption, respectively, whereas the rest of their diet remained pretty stable. But diet wasn’t the only major change in Japanese lifestyles over the latter half century. Similarly, even though countries with higher milk consumption tend to have more prostate cancer deaths and countries with lower milk consumption fewer deaths, there could be hundreds of confounding variables. But it certainly does spur interest in studying the possibility. A recent study from Clemson University represents the other extreme, controlling for as many factors as possible by isolating prostate cancer cells out of the body in a petri dish and dripping cow milk on them directly. The researchers chose organic cow’s milk, because they wanted to exclude the effect of added hormones so that they could test the effect of all the growth hormones and sex steroids found naturally in milk. They found that cow’s milk stimulated the growth of human prostate cancer cells in each of 14 separate experiments, producing an average increase in cancer growth rate of over 30%. In contrast, almond milk suppressed the growth of these cancer cells by over 30%. But just because something happens in a petri dish or a test tube doesn’t mean the same thing happens in a person. It’s just suggestive evidence that we can use in a grant application to get money to study actual people. This can be done with a retrospective (looking backward) study where we take prostate cancer patients and figure out what they ate in the past, or a prospective (looking forward) study where we look at people’s diets first and follow them for a few years and see who gets cancer. The looking back kind are typically referred to as case-control studies, because researchers look at cases of cancer and compare their diets to controls. The looking forward kind are often called cohort studies because a cohort of people is followed forward. Then, if we want to get fancy, we can do a so-called meta-analysis, where you combine all the best studies done to date and see what the balance of available evidence shows. The latest meta-analysis of all the best case control studies ever done on the matter concludes that milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer. And the latest meta-analysis of all the best cohort studies ever done also concludes that milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer. An even newer study profiled in my video, Prostate Cancer and Organic Milk vs. Almond Milk, suggests that milk intake during adolescence may be particularly risky in terms of potentially setting one up for cancer later in life. Despite hormone-related cancers being among our top killers, as pointed out in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, “we simply do not know which hormones, and how much, are in the food that we ingest. More effort has been directed at the investigation of illicit use of designer steroids by Olympians and ballplayers than to the investigation of the effect of dietary hormones on cancer and other diseases that affect millions.” A proposal is therefore made to monitor levels of steroid and other hormones and growth factors in all dairy and meat-containing foods, though to date this has not been done. I touched previously on the prostate cancer data in one of my oldest videos, Slowing the Growth of Cancer. Other factors may play into the link between cancer and dairy consumption including industrial pollutants (Industrial Carcinogens in Animal Fat) and IGF-1 (How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?), but for more on the hormones in dairy see: What about all the studies suggesting milk “does a body good”?

A-207	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/12/who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin/	Who Should be Careful About Curcumin?	Following flax and wheatgrass, turmeric is the third best-selling botanical dietary supplement, racking up $12 million in sales. Currently, sales are increasing at a rate of 20%. “Curcumin is a natural plant product extracted from the turmeric root and is used commonly as a food additive popular for its pleasant mild aroma and exotic yellow color.  It is widely considered unlikely to cause side effects.” However, just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s not toxic. Strychnine is natural; cyanide is natural. Lead, mercury and plutonium are all elements—can’t get more natural than that! But turmeric is just a plant. Surely plants can’t be dangerous? Tell that to Socrates. “In considering the validity of the widely accepted notion that complementary and alternative medicine is a safer approach to therapy, we must remind ourselves and our patients that a therapy that exerts a biologic effect is, by definition, a drug and can have toxicity.” It cannot be assumed that diet-derived agents will be innocuous when administered as pharmaceutical formulations at doses likely to exceed those consumed in the diet. Traditional Indian diets may include as much as a teaspoon of turmeric a day. Doses of turmeric that have been used in human studies range from less than just a 16th of a teaspoon a day to two tablespoons a day for over a month. On the other hand, the curcumin trials have used up to the amount found in cups of the spice, around 100 times more than what curry lovers have been eating for centuries. Studies have yet to show overt serious side effects in the short-term. However, if we combine high dose curcumin with black pepper, resulting in a 2000% boost in bioavailability (See Boosting the Bioavailability of Curcumin), it could be like consuming the equivalent of 29 cups of turmeric a day. That kind of intake could bring peak blood levels to the range where you start seeing some significant DNA damage in vitro. So just incorporating turmeric into your cooking may be better than taking curcumin supplements, especially during pregnancy. The only other contraindication cited in the most recent review on curcumin was the potential to trigger gallbladder pain in individuals with gallstones. If anything, curcumin may help protect liver function and help prevent gallstones by acting as a cholecystokinetic agent, meaning that it facilitates the pumping action of the gallbladder to keep the bile from stagnating. In one study, profiled in my video, Who Shouldn’t Consume Turmeric or Curcmin?, researchers gave people a small dose of curcumin, about the amount found in a quarter teaspoon of turmeric and, using ultrasound, were able to visualize the gallbladder squeezing down in response, with an average change in volume of about 29%. Optimally, though we want to squeeze it in half. So the researchers repeated the experiment with different doses. It took about 40 milligrams to get a 50% contraction, or about a third of a teaspoon of turmeric every day. On one hand that’s great—totally doable. On the other hand, that’s some incredibly powerful stuff! What if you had a gallbladder obstruction? What if you had a stone blocking your bile duct? If you eat something that makes your gallbladder squeeze so much, it could cause pain. So patients with biliary tract obstruction should be careful about consuming curcumin. For everyone else, these results suggest that curcumin can effectively “induce the gallbladder to empty and thereby reduce the risk of gallstone formation and ultimately even gallbladder cancer.” Too much turmeric, though, may increase the risk of kidney stones. As I mentioned in Oxalates in Cinnamon, turmeric is high in soluble oxalates which can bind to calcium and form insoluble calcium oxalate, which is responsible for approximately 75% of all kidney stones. “The consumption of even moderate amounts of turmeric would therefore not be recommended for people with a tendency to form kidney stones.” Such folks should restrict the consumption of total dietary oxalate to less than 40 to 50 mg/day, which means no more than at most a teaspoon of turmeric. Those with gout, for example, are by definition, it appears, at high risk for kidney stones, and so if their doctor wanted to treat gout inflammation with high dose turmeric, he or she might consider curcumin supplements, because to reach high levels of curcumin in turmeric form would incur too much of an oxalate load. If we are going to take a supplement, how do we choose? The latest review recommends purchasing from Western suppliers that follow recommended Good Manufacturing Practices, which may decrease the likelihood of buying an adulterated product. I previously discussed the role spices play in squelching inflammation and free radicals in Which Spices Fight Inflammation? and Spicing Up DNA Protection. Then out of the lab into the clinic with attempts to test the ability of turmeric extracts to treat joint inflammation with Turmeric Curcumin and Rheumatoid Arthritis and Turmeric Curcumin and Osteoarthritis. I wish there was more science on wheatgrass. I just had that one unhelpful anecdote in my video How Much Broccoli Is Too Much? There is good science on flax though. See: More on gallbladder health can be found in my video Cholesterol Gallstones. And those who are susceptible to kidney stones should try to alkalinize their urine by eating lots of dark green leafy vegetables. See Testing Your Diet with Pee & Purple Cabbage. Based on this new science on turmeric (lots more to come!), I now try to include it in my family’s daily diet. 	-	alternative medicine,bladder cancer,bladder disease,bladder health,calcium,cancer,complementary medicine,curcumin,DNA damage,flax seeds,gallbladder disease,gallbladder health,gallstones,gout,heavy metals,India,kidney disease,kidney function,kidney health,kidney stones,lead,liver disease,liver health,medications,mercury,oxalates,plutonium,pregnancy,safety limits,side effects,spices,supplements,turmeric	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/liver-health/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-gallstones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-broccoli-is-too-much/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492273,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17900536,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-broccoli-is-too-much/,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ibd.20229/full,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10102956,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23594449,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12087559,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-gallstones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19721899

A-209	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/05/why-pepper-boosts-turmeric-blood-levels/	Why Pepper Boosts Turmeric Blood Levels	“Historians from all around the world have produced evidence to show that apparently all primitive peoples used herbs-often in a sophisticated way. Quinine from Cinchona bark was used to treat the symptoms of malaria long before the disease was identified, and the raw ingredients of a common aspirin tablet have been a popular painkiller for far longer than we have had access to tablet-making machinery. Indeed, today many pharmacological classes of drugs include a natural product prototype that we originally discovered through the study of traditional cures and folk knowledge of indigenous people.” There’s a plant in South Asia called Adhatoda (from adu meaning “goat,” and thoda meaning “not touch” because it’s so bitter even the goats won’t eat it). It has compounds that help open one’s airways and as such, Adhatoda tea has been used traditionally to treat asthma, where the leaves are steeped with black peppercorns. Leaves steeped with black peppercorns? That sounds gross to me—why would they do that? Because they’re smart. Back in 1928, scientists discovered what the people evidently already knew, that adding pepper increased the anti-asthmatic properties of the leaves. Black pepper alone didn’t work: it was the combination. And now we know why. Just like approximately 5% of the spice turmeric is composed of an active compound called curcumin, about 5% of black pepper by weight is comprised of this compound called piperine. Curcumin is responsible for the yellow color of turmeric and piperine for the pungent flavor of pepper. Piperine is a potent inhibitor of drug metabolism. One of the ways our liver gets rid of foreign substances is making them water soluble so they can be more easily excreted. But this black pepper molecule inhibits that process. And it doesn’t take much. If people are given a bunch of turmeric curcumin, within an hour there’s a little bump in the level in their blood stream. We don’t see a large increase because our liver is actively trying to get rid of it. But what if the process is suppressed by taking just a quarter teaspoon’s worth of black pepper? Then you see curcumin levels skyrocket (See Boosting the Bioavailability of Curcumin). The same amount of curcumin consumed, but the bioavailability shoots up 2000%. Even just a little pinch of pepper—1/20th of a teaspoon—can significantly boost levels. And guess what a common ingredient in curry powder is besides turmeric? Black pepper. Another way to boost the absorption of curcumin is to consume it in the whole food, turmeric root (fresh or dried as a powder) because natural oils found in turmeric root and turmeric powder can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin seven to eight fold. When eaten with fat, curcumin can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream through the lymphatic system thereby in part bypassing the liver. How is it prepared in India? With fat and black pepper. Amazing how they could figure that out without double blind trials. (Though maybe it just tastes good, and it’s merely coincidence?) Their traditional knowledge certainly failed them with ghee, however, which is practically pure butter fat, which may explain India’s relatively high rates of heart disease despite all their turmeric. Why would we care about boosting curcumin levels? Learn why in my videos Which Spices Fight Inflammation? and Spicing Up DNA Protection, Turmeric Curcumin and Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Turmeric Curcumin and Osteoarthritis. It’s also good to know Who Shouldn’t Consume Curcumin or Turmeric. I’ve previously covered this topic of food synergy in videos such as Apples and Oranges: Dietary Diversity and Garden Variety Anti-Inflammation that emphasize the importance of eating a variety of plant foods to take advantage of some of these interactions. The black pepper mechanism reminds me of the grapefruit (Tell Your Doctor If You Eat Grapefruit) and broccoli (The Best Detox) stories. A testament to the power of plants. The painkilling properties of aspirin mentioned in the video are actually found throughout the plant kingdom: Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods. In some circumstances, traditional medicine wisdom seems incredible (Tomato Effect); in others, dangerous (Get the Lead Out).

A-210	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/03/foods-that-fight-osteoarthritis-inflammation/	Foods That Fight Osteoarthritis & Inflammation	Osteoarthritis is the most frequent cause of physical disability among older adults in the world, affecting more than 20 million Americans. It is estimated that 20% of us will be affected in the coming decades and it is becoming more and more widespread among younger people. Can anti-inflammatory foods help with this disease? Osteoarthritis is characterized by loss of cartilage in the joint. We used to think it was just mechanical wear and tear, but is “now generally accepted to be an active joint disease with a prominent inflammatory component.” This is supported by the fact that, for example, there is significantly higher production of inflammatory prostaglandins from tissue samples obtained from the knees of people suffering from the disease. If the loss of cartilage is caused by inflammation, an anti-inflammatory diet may indeed help. A recent review concluded that using optimal nutrition and exercise as the “first-line” intervention in the management of chronic osteoarthritis could well constitute the best medical practice. What does “optimal nutrition” look like? The China study “showed the serious health consequences of high consumption of pro-inflammatory foods (meat, dairy, fat, and junk) and low consumption of anti-inflammatory plant foods (whole grains, vegetables and fruits, and beans, split peas, chickpeas and lentils).” The unnatural Western diet “contributes to low-grade systemic inflammation, and oxidative tissue stress and irritation, placing the immune system in an overactive state, a common denominator of conditions such as arthritis.” There are phytonutrients in plants that appear to help decrease the degradation of the joint cartilage, inflammatory activity, cell death and oxidative damage. This is based largely on in vitro studies, suggesting protective benefits of soy, pomegranates, citrus, grapes, green tea, and the curry powder spice turmeric. But my patients are people, not petri dishes. What role might the yellow pigment curcumin in turmeric play in the treatment of osteoarthritis? Obesity doesn’t just put more stress on our joints. The fatty tissue inside our joints—like in the kneecap itself—is a source of pro inflammatory chemicals that have been shown to increase cartilage degradation. Curcumin may not only help prevent the release of inflammatory chemicals, but may also slow the formation of the fat pad in the first place. But this has all been in test tubes. There have been two clinical studies published to date. The latest study took 50 patients suffering from mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis and gave them either the best available medical treatment, which included control with anti-inflammatory drugs and pain-killers, or the best available treatment along with some proprietary curcumin supplement. They looked at a number of different outcome measures, including the Karnofsky scale which goes up to 100 (normal, no evidence of disease), down to zero, at which you’re dead. The group with the added curcumin did significantly better, and were able to double their walking distance (see the results in my video, Turmeric Curcumin and Osteoarthritis). The curcumin group was also able to significantly decrease their drug use, side-effects, swelling hospitalizations, and other treatments. But it doesn’t have to be some fancy proprietary formula. In the other study, “The efficacy of turmeric extracts in patients with knee osteoarthritis,” about a hundred sufferers were randomized to ibuprofen or concentrated turmeric extracts for six weeks, and the curcumin group did as good or better than the ibuprofen group. Even though ibuprofen is over-the-counter, it can cause ulceration bleeding and perforation of the stomach and intestines (that is, it can eat right through your stomach wall). In fact, that happened to someone in the study. Whereas the side-effects of curcumin include potentially protecting against a long list of diseases. What about rheumatoid arthritis? See Turmeric Curcumin and Rheumatoid. Also check out Boosting the Bioavailability of Curcumin and Who Shouldn’t Consume Curcumin or Turmeric. I think the only other video I have on osteoarthritis is Rose Hips for Osteoarthritis. Those unfamiliar with The China Study should read it! I also mention it in my video China Study on Sudden Cardiac Death. If, as described, oxidative stress and inflammation both play a role in joint inflammation, then that may help explain the role of turmeric.

A-211	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/29/dr-greger-takes-on-mediterranean-diet-in-new-dvd/	Dr. Greger Takes on Mediterranean Diet in New DVD	The Mediterranean Diet is an “in” topic nowadays, in both the medical literature and the lay media. More than 450 papers were published in the medical literature during just the last year alone, more than one a day. As a recent commentary noted “Uncritical laudatory coverage is the common parlance. Specifics are hard to come by: what is it? what is its history? why is it good? Merits are rarely detailed; possible downsides are never mentioned.” I answer these questions and more in a 6-part video series: They are all available right now as a video download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 23 (all proceeds go to this charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD. The Mediterranean videos are all scheduled to go up on NutritionFacts.org by mid-March, but you can download and watch them right now. The current batch of videos from volume 22 on NutritionFacts.org just ran out, so starting next month and running through April, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 23. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–40+ hours of video–you can get the complete DVD collection. Here’s the list of chapters from the new volume 23 DVD — a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org: Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads.   If you were a regular supporter, you’d already be a Mediterranean diet expert by now, having gotten the new DVD last week! I now come out with DVDs every 9 weeks. If you’d like to automatically receive them before they’re even available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor. Anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both–your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs.

A-212	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/27/the-spice-that-helps-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain/	The Spice That Helps Ease Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain	According to the World Health Organization, “80% of the Earth’s inhabitants rely upon the traditional medicine for their primary health-care needs, in part due to high cost of Western pharmaceuticals. Medicines derived from plants have played a pivotal role in the health care of both ancient and modern cultures.” One of the prime sources of plant-derived medicines is spices. Turmeric, for example, has been consumed over the centuries around the world. Turmeric is known by different names in different societies—my favorite of which is probably “zard-choobag.” Turmeric is the dried powdered root stalks of the turmeric plant—a member of the ginger family—from which the orangey-yellow pigment curcumin can be extracted. The spice turmeric is what makes curry powder yellow, and curcumin is what makes turmeric yellow. In the video, Turmeric Curcumin and Rheumatoid Arthritis, you can see the molecular structure of curcumin. I always thought it kind of looked like a crab. In recent years, more than 5,000 articles have been published in the medical literature about curcumin. Many sport impressive looking diagrams suggesting curcumin can benefit a multitude of conditions via a dizzying array of mechanisms. Curcumin was first isolated more than a century ago, but out of the thousands of experiments, just a handful in the 20th century were clinical studies, involving actual human participants. Most of the 5,000 were just in vitro lab studies, which I’ve resisted covering until the studies moved out of the petri dish and into the person. But since the turn-of-the-century, more than 50 clinical trials have been done, testing curcumin against a variety of human diseases, with 84 more on the way. One such study got my attention. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that causes progressive destruction of the cartilage and bone of joints. The long-term prognosis of RA is poor, with as much as 80% of patients affected becoming disabled with a reduced life expectancy. There are lots of drugs one can take, but unfortunately they’re often associated with severe side effects including blood loss, bone loss and bone marrow suppression, and toxicity to the liver and eyes. The efficacy of curcumin was first demonstrated over 30 years ago in a double-blind crossover study: curcumin versus phenylbutazone, a powerful anti-inflammatory that is used in race horses. Both groups showed significant improvement in morning stiffness, walking time, and joint swelling, with the complete absence of any side effects from curcumin (which is more than can be said for phenylbutazone, which was pulled from the market three years later after wiping out people’s immune systems and their lives). In the new study, 45 patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized into three groups: curcumin, the standard of care drug, or both. The primary endpoint was a reduction in disease activity as well as a reduction in joint tenderness and swelling. All three groups got better, but interestingly the curcumin groups showed the highest percentage of improvement, significantly better than those in the drug group. The findings are significant and demonstrate that curcumin alone was not only safe and effective, but surprisingly more effective in alleviating pain compared to the leading drug of choice, all without any adverse side effects. In fact, curcumin appeared protective against drug side effects, given that there were more adverse reactions in the drug group than in the combined drug and curcumin group. In contrast to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), curcumin has no gastrointestinal side effects, and may even protect the lining of the stomach. Hard to appreciate the gorgeous color of fresh turmeric root unless you see it for yourself. You should be able to find it at any large Asian store. I incorporate it into my Natural Nausea Remedy Recipe. The inner color is almost fluorescent! I’m afraid followers of NutritionFacts.org are going to get sick of turmeric, but there’s a load of important new research I felt I needed to cover. So far there’s Turmeric Curcumin and Osteoarthritis, Boosting the Bioavailability of Curcumin and Who Shouldn’t Consume Curcumin or Turmeric? I’ve previously talked about treating autoimmune joint inflammation with diets full of plants in Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis and Potassium and Autoimmune Disease.

A-213	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/22/the-top-three-dna-protecting-spices/	The Top Three DNA Protecting Spices	In my video Which Spices Fight Inflammation? I profile a landmark study that compared the ability of different spices to suppress inflammation. The study also compared the spices’ ability to protect DNA. Cloves, ginger, rosemary, and turmeric were able to significantly stifle the inflammatory response, but can they also protect DNA? If a tissue sample is taken from a random person, about 7% of their cells may show evidence of DNA damage, actual breaks in the strands of their DNA. If we then blast those cells with free radicals, we can bring that number up to 10%. But if the person has been eating ginger for a week, DNA damage drops to just 8%. In the video, Spicing Up DNA Protection, you can see a comparison of DNA damage in cells from people eating different spices. Those who hadn’t been eating any herbs or spices were vulnerable to DNA damage from oxidative stress. But just including ginger in our diet may cut that damage by 25%—the same with rosemary. Turmeric is even more powerful—DNA damage was cut in half. And this was not just mixing turmeric with cells in some petri dish: This is comparing what happens when you expose the cells of spice eaters versus the cells of non-spice eaters to free radicals and count the DNA fracture rates. And not only did the turmeric work significantly better, but it did so at a significantly smaller dose. One and a third teaspoons a day of ginger or rosemary was compared to practically just a pinch of turmeric (about an eighth of a teaspoon a day)—that’s how powerful the stuff is. I encourage everyone to cook with this wonderful spice. It tastes great and may protect every cell in our body, with or without the added stress. Counting the DNA breaks in people’s cells before and after a week of spices without the free radical blast revealed no significant intrinsic protection in the ginger or rosemary groups. However, the turmeric still appeared to reduce DNA damage by half. This may be because curcumin is not just an antioxidant—it also boosts the activity of the body’s own antioxidant enzymes. Catalase is one of the most active enzymes in the body: each one can detoxify millions of free radicals per second. If we consume the equivalent of about three quarters of a teaspoon of turmeric a day, the activity of this enzyme in our bloodstream gets boosted by 75%! I suggest cooking with it rather than, for example, just throwing it in a smoothie. Why? Because this effect was found specifically for heat-treated turmeric. In practice, many herbs and spices are only consumed after cooking, so the researchers tested turmeric and oregano in both raw and cooked forms. In terms of DNA damage, the results from raw turmeric did not reach statistical significance. However, the opposite was found for its anti-inflammatory effects. So we might want to eat it both ways. “Practical recommendations for obtaining curcumin in the diet might be to add turmeric to sweet dishes containing cinnamon and ginger.” I add it to my pumpkin pie smoothies (a can of pumpkin, frozen cranberries, pitted dates, pumpkin pie spice and some nondairy milk). We can also cook with curry powder or turmeric itself. The researchers suggest something called “turmeric milk,” which is a traditional Indian elixir made with milk, turmeric powder, and sugar. I’d suggest substituting a healthier sweetener and a healthier milk. Soy milk, for example, might have a double benefit. If you’re taking turmeric to combat inflammation, osteoarthritis sufferers randomized to soy protein ended up with significantly improved joint range of motion compared to dairy protein. For some other extraordinary benefits of spices, see: There are a few herb and spice caveats. See, for example: Too much turmeric may also not be a good idea for those at risk for kidney stones (See Oxalates in Cinnamon).

A-214	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/20/the-top-four-anti-inflammatory-spices/	The Top Four Anti-Inflammatory Spices	Once in a while I come across a study that’s so juicy I have to do a whole video about it (Which Spices Fight Inflammation?). A group of researchers at the University of Florida, Gainesville and Pennsylvania State set up a brilliant experiment. We’ve known that ounce per ounce, herbs and spices have some of the greatest antioxidant activities known. But that’s only ever been tested in a test tube. Before we can ask if an herb or spice has real health benefits, it is first necessary to determine whether it is bioavailable — whether the active ingredients are even absorbed. This had never been done, until now. The researchers could have taken the easy route and just measured the change in antioxidant level in one’s bloodstream before and after consumption, but the assumption that the appearance of antioxidant activity in the blood is an indication of bioavailability has a weakness. Maybe more gets absorbed than we think but doesn’t show up on antioxidant tests because it gets bound up to proteins or cells. So the researchers attempted to measure physiological changes in the blood. They were interested in whether absorbed compounds would be able to protect white blood cells from an oxidative or inflammatory injury—whether herb and spice consumption would protect the strands of our DNA from breaking when attacked by free radicals. I cover the DNA findings in my video, Spicing Up DNA Protection. They also wondered if the consumption might alter cellular inflammatory responses in the presence of a physiologically relevant inflammatory insult. What does this all mean? The researchers took a bunch of people and had each of them eat different types of spices for a week. There were many truly unique things about this study, but one was that the quantity of spices that study subjects consumed was based on the usual levels of consumption in actual food. For example, the oregano group was given a half teaspoon a day—a practical quantity that people might actually eat once in a while. At the end of the week, they drew blood from the dozen or so people they had adding, for example, black pepper to their diets that week, and compared the effects of their blood to the effects of the blood of the dozen subjects on cayenne, or cinnamon, or cloves, or cumin. They had about ten different groups of people eating about ten different spices. Then they dripped their plasma (the liquid fraction of their blood) onto human white blood cells in a Petri dish that had been exposed to an inflammatory insult. The researchers wanted to pick something really inflammatory, so they chose oxidized cholesterol (which is what we’d get in our bloodstream after eating something like fried chicken. If oxidized cholesterol is a new concept for you, please check out its role in heart disease progression in my video Arterial Acne). So they jabbed the white blood cells with oxidized cholesterol and measured how much tumor necrosis factor (TNF) they produced in response. TNF is a powerful inflammatory cytokine, infamous for the role it plays in autoimmune attacks like inflammatory bowel disease. Compared to the blood of those who ate no spices for a week, black pepper was unable to significantly dampen the inflammatory response. What about any of the other spices? The following significantly stifled the inflammatory response: And remember, they weren’t dripping the spices themselves on these human white blood cells, but the blood of those who ate the spices. So the results represents what might happen when cells in our body are exposed to the levels of spices that circulate in our bloodstream after normal daily consumption—not megadoses in some pill. Just the amount that makes our spaghetti sauce, pumpkin pie, or curry sauce taste good. There are drugs that can do the same thing. Tumor necrosis factors are such major mediators of inflammation and inflammation-related diseases that there are TNF-blocking drugs on the market for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis, which collectively rake in more than $20 billion a year ($15,000–$20,000 per person per year). At that price, the side effects better be hugs and rainbows. But no, the drugs carry a so-called “black box warning” because they can cause things like cancer and heart failure. If only there was a cheaper, safer solution. The spice curcumin, the yellow pigment in turmeric, is substantially cheaper and safer, but does it work outside of a test tube? There’s evidence that it may help in all of the diseases for which TNF blockers are currently being used. So with health-care costs and safety being such major issues, this golden spice turmeric may help provide the solution. See Antioxidants in a Pinch and How to Reach the Antioxidant RDA to see the extent to which even small amounts of spices can affect one’s antioxidant intake. Another elegant series of “ex vivo” experiments exploring the cancer fighting power of lifestyle changes can be seen in the videos starting with Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay. Mushrooms (Boosting Immunity While Reducing Inflammation), nuts (Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell), and purple potatoes (Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Purple Potatoes) may also reduce inflammation (along with plant foods in general, see Anti-Inflammatory Antioxidants and Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods). In fact so well that plant-based diets can be used to treat inflammatory conditions. See, for example, Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease, Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Potassium and Autoimmune Disease. Animal products on the other hand may increase inflammation through a variety of mechanisms, including endotoxins (How Does Meat Cause Inflammation?), arachidonic acid (Chicken, Eggs, and Inflammation), and Neu5Gc (The Inflammatory Meat Molecule Neu5Gc). 	-	alternative medicine,ankylosing spondylitis,antioxidants,autoimmune diseases,cancer,cancer survival,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,Cayenne pepper,chicken,cholesterol,cinnamon,cloves,complementary medicine,cost savings,cumin,curcumin,DNA damage,ginger,heart disease,heart failure,heart health,herbs,inflammation,inflammatory bowel disease,medications,oregano,osteoarthritis,oxidative stress,pepper,poultry,psoriasis,rosemary,side effects,spices,Tumor necrosis factor,turmeric	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/why-meat-causes-inflammation/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspirin-levels-in-plant-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-and-autoimmune-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspirin-levels-in-plant-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/why-meat-causes-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378457,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/spicing-up-dna-protection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-and-autoimmune-disease/	
A-215	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/15/superbugs-on-retail-chicken/	Superbugs on Retail Chicken	One of the most concerning developments in medicine is the emergence of bacterial super-resistance—resistance not just to one class of drugs, like penicillin, but to multiple classes of drugs (so-called multi-drug resistance). In the 2013 Retail Meat Report, the FDA found that more than a quarter of the Salmonella contaminating retail chicken breast were resistant to not one but five or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs. Throughout history there has been a continual battle between humans and pathogens. For the last half century, this battle has taken the form of bugs versus drugs. When we developed penicillin, the U.S. Surgeon General declared, “The war against infectious diseases has been won.” However, the euphoria over the potential conquest of infectious diseases was short lived. In response to our offensive, bacteria developed an enzyme that ate penicillin for breakfast. In fact, bacteria can excrete such large quantities of the enzyme that they can destroy the drug before it even comes into contact. So we developed a drug that blocks the penicillin-eating enzyme. That’s why you may see two drug names on an antibiotic like Augmentin—one is the actual antibiotic (amoxicillin), and the other is a drug that blocks the enzyme the bacteria tries to use to block the antibiotic (clavulanate). But the bacteria outsmarted us again by developing a blocker blocking blocker—and so it goes back and forth. However hard we try and however clever we are, there is no question that organisms that have “been around for three billion years, and have adapted to survive under the most extreme conditions, will always overcome whatever we decide to throw at them.” So we went from first generation antibiotics, to second generation antibiotics, to third generation antibiotics. We now have bacteria that have evolved the capacity to survive our big-gun third generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, which is what we rely on to treat life-threatening Salmonella infections in children. Where are these super-duper-superbugs found? According to one study profiled in my video, Superbugs in Conventional vs. Organic Chicken, “almost 90% were isolated from chicken carcasses or retail chicken meat.” But what if we only ate antibiotic-free organic chicken? In the first such study ever published, researchers compared multidrug-resistant bacteria in organic and conventional retail chicken meat. All of the conventional chicken samples were contaminated; however, the majority (84%) of organic chicken meat samples was also contaminated. So 100% versus 84%. Organic is definitely better, but odds are we could still be buying something that could make our family sick. Where do these antibiotic resistant bacteria come from if organic producers are not using antibiotics? A possible explanation is that day-old chicks come from the hatcheries already infected with these bacteria before they arrive at the farms. Or, they could become contaminated after they leave the farm in the slaughter plant. Organic chickens and conventionally raised chickens are typically all slaughtered at the same plants, so there may be cross-contamination between carcasses. Finally, factory farms are dumping antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria-laden chicken manure out into the environment. Researchers can pick up antibiotic-resistant genes right out of the soil around factory farms. So even meat raised without antibiotics may be contaminated with multi-drug resistant bacteria. In a cover story in which Consumer Reports urged retailers to stop selling meat produced with antibiotics, the researchers noted some store employee confusion: “An assistant store manager at one grocery store, when asked by a shopper for meats raised without antibiotics, responded, ‘Wait, you mean like veggie burgers?’” On second thought maybe the employees weren’t so confused after all.

A-216	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/13/foods-for-computer-eye-strain/	Foods for Computer Eye Strain	What happens to our eyesight when we sit in front of a computer all day? As researchers from the SUNY College of Optometry note in a study profiled in my video, Dietary Treatments for Computer Eye Strain, the rise in computer screens “has led to an increase in ocular and visual problems, including eye discomfort, blurring of distant objects, eye strain, and asthenopia (visual fatigue).” This has caused so-called “nearwork-induced transient myopia.” That’s when after staring at a computer screen for a while we look out the window and things start out all blurry. Our vision becomes blurred because our poor little ciliary muscles pulling at our lens are locked in this constant state of contraction to keep that near focus. Over time, this may have long-term adverse consequences. How to Combat Computer Eye Strain Experts in the field recommend taking 4-12 minute breaks staring out the window every hour. We can also aid our vision with our diet. A double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, for example, found a significant improvement in refractive values and eyestrain symptoms when subjects ate black currants compared to a placebo. However, what passes for currants in the U.S. are usually champagne grape raisins, not actual black currants, which were banned in the U.S. a century ago at the behest of the lumber industry. The lumber industry feared that they might spread a plant disease that affects white pine (which we hardly even harvest any more). Black currants are, however, currently making a comeback (and the ban has been lifted in some states), though any anthocyanin-rich berry might have similar benefits (such as bilberries, blueberries, cranberries, black raspberries and red raspberries). Foods vs. Supplements Why bother with whole bilberries or black currants when we could just take anthocyanin supplements? Because, as we’ve seen over and over again, when we test supplements, we’re lucky if they actually contain what is listed on the label. Furthermore, even for products containing bilberries, one study found that labeling was often uninformative, misleading, or both, something for which the herbal supplement market is infamous. The largest study to date found that it appears most herbal supplement labels lie. Bilberries vs. Nazis Bilberries gained notoriety during World War II when it was said that pilots in the British Royal Air Force “were eating bilberry jam to improve their night vision.” It turns out this may have been a story concocted to fool the Germans. The real reason the Brits were able to suddenly target Nazi bombers in the middle of the night before the bombers even made it to the English channel was likely not because of bilberries, but because of a top secret new invention the British needed to keep quiet: radar. For best results when it comes to computer eye strain, stick to whole berries with blue and red pigments, and don’t forget to give your eyes a break each hour. For other videos on protecting our vision, check out Greens vs. Glaucoma, where I listed the best foods to help prevent glaucoma; in Dietary Prevention of Age-Related Macular Degeneration I did the same for age-related macular degeneration. I’ve also addressed the Dietary Treatment of Glaucoma. By using a standing or treadmill desk, we can avoid some of the other adverse health effects of sitting at a computer all day.

A-217	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/08/currant-treatment-for-glaucoma/	Currant Treatment for Glaucoma	In my video, Dietary Prevention for Age-Related Macular Degeneration, I discussed how eating goji berries with nuts and seeds can help build up yellow plant pigments such as lutein and zeaxanthin in our eyes to help fight age-related macular degeneration. But once we’ve preserved the pigment in our retinal pigment epithelial cells, we need to keep them alive. This may be where anthocyanin phytonutrients come in. Anthocyanins (from the Greek anthos, meaning flower, and kyanos, meaning blue) are natural plant pigments that make pansies look purple and turn green cabbage into purple cabbage, yellow corn into purple corn, brown rice to purple rice, white potatoes to blue potatoes, orange carrots to purple carrots, and keeps blueberries blue and blackberries black. As we age, our critical retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer starts to break down. However, we may be able to decelerate that aging with blueberries. In the study I profile in my video, Dietary Treatment of Glaucoma, human RPE cells bathed in blueberry anthocyanins had fewer free radicals and a lower proportion of aged cells, suggesting that blueberries and other red, blue, and purple pigmented fruits and vegetables may help prevent age-related macular degeneration. Blueberries may be especially important for blue eyes, as can be seen in my video Greens vs. Glaucoma. Preventing disease is nice, but what if we already have a disease like glaucoma, an incurable eye disease in which our optic nerve (which connects our eyes to our brain) starts deteriorating, and we start losing our visual fields? A few years ago, Japanese researchers showed they could apparently halt the progression of glaucoma with black currants. They gave people black currants for six months and found that black currants significantly boosted the blood flow to their optic nerve. The results suggest that black currants might be a safe and valuable option, but because the study was not double-blind and there was no control group, I didn’t report on it when it was initially published. But now we’ve got just such a study. Glaucoma patients were split into two groups—half got black currants; the other half didn’t. The study measured the deterioration of the patients’ visual fields in both groups in the two years leading up to the study. Despite taking the best glaucoma drugs on the market, the subjects’ visual fields deteriorated. Then the study starts. The berry-free control group continued to worsen, but the berries appeared to stop the disease in its tracks after both one and two years. And since there’s no downside to berries (only good side-effects), in my professional opinion everyone with glaucoma should be eating berries every day. For more on the latest science on preventing and treating vision loss, check out Greens vs. Glaucoma, where I detailed the best foods to help prevent glaucoma. My previous treatment of glaucoma can be found here: Prevent Glaucoma and See 27 Miles Farther. I’ve mentioned anthocyanins before in: They may be why purple potatoes (Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Purple Potatoes) and purple cabbage (Superfood Bargains) may be preferable. Anthocyanins are the pigments in red and purple cabbage that allow for the kitchen chemistry in Testing Your Diet with Pee & Purple Cabbage.

A-218	http://nutritionfacts.org/2015/01/01/foods-for-macular-degeneration/	Foods for Macular Degeneration	Anyone who has gotten a bad sunburn knows how damaging the UV rays in sunlight can be. Imagine what those same rays are doing to back of our eyeballs (our retinas). The eye is designed to take sunlight and focus it like a magnifying glass into the back of our eyes. Thankfully, we have a layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium that supports and protects our delicate retinal eyesight machinery. The layer builds up yellow plant pigments like zeaxanthin from our diet, absorbing blue light and protecting the retina from photo-oxidative damage. The yellowing of our corneas when we develop cataracts may actually be our bodies’ defense mechanism to protect our retinas. In fact, when cataracts are removed, the risk of blindness from macular generation shoots up (because we removed the protection). Instead of trading one type of vision loss for another, it’s better to pigment the back of our eyes through diet instead of pigmenting the front of our eyes with cataracts. The pigment in the back of our eyes is entirely of dietary origin, “suggesting that the most common cause of blind registration in the Western World could be delayed, or even averted, with appropriate dietary modification,” according to authors of a study on age-related macular degeneration. Where in our diet do we get these pigments? The egg industry brags that eggs are a good source, but have nearly six high-lutein, free-range, certified organic eggs a week for three months and the pigmentation in one’s eyes may only marginally increase (see Egg Industry Blind Spot). Instead of getting the phytonutrients from the egg that came from the chicken that came from the corn and blades of grass the chicken pecked on, we could get it from the source. One cup of corn and a half cup of spinach a day for three months seems to dramatically boost the protective eye pigment in subjects. In the video, Dietary Prevention of Age Related Macular Degeneration, you can see a comparison of the amount of these phytonutrients from eggs compared to corn and spinach. If we cut out the middlehen and get these nutrients from plants directly, we see a substantially larger increase in protective eye pigment. Three months after the subjects stopped eating the corn and spinach, the levels of these pigments remained relatively high, indicating that once we build our macular pigment up with a healthy diet, our eyeballs really try to hold on to it. So even if we go on vacation and end up eating more iceberg lettuce than spinach, our eyes will hold out until we get back. Eggs can increase zeaxanthin levels in the blood, but they can also raise bad cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease. Thus, as researchers conclude, “an egg yolk-based dietary strategy to increase plasma zeaxanthin cannot be recommended, and an alternative, cholesterol-free, food source is desirable.” One such alternative would be goji berries, which have up to 60 times more zeaxanthin than eggs. A modest dose of goji markedly increases levels in our body. Consumption of goji berries may be an effective, safe whole food strategy to increase zeaxanthin in the bloodstream. But we don’t need it in our blood, we need it in our eyes. A group of researchers performed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of goji berries at increasing pigment levels. To preserve eyesight in the elderly in traditional Chinese medicine, people are often prescribed 40 to 100 goji berries a day. In this study, participants consumed only about 15 berries a day for three months. Even at this small dose researchers  found that goji berries could protect against loss of pigment and prevent the buildup of debris that builds up in the back of the eye. Both loss of pigment and debris buildup are associated with age-related macular degeneration. Macular degeneration is the leading cause of legal blindness in older men and women, affecting more than ten million Americans, so increasing our consumption of these pigments as a society could significantly decrease the prevalence of blindness. In the above study, researchers gave the goji berries in milk so the butterfat could increase the absorption of these carotenoid pigments. A healthier way to get the same effect would just be to eat goji berries with nuts or seeds—in other words, goji trail mix. Though they didn’t appear to boost a measure of immune function (Boosting Natural Killer Cell Activity), goji berries are one of the most antioxidant packed snacks out there. A tip on getting them inexpensively can be found in my video Are Goji Berries Good for You? 	-	aging,blindness,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,chicken,cholesterol,eggs,eye disease,eye health,fat,glaucoma,goji berries,heart disease,heart health,LDL cholesterol,lettuce,lutein,macular degeneration,nuts,organic foods,oxidative stress,phytonutrients,poultry,seeds,spinach,vegetables,vision,zeaxanthin	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-prevention-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22018225,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-natural-killer-cell-activity/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11157880,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16988128,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-prevention-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21646980,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21169874,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15705234,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21354712,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9286268	
A-219	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/30/foods-for-glaucoma/	Foods for Glaucoma	Glaucoma is the second leading cause of legal blindness in white women, and the number one cause of blindness in African-American women. In a study I profile in the video Greens vs. Glaucoma, researchers chose a population of African-American women to study the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on glaucoma risk because they were specifically interested in studying the effect of foods with the highest concentration of those eye-protecting phytonutrients like zeaxanthin. Zeaxanthin is found primarily in plants such as kale and collard greens. (It is also found in eggs—find out how much in Egg Industry Blind Spot). However, we’d be lucky if we could find one in ten white people eating even a single serving of these dark green leafy vegetables a month, whereas nearly nine out of ten African-American women in the study consumed this amount. What did the researchers find? Well, as I’ve stressed over the years, all fruits and vegetables are not the same (see for example, How to Reach the Antioxidant “RDA“). Whether the participants hardly ever ate bananas or had one or more every day didn’t seem to matter much in terms of the risk of glaucoma. However, eating only a couple oranges every week was associated with dramatically lower risk. Orange juice was not associated with a lower risk, though, even if drunk every day. A similar finding was found for peaches: fresh peaches seemed to help, but canned peaches didn’t. Similarly the intake of vegetables in general as a catch-all term didn’t seem to matter. For example, whether subjects ate a green salad twice a week, once a week, or zero times a week didn’t seem to matter when it came to reducing glaucoma risk, but most people’s salads are pretty pitiful. It was a different story for kale and collard greens: just two or three servings a month was associated with half the risk of glaucoma compared to once a month or less. It may be especially important for white people to consume kale and collard greens. The lighter our eye color, the more greens we need to eat. Blue eyes let 100 times more light through, so people with blue or gray eyes appear significantly more vulnerable to damage compared to brown or black. Green and hazel fall somewhere in the middle. This is interesting: carrots appeared to be less protective in black women compared to white women. They suggest it could be a difference in food preparation methods. Perhaps the African-American subjects tended to eat carrots raw, limiting the absorption of certain nutrients, while they chopped and prepared their collard greens with oil, making the nutrients more bioavailable because the absorption of carotenoid phytonutrients depends on the presence of fat. This is why I encourage people to eat nuts or seeds with the greens—such as a little tahini sauce or something. Why not just take a zeaxanthin pill? We don’t know what exactly it is in these wonderful foods that’s working their wonders, so it’s probably better to just eat our greens rather than supplements. In fact, people that take calcium or iron supplements may even be doubling, quadrupling, or septupling their odds of glaucoma. It’s better to get most of our nutrients from produce, not pills. I wish there were more studies on under-represented populations. I’ve covered a few, such as Preventing Breast Cancer By Any Greens Necessary, but I am constantly on the lookout for more. My other videos on glaucoma include Prevent Glaucoma and See 27 Miles Farther and Dietary Treatment of Glaucoma.

A-220	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/25/how-long-to-avoid-fish-before-conception/	How Long to Avoid Fish Before Conception?	Mothers’ increased consumption of fish before and during pregnancy leads to increased exposure to both mercury and the long-chain omega 3 DHA. Mercury may negatively affect brain development in one’s unborn baby, whereas DHA may stimulate brain development. However, the negative effect of mercury appears to outweigh the beneficial effect of DHA for most species of fish (see Mercury vs. Omega-3s for Brain Development). Unfortunately, women of childbearing age appear less aware and knowledgeable about this problem than other women, despite FDA and EPA campaigns to inform every OB/GYN and pediatrician in the country about the potential risks of mercury in fish. Since mercury sticks around in the body, women may want to avoid fish with high levels of mercury for a year before they get pregnant, not just during pregnancy. The rationale for avoiding fish for a year before pregnancy is because the half-life of mercury in the body is estimated to be about two months. In a study I profile in my video How Long to Detox from Fish Before Pregnancy a group of researchers fed subjects two servings a week of tuna and other high mercury fish to push their mercury levels up, and then stopped the fish. Slowly but surely their levels came back down (see the video for the graph). I know a lot of moms are concerned about exposing their children to mercury containing vaccines, but if they eat even just a serving a week of fish during pregnancy, the latest data shows that their infants end up with substantially more mercury in their bodies than if they were injected with up to six mercury-containing vaccines. Given the two-month half-life of mercury, within a year of stopping fish consumption our bodies can detox nearly 99% of the mercury. Unfortunately the other industrial pollutants in fish can take longer for our body to get rid of. Certain dioxins, PCBs, and DDT metabolites found in fish have a half-life as long as ten years. So getting that same 99% drop could take 120 years, which is a long time to delay one’s first child. The fact that we can still find DDT in umbilical cord blood decades after the pesticide was banned speaks to the persistence of some pollutants. There’s a shortcut for moms, but it’s The Wrong Way to Detox. What effects do these other pollutants have? Well, high concentrations of industrial contaminants are associated with 38 times the odds of diabetes—that’s as strong as the relationship between smoking and lung cancer! Isn’t diabetes mostly associated with obesity though? Well, these pollutants are fat-soluble, so “as people get fatter the retention and toxicity of persistent organic pollutants related to the risk of diabetes may increase.” This suggests the shocking possibility that obesity “may only be a vehicle” for such chemicals. Now the pollutants could just be a marker for animal product consumption, which may be why there’s such higher diabetes risk, since more than 90% of the persistent organic pollutants comes from animal foods. And indeed, in the U.S. every additional serving of fish a week is associated with a 5% increased risk of diabetes, which makes fish consumption about 80% worse than red meat. PCBs are found most concentrated in fish and eggs (Food Sources of PCB Chemical Pollutants), which may be why there are lower levels of Industrial Pollutants in Vegans.

A-221	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/23/boosting-anti-cancer-immunity-with-berries/	Boosting Anticancer Immunity with Berries	For disease prevention and health maintenance, berries of all colors have “emerged as champions.” Research has focused mainly on cancer prevention and treatment. Studies show that the anticancer effects of berries are partially mediated through their abilities to counteract, reduce, and also repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation. Berries may also have many other positive effects, such as boosting detoxifying enzymes. One of the more remarkable effects is that of blueberries on natural killer cell counts. Natural killer cells are part of our immune system’s rapid response team against cancer cells, eliminating cancer cells through the activation of cancer cell suicide via death receptors. They’re called natural killers because they don’t require activation by prior exposure. We don’t want to wait until our second tumor before our immune system starts fighting. We have about two billion of these soldiers circulating in our blood stream at any one time, but we may be able to get a troop surge with blueberries. Researchers had athletes eat about a cup and a half of blueberries a day for six weeks to see if that would reduce the oxidative stress of long-distance running. They indeed saw a blunting of the spike in oxidant stress. But that’s not what sets that study apart. The number of natural killer cells in the blood typically decreases after prolonged endurance exercise, dropping by half to only about one billion—that is, unless we’ve been eating lots of blueberries. In the video, Boosting Natural Killer Cell Activity,  you can see a graph comparing natural killer cell numbers with and without blueberries.  Those who ate blueberries retained close to the standard two billion cells. This is because six weeks of blueberries had doubled the resting number of natural killer cells up to over four billion. This has never before been demonstrated in humans. There was a study on goji berries, but despite a cup a day for a month, there was no significant change in the number of natural killers. Another study, though, showed a significant increase in natural killer cell activity thanks to the spice cardamom. (Cardamom and blueberries—I never thought we’d be fighting cancer with blueberry muffins!) When researchers took some lymphoma cells in a petri dish and added cardamom, nothing happened. However, if we add some natural killer cells, about 5% of the cancer cells are wiped out. Add a little more cardamom, and our troops do better still. And then if we add more and more spice, then all of a sudden the natural killer cells are killing cancer like crazy—the same number of natural killer cells, but they’re now able to kill off ten times more cancer cells. While cardamom alone had no effect on cancer cells even at the highest dose, it seemed to enhance our natural killer cells’ killer instincts. The same thing was found for black pepper: Black pepper alone, nothing, but when combined with natural killer cells, there seemed to be a boosting effect up to around 30 or 40% cancer cell clearance. If cardamom and black pepper are combined, they synergize and their individual effects are doubled. The researchers conclude that “Taken together, these data strongly suggest that black pepper and cardamom have the potential to markedly enhance the anti-cancer activity of natural killer cells.” Exercise itself can improve immune function in general (See Preserving Immune Function in Athletes With Nutritional Yeast), but the blueberry finding, so far, is unique. The oxidative stress part of the story is told in Reducing Muscle Soreness With Berries. It is true that the blueberry study was funded by the North American Blueberry Council and the North Carolina High-bush Blueberry Council. However, just because the study was funded by blueberry councils doesn’t necessarily mean the science is suspect, but we would want to see the study independently verified, especially one so dramatic. What else can berries do?

A-222	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/18/the-vitamin-everyone-on-a-plant-based-diet-needs/	The Vitamin Everyone on a Plant-Based Diet Needs	A new study from China found that compared to omnivores, those who ate egg-free and meat-free diets had all the typical benefits of eating more plant-based: lower body mass index, lower blood pressure, lower triglyceride, lower total cholesterol, lower bad cholesterol, less free radical damage, etc. Having said that, if those on plant-based diets don’t get enough vitamin B12, levels of an artery-damaging compound called homocysteine can start to rise in the bloodstream and may counteract some of the benefits of healthy eating. In a study profiled in my video, Vitamin B12 Necessary for Arterial Health, a group of Taiwanese researchers found that the arteries of vegetarians were just as stiff as the omnivores and both had the same level of thickening in their carotid arteries, presumably because of the elevated homocysteine levels. The researchers concluded: “The negative findings of these studies should not be considered as evidence of neutral cardiovascular effects of vegetarianism, but do indicate an urgent need for modification of vegan diets through vitamin B12 fortification or supplementation. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a very serious problem leading ultimately to anemia, neuropsychiatric disorders, irreversible nerve damage, and high levels of artery-damaging homocysteine in the blood. Prudent vegans should include sources of vitamin B12 in their diets.” One study of vegetarians whose B12 levels were really hurting found that they had even thicker, more dysfunctional arteries than omnivores. How do we know B12 was to blame? Because once they were given B12 supplements they got better. Their arterial lining started to shrink back, and the proper functioning of their arteries returned. Without B12 fortified foods or B12 supplements, omnivores who were switched to a vegan diet developed vitamin B12 deficiency. Yes, it may take our blood levels dropping down to around 150 picomoles per liter to develop classic signs of B12 deficiency, like anemia or spinal cord degeneration, but way before that, we may start getting increased risk of cognitive deficits and brain shrinkage, stroke, depression, and nerve and bone damage. The rise in homocysteine may attenuate the beneficial effects of a vegetarian diet on cardiovascular health. The researchers concluded that while the beneficial effects of vegetarian diets on cholesterol and blood sugars “need to be advocated, but at the same time efforts to correct vitamin B12 deficiency in vegetarian diets can never be overestimated.” 	-	anemia,b12,blood pressure,blood sugar,bone health,brain disease,brain health,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,China,cholesterol,cognition,depression,eggs,heart disease,heart health,homocysteine,hypertension,kidney disease,kidney failure,kidney function,kidney health,LDL cholesterol,meat,mental health,neuropathy,omnivores,oxidative stress,plant-based diets,stroke,supplements,triglycerides,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,vitamin B12	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-get-b12/	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16005009,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22412169,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21915169,http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-get-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22659999,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22092891,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/25/vegan-b12-deficiency-putting-it-into-perspective/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493163,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-223	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/16/comparing-vegans-arteries-to-runners/	Comparing Vegans' Arteries to Runners'	We know from the work of Drs. Dean Ornish and Caldwell B. Esselstyn Jr. that switching to a plant-based diet can reverse heart disease, opening up arteries in some cases without drugs or surgery. We can’t wait until our first heart attack to start eating healthy, though, because our first symptom of heart disease may be our last (See China Study on Sudden Cardiac Death). Fifty percent of men and 64% of women who die suddenly from coronary heart disease have no previous symptoms. To predict the risk of dying from a heart attack, we can measure risk factors such as cholesterol levels and blood pressure. But wouldn’t it be nice to actually see what’s going on inside our arteries before it’s too late? Our imaging technologies are so good now that we can, but the required dose of radiation delivered to one’s chest is so high that a young woman getting just a single scan may increase her lifetime risk of breast cancer and lung cancer by between around 1% and 4%. More on the radiation risks associated with diagnostic procedures in Cancer Risk From CT Scan Radiation and Do Dental X-Rays Cause Brain Tumors? Our carotid arteries, though, which connect our heart to our brain, come close enough to the surface in our necks that we can visualize the arterial wall using harmless sound waves (ultrasound). Carotid artery wall thickness is what was measured in the study I profiled in Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis. How do the arteries of those eating plant-based diets compare to those eating the standard American diet? Researchers gathered up some vegans to find out. In the video, Arteries of Vegans vs. Runners, you can see the thickness of the inner wall of the carotid arteries where the atherosclerotic plaque (considered a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality) builds up in the standard American diet group. This same inner layer was significantly slimmer in vegans, but so were the vegans themselves. Those eating the standard American diet were, on average, overweight with a BMI over 26 while the vegans were a trim 21—about 36 pounds lighter on average. So maybe the only reason those eating meat, eggs, and dairy had thickened arterial walls was because they were overweight—maybe the diet per se had nothing to do with it. To solve the riddle one would have to find a group of people still eating the standard American diet, but as slim as vegans. To find a group that trim, researchers had to use long-distance endurance athletes, who ate the standard American diet, but ran an average of 48 miles per week for 21 years. Both the vegans and the conventional diet group were sedentary—less than an hour of exercise a week. As you can see in the video, the average thickness of endurance runners’ carotid arteries is between that of sedentary vegans and omnivores. It appears that if we run an average of about a thousand miles every year we can rival some couch potato vegans. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do both. Another comparison between athletes and plant-eaters can be found in Is It the Diet, the Exercise, or Both? It compares cancer-fighting abilities with a similar result. None of this is to disparage exercise, which is critical for a variety of important reasons, immunity (Preserving Immune Function in Athletes With Nutritional Yeast), breast health (Exercise & Breast Cancer), and brain protection (Reversing Cognitive Decline). So diet and exercise, not or exercise. My physical activity comes from walking while I work: Standing Up for Your Health. Not all studies showed vegans have superior arterial form and function.

A-224	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/11/add-beans-berries-and-greens-to-more-meals/	Add Beans, Berries, and Greens to More Meals	After we eat, our bodies create free radicals in the process of breaking down our food. That’s why we need to eat antioxidant-rich foods with every meal to counteract this oxidation caused by metabolism. We can’t just have berries on our oatmeal in the morning to meet our Minimum Recommended Daily Allowance of Antioxidants and call it a day. Each and every meal should contain high antioxidant foods, which means that each and every meal should contain whole plant foods. Antioxidant rich foods originate from the plant kingdom, due to the thousands of different natural antioxidant compounds naturally created by the plants we eat. Consuming fruits—which are high in phenolic phytonutrients—increases the antioxidant capacity of the blood. When fruits are consumed along with high fat and refined carbohydrate “pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory” meals, they may help counterbalance their negative effects. Given the content and availability of fat and sugars in the Western diet, regular consumption of phenolic-rich foods, particularly in conjunction with meals, appears to be a prudent strategy to maintain oxidative balance and health. And of all fruits, berries may be the best source of phytonutrients. In the video, How to Reach the Antioxidant “RDA”, you can see an example of the spike in oxidation caused by a Mediterranean meal of pasta, tomato sauce, olive oil, and fried fish. Obviously, given the spike of oxidation, there were not enough tomatoes. Add a glass of red wine, which contains berry phytonutrients from grapes, and we can bring down, but not blunt completely, the level of oxidation. So the meal needs even more plants. In a study I profile in the video, researchers gave subjects standard breakfast items, resulting in lots of oxidized cholesterol in their bloodstream one to six hours after the meal. But all it took was a cup of strawberries with that same breakfast to at least keep the meal from contributing to further oxidation. In my Food Antioxidants and Cancer video, you can see a comparison of breakfast with berries versus breakfast without. If we don’t consume high-antioxidant plants with breakfast, by lunch we’ll already be in oxidative debt. Let’s say we ate a standard American breakfast at 6 a.m. If we didn’t eat that cup of strawberries with breakfast, by the time lunch rolls around we’d already be starting out in the hyper-oxidized state, and lunch could just make things worse. Since western eating patterns include eating multiple meals a day, including snacks, one can only speculate on the level of biological unrest. If we have some berries for breakfast, at least we’d be starting out at baseline for lunch. This acute protection is likely due to the antioxidant effects of the strawberry phytonutrients. What if, by lunch, we could be even better than baseline? How about our meals actually improving our antioxidant status? If, for example, we eat a big bunch of red grapes with our meal, the antioxidant level of our bloodstream goes up and our bodies are in positive antioxidant balance for a few hours. We get the same result after eating enough blueberries. And imagine if in these ensuing hours before our next meal we were sipping green tea, hibiscus tea or even whole cranberries? (See Pink Juice with Green Foam). We’d have a nice antioxidant surplus all day long. One group of researchers conclude: “These data provide an interesting perspective for advising individuals on food choice when consuming a moderate- to high-fat meal is unavoidable.” (Unavoidable? So what, if we’re locked in a fast food joint or something?) They suggest chasing whatever we’re forced to eat with some berries. Reminds me of those studies I’ve talked about suggesting that smokers should eat lots of kale and broccoli to reduce the oxidative damage to their DNA. Of course, they could also just not smoke. In a single day, the systemic stress of all the fat in our blood and “redox imbalance” (being in a mild pro-oxidant state after meals) may seem trivial. Over time, however, these daily insults can lead to problems such as heart disease, contributing to the hundreds of thousands of deaths a year (See The Power of NO). I strive to eat berries every day and so should everyone. If we are going to drink wine, red is preferable (See Breast Cancer Risk: Red Wine vs. White Wine) See how quickly stress can eat our antioxidants in: Antioxidant Level Dynamics. I used a similar meal-components technique to illustrate the potent antioxidant power of spices. See Antioxidants in a Pinch. All fruits and veggies aren’t the same. I make this point in different ways in videos like Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better? and Anti-Inflammatory Antioxidants. I have a series of videos on which foods have the most antioxidants. See Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods and Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. Note these are measured based on test tube tests. There are more sophisticated ways to measure antioxidant activity. See Anti Up on the Veggies. What’s the cheapest common source of whole food antioxidants? See Superfood Bargains for a dollar per dollar comparison. What’s the cheapest uncommon source? See Dragon’s Blood. Are there diminishing returns to getting too many antioxidants? See Maxing Out on Antioxidants. So if we have that bowl of berries in the morning to meet our minimum daily antioxidant needs can we just call it a day?.

Learn how the industry attempted to undermine the global scientific consensus and the fatal flaw in the recent saturated fat meta-analysis in a new series of videos I just completed. They are all available right now as a video download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 22 (all proceeds go to this charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD. The saturated fat videos are all scheduled to go up on NutritionFacts.org early next year, but you can download and watch them right now. The current batch of videos from volume 21 on NutritionFacts.org is set to run out soon, so starting next month and running through January, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 22. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–40+ hours of video–you can get the complete DVD collection. Here’s the list of chapters from the new volume 22 DVD — a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org: Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon.

A-226	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/04/how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day/	How to Get Enough Antioxidants Each Day	We need to get a daily minimum of 8-11,000 antioxidant units a day in our food just to stay out of oxidative debt (see my video on The Reason We Need More Antioxidants). To reach that minimum, all we have to do is eat lots of fruits and vegetables, right? Not exactly. Let’s say I ate a whole banana during breakfast (in addition to whatever else). For lunch I eat a typical American salad— iceberg lettuce, half cup of cucumber slices, and canned peaches for dessert. Supper included a side serving of peas and carrots and half a cup of snap peas along with yet another salad. And, finally, let’s say I had a cup of watermelon for dessert. I just ate nine servings of fruits and vegetables and am feeling all good about myself. However, I only made it up to 2700 units, less than a quarter of the way to my minimum daily recommended intake. What am I supposed to do, eat 36 servings a day? (For a cool visual of this, check out my video, How to Reach the Antioxidant “RDA”). What if instead of that banana, I had a single serving of blueberries? And instead of iceberg lettuce for that afternoon salad, I ate four leaves of red leaf lettuce, maybe some kidney beans on top, and a teaspoon of dried oregano as a bonus? For a snack, I had an apple and some dates. It’s not even suppertime, only had five servings, yet I’ve left the minimum recommended daily intake of antioxidants in the dust (topping 28,000 units!). That’s why it’s not just quantity of fruits and veggies that matters, but also the quality. All fruits and veggies aren’t the same. I make this point in different ways in videos like Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better? and Anti-Inflammatory Antioxidants. If possible, we should try to choose the healthiest options out there. Now that it’s midday and I’ve reached my daily minimum of antioxidants with those five super servings, can I just eat whatever I want for dinner? That’s probably not a good idea. The estimated minimum antioxidant need of 8,000-11,000 units does not take into account the added amounts needed if other oxidant stressors—”such as illness, cigarette smoke, meat consumption, air pollution, sleep deprivation”—are present. If we had to deal with these stressors we’d need to consume more fruits and veggies just to stay out of the red. In my video Antioxidant Level Dynamics, I profiled a study that used an argon laser to measure human antioxidant levels in real time. The study’s most important finding was that antioxidant levels can plummet within two hours of a stressful event, but it may take up to three days to get our levels back to normal. The take-home message is that, especially when we’re sick, stressed, or tired, we should try to go above and beyond the antioxidant food minimum. Ideally, we need to be constantly soaking our bloodstream with antioxidants, meaning that we should consume high-powered fruits and vegetables—like berries, beans, and green tea or hibiscus—all day long. Unsure of which foods have the most antioxidants? I have a series of videos on this very topic. See Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods and Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. (Note these are measured based on test tube tests. There are more sophisticated ways to measure antioxidant activity. See Anti Up on the Veggies). Spices in particular present a powerful source of antioxidants. See Antioxidants in a Pinch. What’s the cheapest common source of whole food antioxidants? See Superfood Bargains for a dollar per dollar comparison. What’s the cheapest uncommon source? See Dragon’s Blood. Are there diminishing returns to getting too many antioxidants? See Maxing Out on Antioxidants. So if we have that bowl of berries in the morning to meet our minimum daily antioxidant needs can we just call it a day?

A-227	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/12/02/the-reason-we-need-more-antioxidants-and-why-were-not-getting-them/	The Reason We Need More Antioxidants	Glucose is the primary fuel of the human body. We consume glucose and breathe in oxygen to make the energy needed to power our bodies. Plants then take the water and carbon dioxide we breathe out to make oxygen and organic compounds like glucose—and the circle of life continues. The word carbohydrate means, basically, hydrated carbon, which is what plants use to make carbs and all that’s left after we burn them for energy in our muscles and brain. This process of oxidizing glucose to make energy is messy, though, and generates free radicals. Chugging sugar water increases the level of oxidation in our bloodstreams over the next few hours as our bodies metabolize the glucose. (Digestion isn’t the only physiological source of free radicals—exercise is too. See Preventing Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress With Watercress). Why would we evolve to have a negative reaction to our primary fuel? Because over the millions of years we evolved, there was no such thing as sugar water—all sugars and starches came pre-packaged with protective compounds: antioxidants. In nature, sugar always comes with phytonutrients. If we drink the same amount of sugar in the form of orange juice, we don’t get that spike in oxidation, because the sugar in fruit comes prepackaged with antioxidants. We can’t just drink vitamin C enriched sugar water either, because it’s not the vitamin C in the OJ but the citrus phytonutrients like hesperetin and naringenin that beat back the oxidation. And it’s always better to eat the whole fruit than drink the juice (See Best Fruit Juice and Apple Juice May Be Worse Than Sugar Water). If those citrus phytonutrients sounded familiar to you, it’s because I mentioned them before in videos like Keeping Your Hands Warm With Citrus and Reducing Muscle Fatigue With Citrus. If we don’t eat phytonutrient-rich plant foods with each meal, then for hours after we eat, our bodies are tipped out of balance into a pro-oxidative state, which can set us up for oxidant stress diseases. That’s why we need to ideally eat antioxidant rich foods with every meal. In the video, Minimum “Recommended Daily Allowance” of Antioxidants, we can see the levels of oxidized fat in our blood one, two, and three hours after sugar water ingestion, and the corresponding drop in vitamin E levels in our blood as our body’s antioxidant stores are being used up. If we don’t eat phytonutrient-rich foods with our meals, our body has to dip into its backup supply of antioxidants. We can’t get away with that for long. So while ideally we should stuff our faces with as many phytonutrient-rich foods as we can. In  the very least we should eat enough antioxidants to counter the oxidation of digestion. We don’t want to slide backwards every day and end up with less antioxidants in our bodies than we woke up with. A chart in the video, Minimum “Recommended Daily Allowance” of Antioxidants, shows the amount of antioxidants we need every day, depending on how much we eat, just to counter the oxidation of digestion. Men in the U.S. average about 2500 calories a day and so should be getting at least 11,000 antioxidant units a day. Women eat about 1800 calories and so should get at least 8,000 units just to stay solvent. However, the average American doesn’t even get half the minimum–no wonder oxidant stress related diseases abound. We’re getting so few antioxidants in our diet that we can’t even keep up with the free radicals created by merely digesting our meals. We are a nation in chronic oxidative debt. Developed societies eat a lot of food but not enough plants, which could result in exaggerated and prolonged metabolic, oxidative, and immune imbalance. This presents opportunity for biological insult that over time could supersede our defense and repair systems, and manifest in cellular dysfunction, disease, and ultimately death. Is there a refined sweetener that doesn’t cause free radical formation? Yes: Erythritol May Be a Sweet Antioxidant. What’s the best way of reaching our daily minimum of 8,000-11,000 antioxidant units a day? That’s covered in my video How to Reach the Antioxidant “RDA“. Background on the role free radicals play in aging and disease can be found in my video Mitochondrial Theory of Aging. Antioxidant-rich diets can even change gene expression: Plant-Based Diets and Cellular Stress Defenses. 	-	antioxidants,chronic diseases,dietary guidelines,energy,fat,fruit,fruit juice,heart disease,heart health,immune function,juice,mortality,orange juice,oranges,oxidative stress,phytonutrients,Standard American Diet,sugar,vitamin C,vitamin E	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-exercise-induced-oxidative-stress-with-watercress/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reach-the-antioxidant-rda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruit-juice/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17536129,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/222498,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/minimum-recommended-daily-allowance-of-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apple-juice-may-be-worse-than-sugar-water/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10946914,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-rich-foods-with-every-meal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-exercise-induced-oxidative-stress-with-watercress/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/	
A-228	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/27/how-avoiding-eggs-could-help-you-avoid-diabetes/	How Avoiding Eggs Could Help You Avoid Diabetes	Type 2 diabetes is becoming a global pandemic. We know the consumption of eggs is related to the development of some other chronic diseases, what about diabetes? There appears to be a stepwise increase in risk as more and more eggs are consumed. One study found that eating just a single egg a week increased the odds of diabetes by 76%. Two eggs a week doubled the odds, and an egg a day tripled the odds. Recent studies, profiled in my video Eggs and Diabetes, have confirmed the link. In 2009, Harvard researchers found that a single egg a day or more was associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes in men and women. This finding has since been confirmed in Asia in 2011 and in Europe in 2012. Reducing egg consumption should start early in life, though, as it appears once we get into our 70s, it may be too late. For those with diabetes, eggs may then hasten our death. Eating one egg or more a day appears to shorten anyone’s lifespan, but may be even worse for those with diabetes, potentially doubling all-cause mortality, meaning egg-eating diabetics seem to live particularly short lives. This is not good news for the egg industry. From a transcript of a closed meeting I got through the Freedom of Information Act, one egg industry advisor said, “Given the rate at which obesity and incidence of type II diabetes is growing in the US, any association between dietary cholesterol and type II diabetes could be a ‘showstopper’ that could overshadow the positive attributes in eggs.” More Freedom of Information Act insights into the egg industry can be found in: Flax seeds may help control blood sugars (Flaxseeds for Diabetes) as well as Indian gooseberries (Amla Versus Diabetes), but our best bet may be a diet composed entirely of plants (How to Prevent Diabetes and How to Treat Diabetes). 	-	aging,amputations,Asia,blindness,chronic diseases,diabetes,eggs,Europe,eye disease,eye health,Freedom of Information Act,Harvard,industry influence,kidney disease,kidney failure,kidney function,kidney health,lifespan,mortality	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/08/flaxseeds-for-diabetes/	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/methionine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/choline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390963,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400720,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471806,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-and-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/08/flaxseeds-for-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19017774,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22850191	
A-229	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/25/healthy-holiday-eating/	Guest Blog: Healthy Holiday Eating	Imagine if, instead of a Thanksgiving dinner or winter celebration meal that left you and your guests overweight and over-stuffed, you had a meal that was both superbly satisfying and healthful! It could be the perfect opportunity to introduce some delicious plant-based holiday options to your family and friends. If you are the guest, bring a fabulous main dish to share. A number of national health organizations– U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have given nutrient density ratings that qualify certain foods as “powerhouse” foods.1 Powerhouse fruits and vegetables are defined as those that provide, on average, 10 percent or more per 100 calories of 17 qualifying nutrients that are deemed of public health importance by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and Institute of Medicine. including iron, zinc, potassium, numerous B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and B6), and vitamins A (as carotenoids), C, E, and K. The powerhouse foods they list—all plant foods–contain a wealth of protective phytochemicals that are linked with reduced risk of chronic disease. Eight of the nutrients provided are deemed particularly protective against heart disease and cancer. Instead of a meal that is centered on turkey, an entree that is nearly devoid of phytochemicals, your health will get a big boost. Your taste buds will be happy too! Identified powerhouse foods include winter squash, kale and other leafy greens (Chinese/napa cabbage, leaf or romaine lettuce, collard greens), Brussels sprouts, turnips, carrots, pumpkin, and lime or lemon. These can feature in a celebration meal that is satisfying, delicious, and beautiful! To round out a meal, add a salad (lettuce and berries), seasoned and baked tofu, gravy, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. Here are some recipes: Kale and Red Pepper Holiday Wreath Makes about 5 cups From “Cooking Vegan” by Vesanto Melina RD and Joseph Forest.  Book Publishing Co. 2012 The deep green kale, tossed with pieces of bright red bell pepper, provide a rich source of calcium, iron, potassium, the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E, and omega 3 fatty acids. For a larger wreath, double the recipe. Including tahini as an ingredient is a delicious option, though the wreath will not be such a bright green. Place kale in a steamer, cover, and steam over medium-high heat until the kale is soft to the bite. Drain in a colander and squeeze out any excess water. With a fork, combine the lemon juice, tamari, and tahini (if using) in a large bowl. Add the kale and toss to coat the leaves with dressing. Arrange on a warm platter to create a round wreath shape, leaving a clean open space in the center. Sprinkle with the red pepper and serve.         Holiday Winter Stuffed Squash    Makes 1 stuffed squash, about 8 servings, with 5 cups stuffing From “Cooking Vegan” by Vesanto Melina RD and Joseph Forest.  Book Publishing Co. 2012. 1 winter squash, about 5 lbs (Hubbard, butternut, acorn, kabocha, or turban) Quinoa Stuffing Squash Pre heat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Pierce the top of the squash with a sharp knife at 45 degree angle 2-inches (5 cm) over from the top. Pushing the knife blade away from your body, cut around the top of the squash and remove the cone-shaped top piece. Remove any fibrous material from the cone and set the top aside. Remove the seeds and pulp from the cavity of the squash with a spoon. Put the top back on the squash, put on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 15 minutes. Stuffing Bring 1-1/2 cups water to a boil over high heat in a small sauce pan. Stir in quinoa and salt, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Put into a large bowl and set aside to cool. Heat 1/4 cup water in a skillet over medium heat and cook onion for 5 to 7 minutes or until tender. Add the garlic and celery and cook for 3 minutes. Stir into the cooled quinoa along with the corn, red pepper, sunflower seeds, parsley, lime juice, basil, dill, thyme, and pepper. Mix and adjust the seasoning.  	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://1.usa.gov/1no2nYX	
A-230	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/20/how-beans-help-our-bones/	How Beans Help Our Bones	Health authorities from all over the world universally recommend increasing the consumption of whole grains and legumes—beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils—for health promotion. But what about the phytates? Phytate is a naturally occurring compound found in all plant seeds (like beans, grains, and nuts) that over the decades has been maligned as mineral absorption inhibitors. That’s why, for example, one hears advice to roast, sprout, or soak your nuts to get rid of the phytates so we can absorb more minerals, like calcium. The concern about phytates and bone health arose from a series of laboratory experiments performed on puppies published in 1949, which suggested that high phytate diets have a bone softening and anti-calcifying effect. Subsequent studies on rats, in which they fed them the equivalent of ten loaves of bread a day, “confirmed” phytate’s status as a so-called anti-nutrient. But more recently, in the light of actual human data, phytate’s image has undergone a makeover. A recent study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food asked a simple question: Do people who avoid high phytate foods—legumes, nuts, and whole grains—have better bone mineral density? No. Those that consumed more high-phytate foods actually had stronger bones, as measured in the heel, spine and hip. The researchers conclude that dietary phytate consumption had protective effects against osteoporosis and that low phytate consumption should actually be what’s considered an osteoporosis risk factor. A follow-up study, measuring phytate levels flowing through women’s bodies and following bone mass over time, found the same thing: women with the highest phytate levels had the lowest levels of bone loss in the spine and hip. Those who ate the most phytates were also estimated to have a significantly lower risk of major fracture, and a lower risk of hip fracture specifically. This is consistent with reports that phytate can inhibit the dissolution of bone similar to anti-osteoporosis drugs like Fosamax. Phytates don’t have the side effects, though, such as osteonecrosis (bone death) associated with that class of drugs. People take these drugs to protect their bones, but by doing so may also risk rotting them away (See Phytates for the Prevention of Osteoporosis). Eating healthy can help us avoid other drugs as well. See, for example: Beans might not just help our skeleton last longer, but the rest of us as well. See Increased Lifespan From Beans. How might one boost mineral absorption? See New Mineral Absorption Enhancers Found. Alkaline Diets, Animal Protein, & Calcium Loss is another surprising video on bone health.

A-231	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/18/what-is-actually-in-chicken-nuggets/	What is Actually in Chicken Nuggets?	In a scathing expose of the USDA’s new meat inspection program, the Washington Post quoted a representative from the meat inspectors union, who said: “pig processing lines may be moving too quickly to catch tainted meat… Tremendous amounts of fecal matter remain on the carcasses. Not small bits, but chunks.” What about the other white meat? In the video, Autopsy of Chicken Nuggets, you can see an infographic the Physician’s Committee for Responsible Medicine created to highlight what they consider to be the five worst contaminants in chicken products. In their investigation of retail chicken products in ten U.S. cities, they found fecal contamination in about half the chicken they bought at the store. But with all the focus on what’s in chicken products, we may have lost sight on what may be missing—such as actual chicken. Researchers from the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the Baptist Medical Center recently published an “autopsy” of chicken nuggets in the American Journal of Medicine. The purpose was to determine the contents of chicken nuggets from two national food chains. Because chicken nuggets are popular among children, the researchers thought that parents should know more about what they may be feeding to their kids. The nugget from the first restaurant was composed of approximately 50% skeletal muscle, with the remainder composed primarily of fat, blood vessels and nerves, and generous quantities of skin or gut lining and associated supportive tissue. The nugget from the second restaurant was composed of approximately 40% skeletal muscle with lots of other tissues, including bone. “I was floored,” said the lead investigator. “I had read what other reports have said is in them and I didn’t believe it. I was astonished actually seeing it under the microscope.” I profile some of those other pathology reports in my videos What‘s in a Burger? and What Is Really in Hot Dogs? The researchers concluded that since actual chicken meat was not the predominant component of either nugget, the term “chicken” nugget was really a misnomer. If we’re going to eat something chicken-ish that isn’t chicken meat, why not truly boneless chicken: Chicken vs. Veggie Chicken.

A-232	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/13/does-caramel-color-cause-cancer/	Does Caramel Color Cause Cancer?	Used as a coloring agent in products ranging from colas and beer to gravies and soy sauce, caramel coloring may be the world’s most widely consumed food coloring. It helps grocery stores sell more than a billion servings of food and beverages a day. Unfortunately, the manufacturing of certain artificial caramel colorings can lead to the formation of carcinogens such as 4-methylimidazole, which causes cancer in mice but not rats (or at least, not male rats). However, it is unclear whether humans are more like mice or rats in terms of their response to the carcinogen. To be safe, California officially listed it as a carcinogen and started requiring warning labels on soft drinks containing more than 29 micrograms per serving. The soft drink industry was unsuccessful in opposing the action, so they were forced to reduce carcinogen levels in their products—but only in California. Buy Coke anywhere else, and it may have up to five times the limit (See Is Caramel Color Carcinogenic?). There’s another class of additives that the soda industry uses to make its soda brown (see Phosphate Additives in Meat Purge and Cola). There are other harmful additives in soda as well (Is Sodium Benzoate Harmful? and Diet Soda and Preterm Birth). Similarly the junk food industry uses titanium dioxide to whiten processed foods (Titanium Dioxide & Inflammatory Bowel Disease). The meat industry has also used potentially toxic additives for cosmetic purposes such as arsenic-containing drugs (Arsenic in Chicken) and phosphate additives in chicken to make poultry pink. Carbon monoxide is used to keep red meat red, and acanthoxanthins keep salmon pink (Artificial Coloring in Fish). It’s amazing the risks the food industry will take to alter appearances (Artificial Food Colors and ADHD). 	-	artificial colors,beer,beverages,California,cancer,caramel color,carcinogens,Coca Cola,food additives,gravy,industry influence,Pepsi,safety limits,soda,soy sauce	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-soda-and-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17619857,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caramel-color-carcinogenic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-soda-and-preterm-birth/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23026009,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/titanium-dioxide-inflammatory-bowel-disease/	
A-233	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/11/we-can-end-the-heart-disease-epidemic/	We Can End the Heart Disease Epidemic	Many of the diseases that are common in United States are rare or even nonexistent in populations eating mainly whole plant foods. These so-called Western Diseases are some of our most common conditions: These diseases are common in the West, but are rarities among plant-based populations. A landmark study in 1959 I profiled in my video Cavities and Coronaries: Our Choice, for example, suggested that coronary heart disease was practically non-existent among those eating traditional plant-based diets in Uganda. “Doctors in sub-Saharan Africa during the ‘30s and ‘40s recognized that certain diseases commonly seen in Western communities were rare in rural African peasants. This hearsay talk greeted any new doctor on arrival in Africa. Even the teaching manuals stated that diabetes, coronary heart disease, appendicitis, peptic ulcer, gallstones, hemorrhoids, and constipation were rare in African blacks who eat foods that contain many skins and fibers, such as beans and corn, and pass a bulky stool two or three times a day. Surgeons noticed that the common acute abdominal emergencies in Western communities were virtually absent in rural African peasants.” But did they have hard data to back it up? Yes. Major autopsy series were performed. In one thousand Kenyan autopsies, there were “no cases of appendicitis, not a single heart attack, only three cases of diabetes, one peptic ulcer, no gallstones, and no evidence of high blood pressure” (which alone affects one out of three Americans). Maybe the Africans were just dying early of other diseases and so never lived long enough to get heart disease? No. In the video One in a Thousand: Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic, you can see the age-matched heart attack rates in Uganda versus St. Louis. Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda, only one myocardial infarction. Out of 632 Missourians—with the same age and gender distribution—there were 136 myocardial infarctions. More than 100 times the rate of our number one killer. In fact, researchers were so blown away that they decided to do another 800 autopsies in Uganda. Still, just that one small healed infarct (meaning it wasn’t even the cause of death) out of 1,427 patients. Less than one in a thousand, whereas in the U.S., it’s an epidemic. If heart disease is so rare in rural Africa, how do the local doctors even know what to look for? Though practically unheard of among the native population, the physicians are quite familiar with heart disease because of all the Westerners that immigrate to the country. The famous surgeon Dr. Denis Burkitt insisted that modern medicine is treating disease all wrong: “A highly unacceptable fact—that is rarely considered yet indisputable—is that, with rare exceptions, there is no evidence that the incidence of any disease was ever reduced by treatment. Improved therapies may reduce mortality but may not reduce the incidence of the disease.” Take cancer, for example, where the vast majority of effort is devoted to advances in treatment, and second priority is given to screening programs attempting early diagnosis. Is there any evidence that the incidence of any form of cancer has been reduced by improved treatment or by early detection? Early diagnosis may reduce mortality rates, and medical services can have a profoundly beneficial effect on sick people, but neither have little (if any) effect on the number of people becoming ill. No matter how fancy heart disease surgery gets, it’s never going to reduce the number of people falling victim to the disease. Dr. Burkitt compared the situation to an engine left out in the rain: “If an engine repeatedly stops as a consequence of being exposed to the elements, it is of limited value to rely on the aid of mechanics to detect and remedy the fault. Examination of all engines would reveal that those out in the rain were stopping, but those under cover were running well. The correct approach would then be to provide protection from the offending environment. However, considering the failing engine as the ailing patient, this is seldom the priority of modern medicine.” Dr. Burkitt sums it up with the analogy of The Cliff or the Ambulance: “If people are falling over the edge of a cliff and sustaining injuries, the problem could be dealt with by stationing ambulances at the bottom or erecting a fence at the top. Unfortunately, we put far too much effort into the provision of ambulances and far too little into the simple approach of erecting fences.” And of course there are all the industries enticing people to the edge, and profiting from pushing people off. If all plant-based diets could do is reverse our number one killer, then shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? The fact that it also appears to reverse other leading killers like diabetes and hypertension appears to make the case for plant-based eating overwhelming. So why doesn’t the medical profession embrace it? It may be because of The Tomato Effect. Why don’t many individual doctors do it? It may be because lifestyle medicine hurts the bottom line (see Lifestyle Medicine: Treating the Causes of Disease). Why doesn’t the federal government recommend it? It may be because of the self-interest of powerful industries (see The McGovern Report). But you can take your destiny into your own hands (mouth?) and work with your doctor to clean up your diet and maximize your chances of living happily ever after. 	-	abdominal pain,Africa,appendicitis,beans,body fat,cancer,cancer survival,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,colon cancer,colon health,constipation,corn,diabetes,diverticulosis,fat,fiber,gallbladder health,gallstones,heart disease,heart health,hemorrhoids,hernia,hiatal hernia,hypertension,lifespan,Lifestyle medicine,medical profession,mortality,obesity,plant-based diets,prediabetes,rectal cancer,Standard American Diet,stomach health,stomach ulcers,stool size,surgery,Uganda,varicose veins,vegans,vegetarians	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2006199,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3031417,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21308015,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lifestyle-medicine-treating-the-causes-of-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1998476,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23045195,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13838030,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-234	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/06/how-to-prevent-heart-disease/	How to Prevent Heart Disease	Many of today’s lifestyle medicine doctors, myself included, were greatly influenced by Nathan Pritikin, the nutrition pioneer who started reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and exercise back in the 70s. (More on Nathan Pritikin in Engineering a Cure,  Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped, and The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle.) But how did he come up with the idea of opening up arteries without drugs or surgery? We tend to think of rural China as a place with a fraction of our disease rates, but we may forget about Africa. Pritikin was 43 when he was told by his cardiologist that he was going to die from a heart attack, so he began to live on a diet patterned after the black population in Uganda, a population living off plants that was essentially free from death from heart attacks. After curing his own heart disease with a plant-based diet, he went on to save the lives of thousands of others. What was the data that so convinced him? Last year, the International Journal of Epidemiology reprinted a landmark article from the ‘50s that started out with a shocking statement: “In the African population of Uganda, coronary heart disease is almost non-existent.” Our number one cause of death almost nonexistent? What were they eating? Plantains and sweet potatoes, other vegetables, corn, millet, pumpkins, tomatoes, and “green leafy vegetables are taken by all.” Their protein was almost entirely from plant sources, and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it, similar to modern-day plant-eaters. “Apart from the effects of diet and of the blood cholesterol levels,” the researchers couldn’t figure out any other reasons for their freedom from heart disease. These fifty-year-old findings are still relevant today. They showed “dietary intake to be a key, modifiable, established and well-recognized risk factor for heart attacks. This contrasts with the rather desperate search in recent decades for even newer cardiovascular risk factors.” We have the only risk factor we need—cholesterol. We’ve known it for 50 years, and we can do something about it. See One in a Thousand: Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic. As you can see in the video Cavities and Coronaries: Our Choice, according to the Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Cardiology, the only risk factor required for atherosclerotic plaques to form is elevated LDL, or “bad” cholesterol in our blood. Dr. William Clifford Roberts is the distinguished cardiac pathologist who doubles as the Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Cardiology. More from him in Eliminating the #1 Cause of Death and Heart Attacks and Cholesterol: Purely a Question of Diet. To drop our LDL cholesterol, we need to drop our intake of three things: trans fat (found in junk food and animal foods – See Trans Fat in Meat and Dairy); saturated fat (found in mostly animal foods); and dietary cholesterol (found exclusively in animal foods). More on lowering LDL in Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. What Dr. Shaper discovered is that heart disease may be a choice. Like cavities. People who lived over 10,000 years before the invention of the toothbrush pretty much had no cavities. Didn’t brush a day in their lives, never flossed, no Listerine, no Waterpik—and yet, no cavities. Why? Because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet! So why do people continue to get cavities when we know they’re preventable though diet? Simple: because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist. As long as people understand the consequences of their actions, as a physician what more can I do? If you’re an adult and decide that the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family, then go for it—I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence (I’ve got a good dental plan!). But what if instead of the plaque on our teeth, we’re talking about the plaque building up in our arteries? Then we’re no longer just talking about scraping tarter. We’re talking life and death. The most likely reason our loved ones will die is heart disease. It’s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live, but we should make our choices consciously, educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions. 	-	Africa,animal fat,animal products,candy,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,cavities,cholesterol,corn,dental health,exercise,fat,fruit,greens,heart disease,heart health,junk food,LDL cholesterol,Lifestyle medicine,medical profession,medications,millet,mortality,mouthwash,oral health,plant protein,plant-based diets,plantains,Pritikin,protein,pumpkin,trans fats,vegans,vegetable protein,vegetables,vegetarians	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-purely-a-question-of-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1787805,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603726/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23045197,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23045196,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2501914/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2378204/?page=1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-purely-a-question-of-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/	
A-235	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/11/04/how-seafood-can-impact-brain-development/	How Seafood Can Impact Brain Development	In my video Fish Intake Associated With Brain Shrinkage, I discussed evidence suggesting that mercury exposure through fish intake during pregnancy may decrease the size of the newborn’s brain. However, just because fish-eating mothers may give birth to children with smaller brains doesn’t necessarily mean their children will grow up with neurological defects. In the video, Mercury vs. Omega-3s for Brain Development, you can see real-time functional MRI scans of teens whose moms ate a lot of seafood when pregnant. Because these kinds of scans can measure brain activity, as opposed to just brain size, we can more accurately determine if exposure to mercury and PCBs affected these kids. You can see an MRI of what a normal brain looks like when you flash a light in someone’s eyes, but the MRI is significantly different for the mercury and PCB exposed brains, suggesting toxicant related damage to the visual centers in brain. (For more on the effect of mercury on teens, see Nerves of Mercury). Fish consumption may also increase the risk of our children being born with epilepsy. So does maternal fish consumption have an effect on how smart our kids turn out? The DHA in fish—a long chain omega 3 fatty acid—is good for brain development, but mercury is bad for brain development. So a group of researchers looked at 33 different fish species to see what the net effect of these compounds would have on children’s IQ. For most fish species, they found that “the adverse effect of mercury on the IQ scores of children exceeded the beneficial effects of DHA.” In fact, so much brainpower may be lost from fish consumption that the United States may actually lose $5 billion in economic productivity every year. For example, if pregnant women ate tuna every day, the DHA would add a few IQ points. But the mercury in that very same tuna would cause so much brain damage that the overall effect of eating tuna while pregnant would be negative, wiping out an average of eight IQ points. The only two fish that were more brain-damaging than tuna were pike and swordfish. At the other end of the spectrum, the brain boosting effect of DHA may trump the brain damaging effects of mercury in salmon by a little less than one IQ point. Unfortunately, IQ only takes into consideration the cognitive damage caused by mercury, not the adverse effects on motor function and attention and behavior deficits. We think that attention span may be particularly vulnerable to developmental mercury exposure, probably due to damage to the frontal lobes of the brain. And the IQ study didn’t take into account the relatively high levels of PCBs in salmon and the accompanying concerns about cancer risk. Sustainability concerns are another wrinkle, as farm-raised salmon are considered a “fish to avoid.” While king mackerel is considered a best choice for sustainability, the mercury levels are so high as to warrant avoiding consumption—exceeding both the FDA and EPA action levels for mercury contamination. But why risk any loss in intelligence at all when pregnant women can get all the DHA they want from microalgae supplements without any of the contaminants? We can then get the brain boost without the brain damage.

A-236	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/30/why-pregnant-women-should-avoid-tuna/	Why Pregnant Women Should Avoid Tuna	All fish contain small amounts of methylmercury, the most toxic form of mercury, and “fish consumption represents the main source of methylmercury exposure.” In my videos Nerves of Mercury and Fish Fog, I discuss how mercury exposure through fish consumption, even within the government’s safety limits, can have adverse neurological and behavioral effects on child development. Severe exposure can cause overt structural brain abnormalities like microcephaly, a shrunken brain disorder. But we didn’t know whether low exposure could also affect brain size until recently. Autopsy studies suggest mercury preferentially affects the developing cerebellum, so researchers used ultrasound to measure cerebellum size in newborns of mothers who had high body levels of mercury. Let’s put those levels into practical terms. In the video, Fish Intake Associated with Brain Shrinkage, you can see the results of a study measuring mercury concentration in human hair. Just one can of tuna a week raises human hair mercury concentration to levels nearly three times as high as the “high” group in the ultrasound study. So the bodies of the women suffering high mercury contamination were considered heavily contaminated, but even just a little canned tuna once in a while could bump our levels even higher. So the high really wasn’t that high. But what did they find? The researchers demonstrated that babies born to mothers with higher hair mercury levels had cerebellums up to 14% shorter than those born to mothers with lower hair mercury levels. They conclude that prenatal exposure to what may be considered low-levels of methylmercury does indeed influence fetal brain development as evidenced “by decreased size of a newborn’s brain.” But what about the long chain omega-3 DHA in fish—isn’t that necessary for healthy brain development? That’s the topic of my video Mercury vs. Omega-3s for Brain Development.

A-237	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/28/how-fatty-foods-may-affect-our-love-life/	How Fatty Foods May Affect Our Love Life	The food industry, like the tobacco companies and other drug lords, has been able to come up with products that tap into the same dopamine reward system that keeps people smoking cigarettes, using marijuana, and eating candy bars (See Are Sugary Foods Addictive?). New research, highlighted in my video Are Fatty Foods Addictive? suggests that fat may have similar effects on the brain. If people are fed yogurt packed with butter fat, within 30 minutes they exhibit the same brain activity as those who just drank sugar water. People who regularly eat ice cream (sugar and fat) have a deadened dopamine response in their brains in response to drinking a milkshake. It’s similar to when drug abusers have to use more and more to get the same high. Frequent ice cream consumption “is related to a reduction in reward-region (pleasure center) responsivity in humans, paralleling the tolerance observed in drug addiction.” Once we’ve so dulled our dopamine response, we may subsequently overeat in an effort to achieve the degree of satisfaction experienced previously, contributing to unhealthy weight gain. What do fatty and sugary foods have in common? They are energy-dense. It may be less about the number of calories than their concentration. Consumption of a calorie-dilute diet doesn’t lead to deadened dopamine responsivity, but a calorie-dense diet with the same number of calories does. It’s like the difference between cocaine and crack: same stuff chemically, but by smoking crack cocaine we can deliver a higher dose quicker to our brain. As an aside, I found it interesting that the control drink in these milkshake studies wasn’t just water. They can’t use water because our brain actually tastes water on the tongue (who knew!). So instead the researchers had people drink a solution “designed to mimic the natural taste of saliva.” Ew! Anyway, with this new understanding of the neural correlates of food addiction, there have been calls to include obesity as an official mental disorder. After all, both obesity and addiction share the inability to restrain behavior in spite of an awareness of detrimental health consequences, one of the defining criteria of substance abuse. We keep putting crap in our bodies despite the knowledge that we have a problem that is likely caused by the crap, yet we can’t stop (a phenomena called the “pleasure trap”). Redefining obesity as an addiction, a psychiatric disease, would be a boon to the drug companies that are already working on a whole bunch of drugs to muck with our brain chemistry. For example, subjects given an opiate blocker (like what’s done for people with heroin overdoses to block the effects of the drug) eat significantly less cheese — it just doesn’t do as much for them anymore when their opiate receptors are blocked. Rather than taking drugs, though, we can prevent the deadening of our pleasure center in the first place by sticking to foods that are naturally calorically dilute, like whole plant foods. This can help bring back our dopamine sensitivity such that we can again derive the same pleasure from the simplest of foods (see Changing Our Taste Buds). And this is not just for people who are obese. When we regularly eat calorie dense animal and junk foods like ice cream, we can blunt our pleasure so that we may overeat to compensate. When our brain down-regulates dopamine receptors to deal with all these jolts of fat and sugar, we may experience less enjoyment from other activities as well. That’s why cocaine addicts may have an impaired neurological capacity to enjoy sex, and why smokers have an impaired ability to respond to positive stimuli. Since these all involve the same dopamine pathways, what we put into our body—what we eat—can affect how we experience all of life’s pleasures. So to live life to the fullest, what should we do? The food industry, according to some addiction specialists, “should be given incentives to develop low calorie foods that are more attractive, palatable and affordable so that people can adhere to diet programs for a long time.” No need! Mother Nature beat them to it–that’s what the produce aisle is for. By starting to eat healthfully, we can actually change how things taste. Healthiest means whole plant foods, which tend to be naturally dilute given their water and fiber content. Not only is fiber also calorie-free, but one might think of it as having “negative” calories, given the fermentation of fiber in our bowel into anti-obesity compounds (as well as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer compounds). For this reason, those eating plant-based diets eat hundreds of fewer calories without even trying.

A-238	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/23/can-one-become-a-sugar-addict/	Can One Become a Sugar Addict?	People have chewed coca leaves for at least 8,000 years as a mild stimulant without any evidence of addiction, but when certain components are isolated and concentrated into cocaine, we’ve got a problem. The same may be true of sugar—people don’t tend to binge on bananas. The isolation of sugar from the whole food may be the reason we’re more likely to supersize soda than sweet potatoes, or why we’re less likely to eat too much corn on the cob, but can’t seem to get enough high fructose corn syrup. The overconsumption of sugar-sweetened diets has often been compared to drug addiction. However, until very recently this parallel was based more on anecdotal evidence than on solid scientific grounds. But now we have PET scans, imaging technology that can measure brain activity. It all started with a publication from the Institute of Clinical Physiology that showed decreased dopamine sensitivity in obese individuals. The heavier they were, the less responsive to dopamine they appeared to be. We see the same reduction in sensitivity in cocaine addicts and alcoholics, which “would suggest that a reduction in dopamine receptors is associated with addictive behavior irrespective of whether it is due to food or to addictive drugs, as seen in substance abusers.” Dopamine is considered the neurotransmitter primarily involved in the pleasure and reward center of our brain, helping to motivate our drive for things like food, water and sex—all necessary for the perpetuation of our species. It was healthy and adaptive for our primate brains to drive us to eat that banana when there wasn’t much food around. But now that fruit is in fruit loop form, this adaptation has “become a dangerous liability.” The original Coca-Cola formulation actually included coca leaf, but now, perhaps, its sugar content may be the addictive stand-in. What about artificial sweeteners? Though some are less harmful than others (Erythritol May Be a Sweet Antioxidant as opposed to Aspartame-Induced Fibromyalgia), they could still have adverse effects regardless of their individual chemistry. See my 3-part series: What about fatty foods like meat? Does fat have addictive qualities as well? Good question!

A-239	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/21/where-are-phosphate-additives-found/	Where are Phosphate Additives Found?	In my videos Phosphate Additives in Meat Purge and Cola and Phosphate Additives in Chicken, I talked about the danger of phosphate and phosphate additives, and how phosphates are often added to chicken and turkey to help preserve the meat. But how often is poultry injected with phosphates? The vast majority of chicken products (more than 90%) were found to contain these additives. However, most packages did not list the additives on their label. Sometimes they call the phosphate additives “flavorings” or “broth,” and sometimes the labels don’t say anything at all. In the video, How to Avoid Phosphate Additives, you can see the different ways phosphate additives have been listed (if they are listed at all) on ingredient labels. I’d recommend minimizing one’s intake of anything with the four letters: “phos”. These additives are also used in junk foods and fast food. Some products have phosphorus and aluminum additives. We see this a lot in processed cheeses. One grilled cheese sandwich may exceed the World Health Organization’s provisional tolerable daily intake of aluminum by 428%. (I’ve previously touched on the aluminum in cheese in Aluminum in Vaccines vs. Food). More concerning, though, are the levels of lead in some venison (Filled Full of Lead) and mercury in tuna (The Effect of Canned Tuna on Future Wages). The food industry no longer has to list phosphorus content on the nutrition facts label. There have been calls from the public health community to mandate that phosphorus content of foods be included back on the nutrition facts label, but I’m not holding my breath. All these studies bring home the same strong message, “phosphorus-containing additives are present in most meat products and significantly increase the phosphorus content. Moreover, the lack of this information in the Nutrition Facts labels and even in nutrition databases prevents patients and dietitians from accurately estimating the phosphorus content of their food and their daily intake.” 	-	aluminum,animal products,cheese,chicken,dairy,fast food,food additives,industry influence,junk food,meat,poultry,preservatives,processed foods,processed meat,turkey,World Health Organization	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/filled-full-of-lead/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aluminum-in-vaccines-vs-food/	http://www.jrnjournal.org/article/S1051-2276%2805%2900119-6/abstract,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21535864,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/filled-full-of-lead/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12753675,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17720105,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aluminum-in-vaccines-vs-food/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phosphate-additives-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-phosphate-additives/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376617,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-240	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/16/phosphate-additives-in-chicken-banned-elsewhere/	Phosphate Additives in Chicken Banned Elsewhere	In my video Phosphate Additives in Meat Purge and Cola, I talked about the danger of phosphorus additives in food. However, when surveyed, most future medical professionals were insufficiently aware—in fact, two-thirds had no clue—of the risks related to prolonged high dietary phosphate intake. Even if they knew it was a problem, they didn’t know which foods had added phosphates. 99% knew that sugar was added to soda, but only 7% knew that phosphates were added. I bet even fewer knew that it’s injected into most packages of meat. Though this practice remains banned in Europe, 11 different phosphate salts are currently allowed to be injected into meat and poultry in the United States. This despite the fact that phosphate is considered an arterial toxin—causing our arteries to stiffen up within just two hours of consumption. Phosphate additives may also make poultry more dangerous from a food safety standpoint. Phosphate additives may increase the number of Campylobacter bacteria in chicken exudates. Chicken exudate is the same as poultry purge (colloquially known as chicken “juice”), “the fluid that seeps out from processed poultry carcasses and is often found to be contaminated with considerable numbers of Campylobacter bacteria. It is comprised of water, blood, fats, and other materials added to the poultry during processing.” If chicken isn’t injected with phosphate, the exudates seeping into the package may grow about 100 Campylobacter bacteria. But, add some phosphate to the carcass, and up to a hundred million bacteria may grow. Why does adding phosphate to poultry increase the number of Campylobacter bacteria? It may be because phosphates increase the survival of Campylobacter—by 100 fold or more. The infectious dose for Campylobacter has been shown to be as little as 500 organisms. How much might there be in chicken? 100,000 can be easily recovered from washes of whole chicken carcasses. So what does a million times more food-poisoning bacteria mean for the risk to consumers? A mere hundred fold increase in these fecal matter bacteria can mean a thirty fold difference in the number of human outbreaks of Campylobacter, which can leave patients paralyzed (see my video Poultry and Paralysis). But, if the poultry industry doesn’t add phosphates, how are they (in their words) going to “enhance the moisture absorbance, color, and flavor of the meat and reduce product shrinkage?” Other concerning additives used by the meat industry include asthma-type drugs (Ractopamine in Pork), bacteria-eating viruses (Viral Meat Spray), larvae (Maggot Meat Spray), Arsenic in Chicken, nitrosamines (Prevention Is Better Than Cured Meat), and antibiotics (Drug Residues in Meat). Since phosphate additives don’t have to be listed on the nutrition label, how do we avoid them?

A-241	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/14/what-do-meat-purge-and-cola-have-in-common/	What Do Meat Purge and Cola Have in Common?	In my video, Treating Kidney Failure Through Diet, I profiled research suggesting that the use of a plant-based diet for patients with kidney failure would be beneficial. An important function of our kidneys is to filter out excess phosphorus from our bloodstream, so a decline in kidney function can lead to the build-up of phosphorus in our bodies. This in turn can cause something called metastatic calcification, where our heart valves and muscles and other parts of the body can buildup mineral deposits, eventually potentially resulting in bad things like skin necrosis, gangrene, and amputations. Therefore, controlling dietary phosphorus intake is the lynchpin of successful prevention of metastatic calcification. While both plant foods and animal foods have phosphorus, our bodies seem better able to handle phosphorus excretion from plants, so a plant-based diet may help protect against this dreadful condition. However, we’re beginning to realize that absorbing too much phosphorus isn’t good for anyone, even those with healthy kidneys. Having high levels in our blood has been found to be an independent predictor of heart attacks and mortality in the general population, increasing the risk not only of kidney failure, but also of heart failure, heart attacks, coronary death, and overall death. Dietary intake of phosphate is an important matter not just for persons with kidney disease, but for everybody. It’s thought to cause damage to blood vessels, to accelerate the aging process, and even, potentially, to hurt our bones by contributing to osteoporosis via a disruption of hormonal regulation. The estimated average requirement of phosphorus is less than 600 mg a day, but the estimated average intake in the United States is nearly twice that. How do we stay away from too much of the stuff? In the video, Phosphate Additives in Meat Purge and Cola, we can see the different levels of phosphorus in different foods. It looks like many plant foods have as much phosphorus as many animal foods. So why are plant-based diets so effective in treating kidney failure patients? Because most of the phosphorus in plant foods is found in the form of phytic acid, which we can’t digest. Therefore, while plant and animal foods may have similar phosphate contents, the amount that is bioavailable differs. In plant foods, the bioavailability of phosphates is usually less than 50%, while the bioavailability of most animal products is up around 75%. So when we adjust for how much actually gets into our system, plant foods are significantly better. It’s like the absorption of heme and non-heme iron: our bodies can protect themselves from absorbing too much plant-based iron, but can’t stop excess muscle and blood-based (heme) iron from animals slipping through the intestinal wall (see my video Risk Associated With Iron Supplements). The worst kind of phosphorus is in the form of phosphate additives (which are absorbed nearly 100%) that are added, for example, to cola drinks. Why is phosphate added to cola? Without the added phosphate, so many glycotoxins would be produced that the beverage would turn pitch black (see my video on Glycotoxins). Thus, cola drinks owe their brown color to phosphate. Phosphate additives play an especially important role in the meat industry, where they are used as preservatives for the same reason: to enhance a meat product’s color. Just like the dairy industry adds aluminum to cheese, the meat and poultry industries “enhance” their products by injecting them with phosphates. If one looks at meat industry trade journals and can get past all the macabre ads for “head dropping robots for the kill floor,” you’ll see all ad after ad for injection machines. Why? Because of “increased profitability.” Enhanced meats have better color and less “purge.” Purge is a term used to describe the liquid that seeps from flesh as it ages. Many consumers find this unattractive, so the industry views phosphate injection as a win-win. When chicken is injected with phosphates, the “consumer benefits through the perception of enhanced quality,” and the processor benefits from increased yield because they just pump it up with water and they sell it by the pound. The problem is that it can boost phosphorus levels in meat nearly 70%, a “real and insidious danger” not only for kidney patients, but for us all. Another toxic addition to alter the color of meat is arsenic-containing drugs fed directly to chickens (see my video Arsenic in Chicken). Carbon monoxide is used to keep red meat red, anthoxanthins keep salmon pink (Artificial Coloring in Fish) and titanium dioxide is used to whiten processed foods (Titanium Dioxide & Inflammatory Bowel Disease). I’m amazed by the risks the food industry will take to alter food cosmetically (more on this in Artificial Food Colors and ADHD). There are other harmful additives in soda as well (Is Sodium Benzoate Harmful? and Diet Soda and Preterm Birth). What else is in poultry purge (chicken “juice”)?

A-242	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/09/what-to-eat-to-reduce-our-toxic-exposure/	What to Eat to Reduce Our Toxic Exposure	It is not very common that a single molecule attracts enough interest to merit international scientific conferences of its own. “Ah receptor,” however, “belongs to the rare elite of such molecules.” Ah receptors are an important factor in how our immune system works. For background, see my video, The Broccoli Receptor: Our First Line of Defense. The latest conference offered “new reports about the way plant-derived compounds in our diet are necessary for a fully functioning immune system of the gut.” One study in particular out of the journal Nature, “expanded our understanding of how diet impacts immunity and health by showing that a plant-derived nutrient profoundly shapes the capacity for intestinal immune defense.” And intestinal defense not only protects us against the pathogens we may ingest, but also against toxic chemicals. We’re constantly exposed to a wide range of toxins, from such sources as cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes, furnace gases, cooked meat and fish, cow’s milk, and even mother’s milk (because of what mothers themselves are exposed to) as seen in my video Counteracting the Effects of Dioxins Through Diet. Many of these pollutants exert their toxic effects through the Ah receptor system. For example, dioxins invade the body mainly through the diet (where we get more than 90% of our exposure) as it concentrates through the food chain, presenting a serious health concern. But there are phytonutrients in fruits, vegetables, tea, red wine, and beans that block the effects of dioxins at levels close to what we find in people’s bloodstream. Just three apples or about a tablespoon of red onion a day may cut dioxin toxicity in half. And the half-life of these phytonutrients in the body is only about 25 hours, so we have to keep eating these health-promoting foods day after day. At first we just thought that it was only cruciferous vegetables that could dock in these receptors and fend off toxins, but does that make evolutionary sense? As Lora V. Hooper from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute notes, “Given the variety and flexibility of most mammalian diets, a specific dependence on cruciferous vegetables for optimal intestinal immune function would seem overly restrictive. Rather, it seems likely that many other foods contain compounds with similar immune-stimulatory properties.” Indeed, “the search for foods containing similar immunomodulatory compounds has begun.” We now know that a wide variety of natural plant compounds can counteract the chemical pollution to which we’re all exposed. There is actually one animal product that has also been shown to potentially block the cancer-causing effects of dioxins: camel urine. Camel urine—but not cow urine—was found to inhibit the effects of a known carcinogenic chemical. Importantly, the researchers emphasize that virgin camel urine showed the highest degree of inhibition, performing better than pregnant camel urine, for example. So the next time our kids don’t want to eat their fruits and veggies, we can just say, “It’s either that, or camel pee.” I report different mechanisms but similar outcomes in Plants vs. Pesticides and Eating Green to Prevent Cancer. So this all suggests a double benefit of eating lower on the food chain, since it would also entail lower exposure to toxic contaminants in the first place (Industrial Pollutants in Vegans). 	-	animal products,apples,beans,beef,breastfeeding,broccoli,cancer,chicken,cruciferous vegetables,dairy,dioxins,fish,fruit,immune function,industrial toxins,meat,onions,phytonutrients,plant-based diets,pork,poultry,red wine,seafood,smoking,tea,turkey,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,wine	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/14/how-chemically-contaminated-are-we/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-green-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/14/how-chemically-contaminated-are-we/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-broccoli-receptor-our-first-line-of-defense-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22036556,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/counteracting-the-effects-of-dioxins-through-diet/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20883769,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12929624,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22076557,http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcibr1113158,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%ef%bb%bfcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10913616,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-green-to-prevent-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22371237,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/	
A-243	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/07/our-immune-system-uses-plants-to-activate-gut-protection/	Our Immune System Uses Plants To Activate Gut Protection	It might seem that our skin is the first line of defense between our insides and the outside world, but our greatest interface with our environment is actually through the lining of our intestines, which covers thousands of square feet. And all that separates our gut from the outer world is a single layer of cells, 50 millionth of a meter thick – less than the thickness of a sheet of paper. Compare that to our skin. In the video, The Broccoli Receptor: Our First Line of Defense, you can see a layer of skin, dozens of protective cells thick, to keep the outside world outside of our bodies. Why don’t we have multiple layers in our gut wall? Because we need to absorb stuff from food into our body. It’s a good idea for our skin to be waterproof, so we don’t start leaking, but the lining of our gut has to allow for the absorption of fluids and nutrients. With such a thin, fragile layer between our sterile core and outer chaos, we better have quite a defense system in place. Indeed, that’s where “intraepithelial lymphocytes” come in. Intraepithelial lymphocytes serve two functions: they condition and repair that thin barrier, and they provide a front-line defense against intestinal pathogens. These critical cells are covered with Ah receptors. Ah receptors are like locks, and for decades researchers have been searching for a natural key to fit in these locks to activate those receptors and sustain our immunity. We recently discovered a key: broccoli. Cruciferous vegetables—broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts—contain a phytonutrient that is transformed by our stomach acid into the key that fits into the Ah receptor, stimulating our intraepithelial lymphocytes. In other words, broccoli leads to the activation of our immune foot soldiers. In an editorial about Ah receptors and diet, researcher Lora V. Hooper from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute noted, “From childhood we learn that vegetables are good for us, and most of us eat our veggies without giving much thought to the evidence behind this accepted wisdom or to the mechanisms underlying the purported health-boosting properties of a vegetable-rich diet.” But now we know that “specific dietary compounds found at high levels in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage are essential for sustaining intestinal immune function.” Green vegetables are in fact required to maintain a large population of those protective intraepithelial lymphocytes. Maybe that’s why vegetable intake is associated with lower risk of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, whereas the more meaty Western diet is associated with higher risk of inflammatory bowel diseases. This may be because the activating receptors on our intestinal immune cells are basically sensors of plant-derived phytochemicals. This raises a broader question: Why did our immune system evolve this requirement for broccoli and other plant foods? Well, when do we need to boost our intestinal defenses the most? When we eat! That’s when we may be ingesting pathogens. Linking heightened intestinal immune activation to food intake could serve to bolster immunity precisely when it is needed. At the same time, this would allow energy to be conserved in times of food scarcity, since maintaining these defenses takes considerable amounts of energy. Why remain at red alert 24 hours a day when we eat only a couple of times a day? We evolved for millions of years eating mostly weeds—wild plants, dark green leafy vegetables (or as they were known back then, leaves). By using veggies as a signal to upkeep our immune system, our bodies may be bolstering our immune defenses when we most need them. Thus, the old recommendation to “eat your veggies” has a strong molecular basis. (Did we really evolve eating that many plant foods? See my video Paleolithic Lessons). This discovery has been all exciting for the drug companies who are looking into Ah receptor active pharmaceuticals. “However,” as one research team at Cambridge concluded, “rather than developing additional anti-inflammatory drugs, changing diets which are currently highly processed and low in vegetable content, may be a more cost effective way towards health and well-being.” As remarkable as this story is, it is just the tip of the cruciferous iceberg! See, for example: How else can we protect our immune function? Exercise (Preserving Immune Function In Athletes With Nutritional Yeast) and sleep (Sleep & Immunity)! Given the variety and flexibility of most mammalian diets, a specific dependence on cruciferous vegetables for optimal intestinal immune function would seem overly restrictive, no?

A-244	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/10/02/dr-greger-addresses-gmos-in-new-dvd/	Dr. Greger Addresses GMOs in New DVD	The world’s preeminent scientific journal recently editorialized that we are now swimming in information about genetically modified crops, but that much of that information is wrong—on both sides of the debate. “But a lot of this incorrect information is sophisticated,” they write, “backed by legitimate-sounding research and written with certitude.” When it comes to GMO’s, they quip, “a good gauge of a statement’s fallacy is the conviction with which it is delivered.” With USDA’s approval this month of Dow Chemical’s commercialization of a new round of GMO crops, it’s more important than ever to assess the human health implications of genetically engineered foods. Any time there’s billions of dollars at stake, combined with flaring political ideologies, it’s hard to know who to trust. So as always, best to stick to the science. This is easier said than done, though–more than 41,000 papers have been published on GMOs in the medical literature, totaling a couple hundred million words. But that’s what you have me for! I live in the library so you don’t have to. Reviewing all the primary sources I could find on the public health implications of GMO crops I created four new videos: They are all available right now as a video download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 21 (all proceeds go to this charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD. The GMO videos are all scheduled to go up on NutritionFacts.org by mid-November, but you can download and watch them right now. The current batch of videos from volume 20 on NutritionFacts.org just ran out, so starting this month and running through December, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 21. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–40+ hours of video–you can get the complete DVD collection. Here’s the list of chapters from the new volume 21 DVD — a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org: Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads. If you were a regular supporter, you’d already be a GMO expert by now, having gotten the new DVD two weeks ago! I now come out with DVDs at an exhausting pace–a new one every 9 weeks. If you’d like to automatically receive them before they’re even available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor. Anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both–your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs. If you’re already signed up and didn’t receive your volume 21 yet, please email Tommasina@NutritionFacts.org and she’ll make everything all better.

A-245	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/25/are-canned-beans-as-healthy-as-home-cooked/	Are Canned Beans as Healthy as Home-Cooked?	Beans are an essential part of any healthful diet. The federal government recommends about half a cup a day of beans, counting them as both a protein and a vegetable since they have the best of both worlds. Beans are excellent sources of fiber, folate, plant protein, plant iron, vitamin B1, and minerals such as magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and copper, all while being naturally low in sodium. Yet Americans don’t know beans! 96% of Americans don’t even meet the measly minimum recommended intake of beans, chickpeas, split peas or lentils. The same percentage of Americans don’t eat their greens every day. Two of the healthiest foods on the planet are greens and beans, but hardly anyone even consumes the minimum recommended amount. As a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute noted, this is just another “piece added to the rather disturbing picture that is emerging of a nation’s diet in crisis.” But how should we get our beans? Canned beans are convenient, but are they as nutritious as home-cooked? And if we do used canned, should we drain them or not? A recent study published in Food and Nutrition Sciences spilled the beans. In addition to their health benefits, beans are cheap. The researchers did a little bean counting, and a serving of beans costs between ten cents and, if we want to go crazy, 40 cents. The researchers compiled a table, which you can see in my video, Canned Beans or Cooked Beans?, of the cost per serving of beans, both canned and cooked. Canned beans cost about three times more than dried beans, but dried beans can take hours to cook, so my family splurges on canned beans, paying the extra 20 cents a serving. Nutrition-wise, cooked and canned are about the same, but the sodium content of canned beans can be 100 times that of cooked. Draining and rinsing the canned beans can get rid of about half the sodium, but you’re also draining and rinsing away some of the nutrition.  I recommend, when buying canned beans, to instead get the no-salt added varieties, and to keep and use the bean juice. The bottom line is that beans, regardless of type or form, are a nutrient rich food and should be encouraged as part of an overall healthy diet. Concerned about gas?

A-246	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/23/will-the-real-paleo-diet-please-stand-up/	Will The Real Paleo Diet Please Stand Up?	Paleolithic diets are currently the rage, attracting athletes, dieters, and health seekers of all stripes. The basic premise of the so-called “paleo” diet is simple—the diet humans ate in preagricultural, Paleolithic times is best suited for human health. Whether or not what these relatively short-lived humans ate is what’s optimal for the health of today’s relatively long-lived humans is a matter of considerable debate. Preagricultural diets—which essentially consisted of wild plants, wild animals, and wild fish—varied considerably, depending on location, season, hunting and gathering skills, available tools, and so on. People didn’t consume oil, sugar, or salt; anything from a box or bag, or the milk of other mammals. Today’s new paleo devotees attempt to copy this diet by eating meat, poultry, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds and avoiding processed foods, grains, legumes, and dairy products. Followers of the new paleo diet naturally assume that their nutrient intakes approximate that of Paleolithic humans, but their actual intakes may be wide of the mark. Nutritional anthropologists have been estimating the nutrient intakes of cavemen for several decades. As it turns out, vegan diets may actually come closer to matching the macro- and micronutrient intakes of Paleolithic diets than new paleo diets. The table below summarizes the results of a comparison among recommended paleo menus, recommended plant-based menus, and a true Paleolithic diet eaten by early humans. The data compare three days of recommended paleo menus from a popular paleo website, three days of recommended plant-based (vegan) menus from Becoming Vegan: Comprehensive Edition, and the estimated average daily intakes of Paleolithic people. The table also provides dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for adult males (M) and adult females (F) who aren’t pregnant or lactating. Nutrients and other dietary factors in the new paleo or vegan diet that are more similar to the true Paleolithic diet are highlighted (pink for the new paleo diet and green for the vegan diet).

A-247	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/18/can-eating-soy-prevent-breast-cancer/	Can Eating Soy Prevent Breast Cancer?	In my video, Increased Lifespan From Beans, I discuss how beans may be the single most important dietary predictor of a long lifespan. But why do people who eat legumes such as beans, chickpeas, split peas, and lentils live longer? It may be because men and women who eat legumes have been shown to be lighter, have a slimmer waist, lower blood pressure, lower blood sugars, lower cholesterol, lower triglycerides, and better kidney function. Interestingly, bean intake is a better protector against mortality in women than in men. This may be because cancer—especially breast cancer—was the leading killer of women in the population studied. Breast cancer survivors who eat soy foods, for example, have a significantly lower likelihood of cancer recurrence. A 2012 review looked at the three studies done to date on the link between soy and breast cancer survival. It showed that women who ate the most soy had a 29% lower risk of dying from breast cancer and a 36% lower risk of cancer recurrence. A fourth study has since been published that reaffirms these results. With an average intake of soy phytonutrients above 17 mg/day—the amount found in about a cup of soymilk—the mortality of breast cancer may be reduced by as much as 38%. In my video, BRCA Breast Cancer Genes and Soy, you can see a five-year survival curve for Chinese women with breast cancer. After two years, all of the breast cancer survivors that ate lots of soy were still alive, while only about two-thirds of the women who ate the least amount of soy were alive. After five years, 90% of the tofu lovers were still alive and kicking, whereas half of the tofu haters had kicked the bucket. There is a similar relationship between breast cancer survival and soy protein intake, as opposed to just soy phytonutrient intake. How does soy so dramatically decrease cancer risk and improve survival? Soy may actually help turn back on women’s BRCA genes. BRCA is a so-called “caretaker gene,” an oncosuppressor (cancer-suppressing) gene responsible for DNA repair. Mutations in this gene can cause a rare form of hereditary breast cancer, popularized by Angelina Jolie’s public decision to undergo a preventive double mastectomy. But only about 5% of breast cancers run in families; 95% of breast cancer victims have fully functional BRCA genes. So if their DNA repair mechanisms are intact, how did breast cancer form, grow, and spread? It does so by suppressing the expression of the gene through a process called methylation. The gene’s fine, but cancer found a way to turn it down or even off, potentially facilitating the metastatic spread of the tumor. And that’s where soy may come in. The reason soy intake is associated with increased survival and decreased cancer recurrence may be because the phytonutrients in soy turn back on the BRCA protection, removing the methyl straightjacket the tumor tried to place on it. To find out if this is indeed the case, a group of researchers put it to the test. In the video mentioned earlier, BRCA Breast Cancer Genes and Soy, you can see normal cells side-by-side with three different types of human breast cancer cells, specially stained so that the expression of BRCA genes shows up brown. Column 1 (far left) shows what fully functioning DNA repair looks like—what normal breast cells should look like—lots of brown, lots of BRCA expression. Column 2 shows raging breast cancer cells. If you add soy phytonutrients to the cancer (columns 3 and 4), the BRCA genes get turned back on and DNA repair appears to start ramping back up. Although this was at a pretty hefty dose (equivalent to about a cup of soybeans), the results suggest that treatment with soy phytonutrients might reverse DNA hypermethylation and restore the expression of the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Soy appears to also help with other breast cancer genes as well, and women at increased genetic risk of breast cancer may especially benefit from high soy intake. No matter what genes we inherit, changes in diet can affect DNA expression at a genetic level. No matter what bad genetic cards we’ve been dealt, we can reshuffle the deck with diet. For examples, see: I’ve previously covered the available science in Breast Cancer Survival and Soy. Other effects detailed in: It may be possible to overdo it, though.

A-248	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/16/eat-beans-to-live-longer/	Eat Beans to Live Longer	Beans, beans, they’re good for your heart; the more you eat, the…longer you live? Legumes may be the most important predictor of survival in older people from around the globe. Researchers from different institutions looked at five different cohorts in Japan, Sweden, Greece, and Australia. Of all the food factors they looked at, only one was associated with a longer lifespan across the board: legume intake. Whether it was the Japanese eating their soy, the Swedes eating their brown beans and peas, or those in the Mediterranean eating lentils, chickpeas, and white beans, legume intake was associated with an increased lifespan. In fact, it was the only result that was plausible, consistent, and statistically significant from the data across all the populations combined. We’re talking an 8% reduction in risk of death for every 20 gram increase in daily legume intake. That’s just two tablespoons worth! So if a can of beans is 250 grams, and we get 8% lower mortality for every 20 grams, if we eat a can a day can we live forever? If, however, one wants to decrease their lifespan, studies suggest eating a bean-free diet may increase our risk of death. Having arrived at the one dietary fountain of youth, why aren’t people clamoring for beans? Fear of flatulence. So is that the choice we’re left with: Breaking wind or breaking down? Passing gas or passing on? Turns out that people’s concerns about excessive flatulence from eating beans may be exaggerated. A recent study, profiled in my video Increased Lifespan from Beans, involved adding a half-cup of beans every day to people’s diets for months to see what would happen.  The vast majority of people experienced no symptoms at all. However, a few percent did report increased flatulence, so some individuals may be affected. But most aren’t. Even among those that were affected, 70% or more of the participants felt that flatulence dissipated—no pun intended—by the second or third week of bean consumption.  So we’ve just got to stick with it. And a small percentage reported increased flatulence on the control diet without any beans. People have preconceived notions about beans such that just the expectation of flatulence from eating beans may influence their perceptions of having gas. Researchers didn’t actually measure farts in this study, they just asked participants how much gas they had. We know from previous studies that if someone eats a product that’s labeled to have something that may cause intestinal distress, it causes more intestinal distress—whether it actually contains that ingredient or not! So people thinking beans are going to cause gas may just be more likely to notice the gas they normally have. Either way it tends to go away. After a few weeks of daily bean consumption, people perceive that flatulence occurrence returns to normal levels. In another study, researchers added more than a half a cup of kidney beans to people’s daily diets, and the research subjects reported that the discomfort they initially felt within the first day or two quickly disappeared. We’ve just got to stick with it. The bottom line is that an increasing body of research supports the benefits of a plant-based diet, and legumes specifically, in the reduction of chronic disease risks. In some people, increased bean consumption may result in more flatulence initially, but it will decrease over time if we just keep it up. Doctors should recommend a bean-filled, plant-based diet to their patients, as the nutritional attributes of beans far outweigh the potential for transitory discomfort. The long-term health benefits of bean consumption are great. Eating beans in the long term may make our term on earth even longer.

A-249	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/11/overdosing-on-poppy-seeds/	Overdosing on Poppy Seeds	The opium poppy used to make heroin is the same opium poppy used to make muffins and bagels. Does this mean that poppy seed muffin we may have had for breakfast contained a powerful narcotic? The idea that poppy seeds could serve as the source of appreciable amounts of codeine/morphine was not given much credence despite the existence of an old European custom recommending a poppy-seed-filled pacifier to quiet a noisy baby. It wasn’t given much credence, that is, until a mother tried giving her six-month-old some strained milk she had boiled some poppy seeds in with the very best intentions of helping the child sleep better. It worked a little too well, culminating in respiratory arrest. Now we have governmental warnings that such a practice is not a good idea. The cases aren’t limited to children. Evidently if we eat spaghetti with a half cup of poppy seeds on top, it can make adults a little loopy as well. So what’s the upper limit of poppy seed consumption that’s probably safe? A study profiled in my video, How Many Poppy Seeds is Too Many?, suggests about one teaspoon for every seven pounds of body weight. That means that someone weighing about 150 pounds (70 kilograms) should probably eat no more than seven tablespoons of raw poppy seeds at a time. Cooking may wipe out half of the morphine and codeine, though, so that gives us some more leeway when baking. Soaking the seeds for five minutes first and then discarding the water before adding them to our recipe can eliminate another half if we’re making some poppy seed filled pastry or something for kids. Otherwise, though, there shouldn’t be any risk at usual levels of intake—unless you’re going in for a drug test, in which case you may want to avoid poppy seeds altogether.

A-250	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/09/the-healthiest-diet-for-weight-control/	The Healthiest Diet for Weight Control	We know that vegetarians tend to be slimmer, but there’s a perception that veg diets may somehow be deficient in nutrients. So how’s this for a simple study, profiled in my video Nutrient-Dense Approach to Weight Management: an analysis of the diets of 13,000 people, comparing the nutrient intake of those eating meat to those eating meat-free. They found that those eating vegetarian were getting higher intakes of nearly every nutrient: more fiber, more vitamin A, more vitamin C, more vitamin E, more of the B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, & folate), more calcium, more magnesium, more iron, and more potassium. At the same time, they were also eating less of the harmful stuff like saturated fat and cholesterol. And yes, they got enough protein. And some of those nutrients are the ones Americans really struggle to get enough of—like fiber, vitamins A, C, and E, calcium, magnesium, potassium—and those eating vegetarian got more of all of them. Even so, just because they did better than the standard American diet isn’t saying much—they still didn’t get as much as they should have. Those eating vegetarian ate significantly more dark green leafy vegetables, but that comes out to just two more teaspoons of greens than meat eaters on average every day. In terms of weight management, the vegetarians were consuming, on average, 363 fewer calories every day. That’s what people do when they go on a diet and restrict their food intake—but it seemed like that is how vegetarians just ate normally. How sustainable are more plant-based diets long term? They are among the only type of diet that has been shown to be sustainable long-term, perhaps because not only do people lose weight but they often feel so much better. And there’s no calorie counting or portion control. In fact, vegetarians may burn more calories in their sleep. Those eating more plant-based diets appear to have an 11% higher resting metabolic rate. Both vegetarians and vegans seem to have a naturally revved up metabolism compared to those eating meat. Having said that, the vegetarians in the first study mentioned were also eating eggs and dairy, so while they were significantly slimmer than those eating meat, they were still, on average, overweight. As profiled in my video, Thousands of Vegans Studied, the only dietary pattern associated on average with an ideal body weight was a strictly plant-based one. But at least the study helps to dispel the myth that meat-free diets are somehow nutrient-deficient. In fact, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association asked, “What could be more nutrient dense than a vegetarian diet?” Anyone can lose weight in the short term on nearly any diet, but diets don’t seem to work in the long-term. That’s because we don’t need a “diet”; we need a new way of eating that we can comfortably stick with throughout our lives. If that’s the case, then we better choose to eat in a way that will most healthfully sustain us. That’s why a plant-based diet may offer the best of both worlds. It’s the only diet, for example, shown to reverse heart disease–our number one killer–in the majority of patients, as described in my video: One in a Thousand: Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic. 	-	animal fat,animal products,beef,calcium,calories,chicken,cholesterol,fat,fiber,fish,folate,greens,iron,LDL cholesterol,magnesium,meat,metabolism,plant-based diets,pork,potassium,poultry,protein,riboflavin,saturated fat,seafood,thiamine,turkey,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,vitamin A,vitamin B1,vitamin B12,vitamin C,vitamin E,weight loss	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrient-dense-approach-to-weight-management/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8177051,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144137,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616188,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616193,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616194,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrient-dense-approach-to-weight-management/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-251	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/04/why-athletes-should-eat-nutritional-yeast/	Why Athletes Should Eat Nutritional Yeast	Does powering up at the gym also power up our immune system? Research has shown that moderate exercise improves immunity and decreases illness rates. According to an article in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, “the most important finding that has emerged from exercise immunology studies during the past two decades is that positive changes in our immune system take place during each bout of moderate physical activity. Over time, this translates to fewer days of sickness from, for example, the common cold and other upper respiratory infections.” The best available evidence suggests a 25% to 50% reduction in sick days. Name one drug or supplement that can do that! And it doesn’t take much. Let kids run around for just six minutes and we can boost the number of immune cells circulating in their blood stream by more than a third. At the other end of the life cycle, exercise may help prevent age-related immune decline. Sedentary women in their 70s may have a 50% chance of getting an upper respiratory illness during the fall season every year. But with just a half-hour walk each day, their risk is down to 20%. The runners in the group got it under 10%–five times better! While regular physical activity improves immune function and lowers upper respiratory infection risk, sustained and intense exertion may have the opposite effect, forming a so-called J-shaped curve relationship (you can see this curve diagram in my video, Preserving Immune Function in Athletes With Nutritional Yeast). As we go from inactive to active, our infection risk declines. But if we overtrain, as hardcore athletes do, we may actually put excessive stress on our body and increase our risk of infection. Then we could lose training days, and our performance could suffer. So how can we fight off sickness while continuing to train? Traditional sports medicine doesn’t appear to offer much help, advising athletes to basically not pick their nose, avoid sick people, and get a flu shot. But there may be a natural solution. A new study found that we can better maintain our level of circulating white blood cells after exhaustive exercise by consuming a special type of fiber found in baker’s, brewer’s, and nutritional yeast. (Brewer’s yeast is bitter, but nutritional yeast has a nice cheesy flavor. I use it mostly to sprinkle on popcorn). Normally, two hours after hardcore cycling, there can be a dip in circulating white blood cells, one of our first lines of defense. However, after strenuous exercise, those who ate the equivalent of less than three quarters of a teaspoon a day of nutritional yeast ended up even better than when they started. But does this increase in immune cells translate into fewer illnesses? Researchers studied competitors in the Carlsbad Marathon to find out. In the weeks following the race, a significant number of runners began experiencing upper respiratory tract infection symptoms while taking a placebo. Those runners who were taking the equivalent of a daily spoonful of nutritional yeast cut their rates of infection in half. And they felt better, too. They were asked how they felt on a scale of one to ten. People taking the sugar pills were okay, down around four or five, but those taking identical looking capsules of the fiber found in nutritional yeast were up at six or seven. Elite athletes tend to normally experience deterioration in mood state during intense training periods, and before and after a marathon race. Sprinkle on a little spoonful of nutritional yeast, though, and you may feel less tense, less fatigued, less confused, even less angry (and my personal favorite, they had significantly “increased vigor”). Don’t have time to exercise? Yes you do! See Standing Up for Your Health. Find more on the benefits of exercise in: What else can we do to preserve our immune function?

A-253	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/28/how-to-boost-the-benefits-of-exercise/	How to Boost the Benefits of Exercise	We all know exercise is beneficial to our health. Then why is it that ultramarathon runners may generate so many free radicals during a race that they can damage the DNA of a significant percentage of their cells? Researchers have looked at the exercise-induced increase in free radical production as a paradox: why would an apparently healthy act—exercise—lead to detrimental effects through damage to various molecules and tissues? This arises out of somewhat of a misunderstanding: exercise in and of itself is not necessarily the healthy act—it’s the recovery after exercise that is so healthy, the whole “that-which-doesn’t-kill-us-makes-us-stronger” notion. For example, exercise training has been shown to enhance antioxidant defenses by increasing the activities of our antioxidant enzymes. So, during the race ultra-marathoners may be taking hits to their DNA, but a week later they can experience great benefits, as shown in my video, Enhanced Athletic Recovery Without Undermining Adaptation. In a recent study, researchers from Oregon State University looked at the level of DNA damage in athletes. Six days after a race, athletes didn’t just go back to the baseline level of DNA damage, but had significantly less, presumably because they had revved up their antioxidant defenses. So, maybe exercise-induced oxidative damage is beneficial, similar to vaccination. By freaking out the body a little, we might induce a response that’s favorable in the long run. This concept, that low levels of a damaging entity can up-regulate protective mechanisms, is known as hormesis. For example, herbicides kill plants, but in tiny doses may actually boost plant growth, presumably by stressing the plant into rallying its resources to successfully fight back. Wait a second, though. Could eating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant rich plant foods undermine this adaptation response? We know that berries may reduce inflammatory muscle damage (See Reducing Muscle Soreness with Berries), and greens may reduce free radical DNA damage (See Preventing Exercise Induced Oxidative Stress with Watercress). Dark chocolate and tomato juice appear to have similar effects. How it works is that flavonoid phytonutrients in fruits, vegetables, and beans seem to inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase, considered the main contributor of free radicals during exercise. And the carbs in plant foods may also decrease stress hormone levels. So in 1999, a theoretical concern was raised. Maybe all that free radical stress from exercise is a good thing, and increased consumption of some antioxidant nutrients might interfere with these necessary adaptive processes. If we decrease free radical tissue damage, maybe we won’t get that increase in activity of those antioxidant enzymes. A group of researchers who performed a study on tart cherry juice and recovery following a marathon responded to this antioxidant concern by suggesting that, although it is likely that muscle damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress are important factors in the adaptation process, minimizing these factors may improve recovery so we can train more and perform better. So, there are theories on both sides, but what happens when we actually put it to the test? While antioxidant or anti-inflammatory supplements may prevent these adaptive events, researchers found that blackcurrant extract – although packed with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties – actually boosted the health benefits of regular exercise. If we take antioxidant pills—vitamin C and vitamin E supplements— we can also reduce the stress levels induced by exercise, but in doing so we block that boost in antioxidant enzyme activity caused by exercise. Now maybe we don’t need that boost if we don’t have as much damage, but vitamin C supplements seem to impair physical performance in the first place. With plant foods, though, we appear to get the best of both worlds. For example, lemon verbena, an antioxidant-rich herbal tea, protects against oxidative damage and decreases the signs of muscular damage and inflammation, without blocking the cellular adaptation to exercise. In a recent study, researchers showed that lemon verbena does not affect the increase of the antioxidant enzyme response promoted by exercise. On the contrary: antioxidant enzyme activity was even higher in the lemon verbena group. In my video, Enhanced Athletic Recovery Without Undermining Adaptation, you can see the level of antioxidant enzyme activity before and after 21 days of intense running exercises in the control group. With all that free radical damage, the body started cranking up its antioxidant defenses. But give a dark green leafy tea, and not only do we put a kabosh on the damage due to all the phytonutrients and antioxidants, but we still get the boost in defenses—in fact, in this case, the boost was even greater.

A-254	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/26/chronic-headaches-and-pork-parasites/	Chronic Headaches & Pork Parasites	Neurocysticercosis is the sciencey name for an infection of the human central nervous system by pork tapeworm larvae. The invasion of baby pork tapeworms in the brain “has become an increasingly important emerging infection in the United States,” and is the #1 cause of epilepsy in the world. It is the most common parasitic disease of the human brain and used to be found throughout only the developing world (with the exception of Muslim countries, since less pork is consumed there). That all changed about 30 years ago, and now it’s increasingly found throughout North America. Besides seizures, the pork parasites may actually trigger brain tumors or cause an aneurism or psychiatric manifestation like depression. It can also result in dementia, but with deworming drugs this is often reversible. Only rarely do surgeons have to surgically remove the larvae. I’ve talked about pork tapeworms before (see my videos Pork Tapeworms on the Brain, Avoiding Epilepsy Through Diet, and Not So Delusional Parasitosis). What’s new is that we now know that they may present as chronic headaches—either migraines or so-called “tension-headaches”—even when the worms in our head are dead. What researchers think is happening is that as our body tries to chip away at the worms’ calcified bodies, bits of them may be released into the rest of our brain causing inflammation that could be contributing to headaches. This condition is rare even in endemic areas, but we can avoid getting infested with an adult tapeworm in the first place by cooking pork thoroughly. It’s found in some parts of pig carcasses more than others (see the meat chart here), and the worms can be frozen to death no matter how infested the muscles are by storing pork (cut up into small pieces) for a month at subzero temperatures. Then to ensure the larvae are dead the meat is recommended to be cooked for more than two hours. That’s one well-done pork chop! The New England Journal of Medicine recently featured a case of some guy who must have had thousands of pork tapeworm larvae wriggling through his muscles. In my video, Chronic Headaches and Pork Tapeworms, you can see an x-ray, showing the thousands of little white streaks in this man’s body. Each white streak is a baby tapeworm. That’s why you can get infected by pork, it gets in the muscles. So cannibals might want to cook for two hours too. Not all parasites are associated with meat, though. An anxious but healthy 32-year-old male physician presented to the family medicine clinic with a sample of suspected parasites from his stools, which had been retrieved from the toilet that same day. They looked to be about an inch long. He had previously traveled to India, had Chinese food the night before—who knows what he had. Maybe it was hookworms? The sample was sent to the microbiology laboratory for analysis. Later that day, the microbiology physician called to report positive identification of Vigna radiata (previously known as Phaseolus aureus) in the stool sample. Or in common parlance, a bean sprout. They were bean sprouts! “The patient was called and gently but firmly informed of the diagnosis. Given the nature of the identified specimen, the information was presented in a non-judgmental, respectful manner so as not to offend the sensibilities or sensitivities of the patient.” Their parting advice to fellow physicians in cases of this nature was as follows: “as comical as the findings might seem–try not to laugh!” Other parasites in meat include toxoplasma (Brain Parasites in Meat), sarcosystis (USDA Parasite Game), and Anisakis (Allergenic Fish Worms). There can even be critters in some dairy products (Cheese Mites and Maggots). Eating Outside Our Kingdom describes a brain malady caused not by meat parasites, but by meat proteins themselves.

A-255	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/21/why-the-egg-cancer-link/	Why the Egg-Cancer Link?	Two million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer — but that’s better than dying from prostate cancer. Catch it when it’s localized and the five-year survival is practically guaranteed, but once it really starts spreading, chances drop to one in three. “Thus, identification of modifiable factors that affect the progression of prostate cancer is something that deserves study,” noted Dr. Erin Richman and colleagues at Harvard. So, they took more than a thousand men with early stage prostate cancer and followed them for a couple years to see if there was anything in their diet associated with a resurgence of the cancer, such as spreading to the bone. Compared to men who hardly ate any eggs, men who ate even less than a single egg a day had a significant 2-fold increased risk of prostate cancer progression. The only thing worse was poultry consumption, with up to four times the risk of progression among high-risk men. They think it might be the cooked meat carcinogens that for some reason build up more in chicken and turkey muscle than in other meats. For more on these so-called heterocyclic amines, see my videos: Heterocyclic Amines in Eggs, Cheese, and Creatine?, Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens, and PhIP: The Three Strikes Breast Carcinogen. But what about the eggs? Why would less than once-a-day egg consumption double the risk of cancer progression? “A plausible mechanism that may explain the association between eggs and prostate cancer progression is high dietary choline,” the researchers suggested.  Egg consumption is a determinant of how much choline you have in your blood, and higher blood choline has been associated with a greater risk of getting prostate cancer in the first place. So the choline in eggs may both increase one’s risk of getting it and having it spread. Studies have associated choline consumption not just with getting cancer and spreading cancer, but also with significantly increased risk of dying from it. Those who ate the most had a 70% increased risk of lethal prostate cancer. Another recent study found that men who consumed two and a half or more eggs per week — that’s just like one egg every three days — had an 81 percent increased risk of lethal prostate cancer. Maybe that’s why meat, milk, and eggs have all been associated with advanced prostate cancer—because of the choline. Choline is so concentrated in cancer cells that doctors can follow choline uptake to track the spread of cancer throughout the body. But why may dietary choline increase the risk of lethal prostate cancer? Dietary choline is converted in the gut to trimethylamine (see my video Carnitine, Choline, Cancer and Cholesterol: The TMAO Connection), so the Harvard researchers speculated that the TMAO from the high dietary choline intake may increase inflammation, which may promote progression of prostate cancer to a lethal disease. In one of my videos, Eggs and Choline: Something Fishy, I talked about what trimethylamine might do to one’s body odor. In the New England Journal of Medicine, the same Cleveland Clinic research team that did the famous study on carnitine repeated the study, but instead of feeding people a steak, they fed people some hard-boiled eggs. Just as they suspected, a similar spike in that toxic TMAO. So it’s not just red meat. And the link between TMAO levels in the blood and strokes, heart attacks, and death was seen even in low-risk groups like those with low-risk cholesterol levels. Thus, because of the choline, eating eggs may increase our risk regardless of what our cholesterol is. It’s ironic that the choline content of eggs is something the egg industry actually boasts about. And the industry is aware of the cancer data. Through the Freedom of Information Act, I was able to get my hands on an email (which you can view in my video, Eggs, Choline, and Cancer) from the executive director of the industry’s Egg Nutrition Center to an American Egg Board executive talking about how choline may be a culprit in promoting cancer progression. “Certainly worth keeping in mind,” he said, “as we continue to promote choline as another good reason to consume eggs.”   With regard to the prevention of prostate cancer progression, chicken and eggs may be the worst foods to eat, but what might be the best? See my video Prostate Cancer Survival: The A/V Ratio. To prevent prostate cancer in the first place, see videos such as: What about reversing cancer progression? See Dr. Ornish’s work Cancer Reversal Through Diet?, followed up by the Pritikin Foundation: Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay.

A-256	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/19/how-eggs-can-impact-body-odor/	How Eggs Can Impact Body Odor	I previously lampooned the egg industry PR campaign that tried to promote eggs as a source of eyesight-saving nutrients such as lutein, by noting that a single spoonful of spinach had as much as nine eggs (see Egg Industry Blind Spot). The reason we’ll only hear that egg industry claim on websites and TV shows, and never in an ad or on an egg carton, is because there are laws against false and misleading advertising that don’t allow the industry to say eggs contain lutein because there’s such an insignificant amount. In an email I retrieved through the Freedom of Information Act (you can see the email in my video Eggs and Choline: Something Fishy), the head of the USDA’s poultry research and promotion programs reminded the egg industry that they can’t mention lutein in an egg ad. They can’t say it helps people with macular degeneration, and can’t even talk about how good lutein is for us since “eggs have such a wee amount, and given eggs’ fat and cholesterol content this is a nonstarter for anything but PR.” So for public relations, companies can lie through your teeth, but there are laws covering truthfulness in ads. The industry can’t say eggs are a source of omega 3s, iron, or folate either. They can’t even honestly call eggs a rich source of protein. The USDA Agriculture Marketing Service suggested that the egg industry instead boast about the choline content of eggs, one of only two nutrients that eggs are actually rich in, besides cholesterol. So the egg industry switched gears. A priority objective of the American Egg Board became “to make choline out to be an urgent problem and eggs the solution.” They outlined how they could partner with a physician’s group and write an “advertorial.” They developed a number of them for nutrition journals. An advertorial is an advertisement parading as an objective editorial. They sent letters out to doctors arguing that “inadequate intake of choline has tremendous public health implications.” So forget about the cholesterol—the “elephant-in-the-room,” as the industry calls it—and focus on this conjured epidemic of choline deficiency. People actually get about twice the choline they need and, in fact, too much choline can be the real problem. For one thing, too much choline can give breath, urine, sweat, saliva, and vaginal secretions an odor resembling rotten fish. Millions of Americans have a genetic defect that causes a fishy body odor and might benefit from a low-choline diet, since choline is converted in our gut into the fishy compound trimethylamine (TMA). Individuals oozing trimethylamine often become vegans because reducing the ingestion of dietary animal products rich in lipids decreases TMA production and the associated noxious odor. The other 99 percent of us, though, can turn the fishy choline compound into trimethylamine oxide, which is 100 times less stinky. We used to think extra choline was harmless for the 99 percent, but not anymore. Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic found that dietary choline (after it is converted in our gut to trimethylamine and oxidized in our liver to form trimethylamine oxide) may contribute to plaque build-up in people’s arteries. This may set us up for heart disease, stroke, and death. Which foods is choline predominantly found in? Eggs, milk, liver, red meat, poultry and fish. The good news is that this may mean a new approach to prevent or treat heart disease, the most obvious of which would be to limit dietary choline intake. But if that means decreasing egg, meat and dairy consumption, then the new approach sounds an awful lot like the old approach – adopting a plant-based diet. Choline may be one of the reasons people following the Atkins diet are at increased risk of heart disease whereas a more plant-based diet like Ornish’s can instead reverse our number one killer (see Low Carb Diets and Coronary Blood Flow). This new research adds choline to the list of dietary culprits with the potential to increase the risk of heart disease, making eggs a double whammy—the most concentrated common source of both choline and cholesterol. I previously did a more in depth dive into the choline issue in Carnitine, Choline, Cancer and Cholesterol: The TMAO Connection.

A-257	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/14/how-the-meat-industry-designed-a-highly-misleading-study/	How to Design a Misleading Study	Imagine working for the now defunct Twinkie division of Hostess and wanting to take the tobacco industry tact of not just downplaying the risk of your product, but actually promoting it as healthy. How would we do that? Our first problem is that each Twinkie has 2.5 grams of saturated fat, which raises cholesterol, the #1 risk factor of our #1 killer, heart disease. How are we going to get around that? Well, what if we designed a study in which we took a bunch of people eating our arch-rival, Little Debbie cloud cakes. Now they only have one gram each, so what if we took a group eating five cloud cakes a day — five grams of saturated fat — and then cut that saturated fat intake in half by switching them to eating one Twinkie a day. What would happen to their cholesterol levels? Their cholesterol would go down due to their decreased saturated fat consumption. So even though they went from eating five cakes down to one, technically, they went from zero Twinkies a day to one Twinkie a day, and their cholesterol went down (we wouldn’t mention the five to one thing). We publish it and crank out a press release, “New research shows that eating a Twinkie a day can be good for heart health by improving cholesterol levels.” The media takes our press release and runs with it: “Consumers can eat a Twinkie every day if they choose, and feel confident that science supports Twinkies’ healthy benefits, which now include cholesterol-lowering effects!” Twinkies, we just proved with science, have cholesterol-lowering effects. Too outlandish a scenario? Amazingly, that’s exactly what the beef industry did (those above quotes are actual quotes–just replace the word beef for Twinkie). In a study bought and paid for by the beef industry, beef was added to people’s diets. At the same time, the subjects removed so much poultry, pork, fish, and cheese from their diet that they halved their saturated fat intake from 12 percent of their diet, down to 6 percent of their diet, causing their cholesterol levels to go down. If our diet goes from 12 percent saturated fat down to 6 percent saturated fat, it doesn’t matter if that 6 percent comes from beef, chicken, lard, or Twinkies. If we cut our total saturated fat in half, our cholesterol will follow, especially if we eat more fiber and vegetable protein as they did in the study. The researchers conclude: “The results of the BOLD study [standing for Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet] provide convincing evidence that lean beef can be included in a heart-healthy diet that meets current dietary recommendations and reduces cardiovascular disease risk.” Crisco could be included. Krispy Crème could be included, as long as we cut our total saturated fat intake. What the researchers fail to mention is that our risk would drop even lower if we dropped the beef, as was pointed out by the chair of nutrition at Harvard in a response to the study. The subjects in this study went from a high risk of dying from heart disease to… a high risk of dying from heart disease. We need to get our LDL (bad) cholesterol down to 50, 60, or 70 to become essentially heart attack proof (see Eliminating the #1 Cause of Death). For most people, that means eliminating saturated animal fat and cholesterol intake completely. This study is really just showing how bad saturated fat is from any animal source. Yes, based on saturated fat levels, lean beef is often better than chicken (and Twinkies), but that’s like touting the health benefits of Coca Cola because it has less sugar than Pepsi. It does—15 spoonfuls of sugar per bottle instead of 16—but that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t be better not consuming soda at all. Reminds me of this study: “Cheese Intake Lowers LDL-Cholesterol Compared With Butter Intake….” [emphasis added] In my video, Bold Indeed: Beef Lowers Cholesterol? you can see the beef industry’s release. and how they ended up with the “cholesterol-lowering effects of beef.” If we cut out enough poultry, pork, fish, and cheese from our diet, we could replace this with almost anything (bacon grease, candy, frosting, deep-fried snickers bars, sewer sludge, etc.), and still reduce cholesterol levels. How are Americans exposed to saturated fat? Burgers actually fall well below chicken. See Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. The beef industry is by no means alone in having a corrupting influence on the scientific method.

A-258	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/12/how-grapefruit-affects-prescription-drugs/	How Grapefruit Affects Prescription Drugs	Does grapefruit in particular help people lose weight? If someone eats half of a grapefruit three times a day before each meal for a couple months, they may lose about two pounds — but that’s no more than if they ate three apples or pears a day. In one study, the grapefruit eaters not only saw their weight go down, but their waist got slimmer, and their body fat melted away. If, however, we repeat the experiment and instead ask people to drink a half cup of water before each meal, we get the same result. So this belief that grapefruit has some special fat-burning quality appears to be just a long-held myth. The researchers reported that grapefruit consumers had a drop in weight, a significant drop in cholesterol, and a significant drop in blood pressure. They concluded that consumption of grapefruit daily for six weeks does not significantly decrease body weight, cholesterol, or blood pressure, though. That made me do a little double take, but again, it’s because the grapefruit didn’t do any better than placebo. Other studies have found a legitimate cholesterol-lowering benefit of grapefruit, and even a little dip in triglycerides, especially eating red as opposed to white . For example, one study showed a decrease in cholesterol, but only from one life-threatening cholesterol level to another life-threatening cholesterol level. To prevent heart disease, we really have to get down to a total cholesterol of around 150, which is the average cholesterol of those eating diets composed exclusively of plant foods, not just grapefruits (See, for example, One in a Thousand: Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic). Even though grapefruits alone don’t do much, the researchers suggest that people might be more likely to stick with them than cholesterol lowering drugs, noting that most people with heart disease stop taking their statin drugs within a couple years because of the adverse side effects (see Statin Muscle Toxicity). While grapefruits alone don’t have any side effects, ironically, combining grapefruits and drugs can make drug side effects even worse. If we eat lots of fruits and vegetables, we hopefully won’t need a lot of drugs (Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants), but certain phytochemicals in plants can affect the metabolism of drugs in the body. Grapefruit is the poster child, described as a “pharmacologist’s nightmare.” Natural phytochemicals in grapefruit suppress the enzymes that help clear more than half of commonly prescribed drugs, and less drug clearance means higher drug levels in the body. This may actually be good if we want a better caffeine buzz from our morning coffee, or our doctors want to help us save thousands of dollars by boosting the effects of expensive drugs instead of just peeing them away. But higher drug levels may mean higher risk of side effects. Women taking the Pill are normally at a higher risk of blood clots, but even more so, perhaps, if they have been consuming grapefruit. Taking the Pill with grapefruit juice may increase blood drug concentrations by 137 percent. If suppressing our drug clearance enzymes with grapefruit juice elevates levels of ingested estrogen, what might it be doing to our own estrogen levels? A study associating grapefruit consumption with breast cancer freaked out the medical community, but subsequent studies on even larger groups of women found no evidence of a link. The Harvard Nurses’ Study even found a decreased risk of the scariest breast cancer type, so it doesn’t look like we have to worry about grapefruit affecting our natural chemistry. For those prescribed unnatural chemistries, it may be a good idea to discontinue grapefruit consumption for 72 hours before use of a drug that may interact with it. If you don’t want to give up your grapefruit, you can ask your doctor about switching from a grapefruit-affected drug like Lipitor to one of the citrus-proof alternatives (the replacement drug chart can be seen in my video, Tell Your Doctor If You Eat Grapefruit).

A-259	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/08/07/dr-greger-addresses-gluten-in-new-dvd/	Dr. Greger Addresses Gluten in New DVD	Until recently, those complaining to their doctors about symptoms associated with the wheat protein gluten were commonly referred to psychiatrists. The medical profession has a tragic history of dismissing genuine diseases as all in peoples’ heads. PTSD, ulcerative colitis, migraines, ulcers, asthma, Parkinson’s and MS were all conditions that were originally rejected by the prevailing medical community as mere psychosomatic hysteria. On the flip side, the internet is rife with unsubstantiated claims like “17 million Americans are gluten sensitive,” which has spilled over into the popular press to make gluten the diet villain du jour. This has led to a multi-billion dollar gluten-free food industry. Any time there’s that much money at stake, it’s hard to trust anyone, so as always, best to stick to the science. This is easier said than done, though–more than 10,000 papers have been published on gluten in the medical literature. But that’s what you have me for! Allow me to spare your summertime beach reading list and do all the work for you. Is gluten sensitivity real? If so, how many does it affect? Should one just err on the side of caution and avoid gluten or are there actual benefits of gluten on which the gluten-free crowd is missing out? I answer these and lots more questions in three new videos on gluten in my new DVD, Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 20. The gluten videos will all be up in a few weeks on NutritionFacts.org, but you can watch them right now via video download or order them on DVD on my website or through Amazon (all proceeds go to this charity). The current batch of videos from volume 19 on NutritionFacts.org just ran out, so starting this month and running through October, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 20. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–40+ hours of video–I have a new 1-20 set for the complete DVD collection.

A-260	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/31/does-animal-protein-cause-osteoporosis/	Does Animal Protein Cause Osteoporosis?	For most of the last century, a prevailing theory within the field of nutrition was that by eating acid-forming foods such as meat, we were, in essence, at risk of peeing our bones down the toilet. And no wonder! Experiments dating back to 1920 showed over and over that if we add meat to our diet we get a big spike in the amount of calcium being lost in the urine. And this made total sense. We had known since 1912 that meat was acid-forming within the body, and how do we buffer acid? What are in antacid (anti-acid) pills like Tums? Calcium compounds. Meat and eggs have a lot of sulphur-containing amino acids (two to five times more than grains and beans) that are metabolized into sulphuric acid, which the body buffers with calcium compounds. And where is calcium stored in the body? The skeleton. So the thinking was that every time we ate a steak, our body would pull calcium from our bones, bit by bit, and over time this could lead to osteoporosis. Based on 26 such studies, for every 40 grams of protein we add to our daily diet, we pee out an extra 50 mg of calcium. We only have about two pounds of calcium in our skeleton, so the loss of 50 milligrams a day would mean losing close to 2% of our bone calcium every year. By the end of the 20th century, there was little doubt that acid-forming diets would dissolve our bones away. But if we actually look at the studies done on protein intake and bone health, that’s not what we find. So, where’s the flaw in the logic? Meat leads to acid, which leads to calcium loss, which leads to bone loss, right? Well, it’s uncontroversial that protein results in greater calcium excretion, but we’ve just been assuming it’s coming from the bone—where else could the extra calcium dumped in our urine be coming from but our bones? One study appeared to solve the mystery. An intrepid group of researchers tried feeding a group of volunteers radioactive calcium and then put them on a high protein diet. What happens when we put people on a high protein diet? The amount of calcium in their urine shoots up, and indeed that’s just what happened. But here’s the big question, was that extra calcium in their urine radioactive or not? To everyone’s surprise, it was radioactive. This meant that the excess calcium in their urine was coming from their diet, not from their bones. What seemed to be happening is that the excess protein consumption boosted calcium absorption, from down around 19% up to 26%. All of a sudden there was all this extra calcium in the blood, so presumably the kidneys are like “whoa, what are we going to do with it all?” So they dump it into the urine. 90% of the extra calcium in the urine after eating a steak doesn’t appear to be coming from our bones but from our diet. We’re not sure why protein boosts calcium absorption. Maybe protein increases the solubility of calcium by stimulating stomach acid production? Whatever the reason, there was indeed more calcium lost, but also more calcium gained such that in the end, most of that extra calcium is accounted for. In effect, more calcium is lost in the urine stream, but it may be compensated by less loss of calcium through the fecal stream. This was repeated with even more extreme diets—an acid-forming five-burgers-a-day-worth-of-animal protein diet that limited fruits and vegetables versus an alkaline diet emphasizing fruits and vegetables. More calcium in the urine on burgers, but significantly greater calcium absorption, such that at the end it was pretty much a wash. Other studies have also since supported this interpretation. Here’s an ingenious one: Feed people a high animal protein diet but add in an alkali salt to neutralize the acid. The old thinking would predict that there would be no calcium loss since there is no excess acid to buffer, but no, even though the acid load was neutralized, there was still the excess urinary calcium, consistent with the radioactive isotope study, challenging the “long-standing dogma that animal protein consumption results in a mild acidosis promoting the increased excretion of calcium.” So if our body isn’t buffering the acid formed from our diet with our bones, how is it neutralizing the acid? Maybe with our muscles. Alkaline diets may protect our muscle mass! I cover that in my video Testing Your Diet with Pee and Purple Cabbage. Now the boost in calcium absorption can only compensate if we’re taking enough in. For example, dietary acid load may be associated with lower bone mineral density in those getting under 800mg a day. Plant Protein is Preferable to animal protein for a variety of reasons (tends to have less methionine, is less IGF-1 promoting, etc.), but it’s not clear how much of an advantage it has when it comes to bone health. I previously touched on this topic in my video Is Protein Bad to the Bone? But I promised I’d take a deeper dive, hence my video Alkaline Diets, Meat & Calcium Loss. -Michael Greger, M.D. 	-	acid/base balance,alkaline diet,animal products,animal protein,antacids,beans,beef,bone fractures,bone health,bone mineral density,burgers,calcium,chicken,eggs,fish,fruit,grains,hamburgers,kidney disease,kidney function,kidney health,meat,medications,osteoporosis,pork,poultry,protein,steak,stomach health,Tums,turkey,vegetables	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-protein-bad-to-the-bone/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21976719,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15546911,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18721741,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22127335,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23873776,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19864406,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/index.php?s=protein,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21248199,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19889822,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-protein-bad-to-the-bone/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21481501	
A-261	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/29/quadrupling-breast-cancer-survival/	Quadrupling Breast Cancer Survival	Half a million Americans are expected to die this year from cancer, equal to five jumbo jets crashing every day. The number of Americans who die from cancer each year is more than all those who have died in all U.S. wars combined. And this happens every single year. After a cancer diagnosis people tend to clean up their diets. About a third to a half of breast cancer patients, for example, make healthy dietary changes following diagnosis, such as increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and decreasing meat, fat, and sugar intakes. Does it actually help that late in the game? Well, the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study was undertaken in a few thousand breast cancer survivors to determine if a plant-based, low-fat, high-fiber diet could influence breast cancer recurrence rates and survival. Previously they famously reported that simple changes — five or more servings of fruits and veggies a day and just walking 30 minutes a day six days a week — were associated with a significant survival advantage, cutting the risk of death nearly in half. Note: it was fruits and veggies and exercise. In the video, Breast Cancer Survival Vegetable, you can see the proportion of women with breast cancer surviving nine years in the study if they had low fruit and vegetable consumption and low physical activity, compared to those high in one and low in the other, compared to the survival curve of those high in both. And it worked just as well in women with estrogen receptor negative tumors, which normally have twice the mortality — unless women eat those few fruits and veggies and take a few strolls. Imagine, for a second, you or a loved one has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Imagine sitting in that chair, in the doctor’s office, as your doctor gives you the news. But, she says, there’s a new experimental treatment that can cut your chances of dying in the next few years from 16 percent down to just 4 percent. To quadruple their survival rate, many women would re-mortgage their homes to fly to some quack clinic in Mexico and would lose all their hair to chemo, but most, apparently, couldn’t stand the thought of eating broccoli. The Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study found that while fruits and vegetables in general may be good, cruciferous vegetables may be better. For women on tamoxifen, for example, women who consumed one of their five daily servings of fruits and veggies as broccoli, cauliflower, collards, cabbage, or kale had their risk of cancer recurrence cut in half. I recommend that all women with breast cancer eat broccoli sprouts. See my 8-part video series: 1. DNA Protection from Broccoli 2.

A-262	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/24/cancer-and-the-animal-to-plant-protein-ratio/	Cancer & the Animal-to-Plant Protein Ratio	It is now eight years since the famous Ornish study was published, suggesting that 12 months on a strictly plant-based diet could reverse the progression of prostate cancer. For those unfamiliar with that landmark Ornish study, see Cancer Reversal through Diet?, which the Pritikin Foundation followed up on with Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay. Wait a second. How were they able to get a group of older men to go vegan for a year? They home delivered prepared meals to their doors, I guess figuring men are so lazy they’ll just eat whatever is put in front of them. But what about out in the real world? Realizing that we can’t even get most men with cancer to eat a measly five servings of fruits and veggies, in a study profiled in my video, Prostate Cancer Survival: The A/V Ratio, researchers settled on just trying to change their A to V ratio—the ratio of animal to vegetable proteins—and indeed were successful in cutting this ratio by at least half, from about two to one animal to plant, to kind of half vegan, one to one. How’d the men do? Their cancer appeared to slow down. The average PSA doubling time (an estimate of how fast the tumor may be doubling in size) in the “half vegan” group slowed from 21 months to 58 months. So the cancer kept growing, but with a part-time plant-based diet they were able to slow down the tumor’s expansion. What Ornish got, though, was an apparent reversal in cancer growth—the PSA didn’t just rise slower, it trended down, which could be an indication of tumor shrinkage. So the ideal A to V ratio may be closer to zero. If there’s just no way grandpa’s going vegan, and we just have half-measures, which might be the worst A and the best V? Eggs and poultry may be the worst, respectively doubling and potentially quadrupling the risk of cancer progression in a study out of Harvard. Twice the risk eating less than a single egg a day and up to quadruple the risk eating less than a single daily serving of chicken or turkey. And if we could only add one thing to our diet, what would it be? Cruciferous vegetables. Less than a single serving a day of either broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, or kale may cut the risk of cancer progression (defined as the cancer coming back, spreading to the bone, or death) by more than half. The animal to plant ratio might be useful for cancer prevention as well. For example, in the largest study ever performed on diet and bladder cancer, just a 3% increase in the consumption of animal protein was associated with a 15% higher risk of bladder cancer, whereas a 2% increase in plant protein intake was associated with a 23% lower risk. Even little changes in our diets can have significant effects. What else might help men with prostate cancer? See Flax Seeds vs. Prostate Cancer and Saturated Fat & Cancer Progression. What about preventing it in the first place? See: Poultry and eggs may be related to cancer risk in a variety of ways: Crucifers may also help with other cancers.

A-263	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/22/how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-diet/	How to Treat Multiple Sclerosis with Diet	Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and frightening degenerative autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in which our body attacks our own nerves. It often strikes in the prime of life and can cause symptoms in the brain, such as cognitive impairment; in the eye, such as painful loss of vision; as well as tremors, weakness, loss of bladder control, pain, and fatigue. The most frequently prescribed drug for multiple sclerosis is interferon beta, which can make one feel lousy and cost $30,000 a year. But hey, it might be worthwhile—if it actually worked. We learned recently that it doesn’t seem to prevent or delay long-term disability. That leaves chemo drugs like mitoxantrone that causes irreversible heart damage in one out of every eight people who go on the drug and causes cancer (leukemia) in nearly 1% of people who take it. But MS is no walk in the park either. If only there was a cheap, simple, safe, side-effect free solution that also just so happened to be the most effective treatment for MS ever prescribed… Dr. Roy Swank, who we lost recently at age 99, was a distinguished neurologist whose research culminated in over 170 scientific papers. In the video, Treating Multiple Sclerosis with the Swank MS Diet, I highlight a few. As far back as 1950, we knew there were areas in the world that had a lot of MS—North America, Europe—and other places—Africa and Asia—that hardly had any. And migration studies show that those who move from a high risk area to a low risk area significantly drop their risk, and vice versa. So it seems less genetic and more lifestyle. Dr. Swank had an idea. As he recounts in an interview with Dr. John McDougall at the ripe young age of 84, “it seemed possible to me that this could be a matter of food, because the further north you go the less vegetarian a life is led and the more people are carnivores, you might say—they spend a lot more time eating meat.” After looking at the multiple sclerosis data from World War II in occupied countries where meat and dairy were rationed, along with his famous study in ’52 that found that the frequency of MS related directly to the amount of saturated animal fat consumed daily in different areas of Norway, he concluded that it might be the animal fat that was causing the increased risk. He decided to put it to the test by restricting people’s intake of saturated animal fat, most commonly coming from dairy and chicken in the U.S. (See Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero). In Treating Multiple Sclerosis with the Swank MS Diet, you can see data on his first 47 patients before cutting out about 90% of the saturated fat from their diet and after, showing a decrease in both the frequency and severity of MS attacks. Normally, we’re lucky if we can get people to stick to a diet for six months, and so that’s why most dietary trials last a year at the most. The first study he published reported results from the first three and a half years. Then came the five and a half year follow-up in which he added about another 100 patients. Then the seven year follow-up, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Then the 20 year follow-up, and then the 34 year follow-up. How did his patients do? If we can get to people early in their disease, when they’re only mildly disabled, and restrict their saturated fat intake, Dr. Swank showed he could stop their disease in 95% of cases—no further disability 34 years later. But if they started slacking on their diet—even years in, their disease could become reactivated. They felt so great that some felt that they could cheat a little bit, since they had their disease so well under control. But eating just eight grams of saturated fat more a day was accompanied by a striking increase in disability and a near tripling of their death rate. How about a 50 year follow-up! They were able to track down 15 of the original patients that stuck to the diet, now in their 70s and 80s, with multiple sclerosis for over 50 years, and 13 out of 15 were walking around normal in all respects. Conclusion: “This study indicated that, in all probability, MS is caused largely by consumption of saturated animal fat.” Dr. Swank thought it was the sludging of the blood caused by even a single meal of saturated fats that can clog tiny capillaries that feed our nervous system. Diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol can thicken the blood and make our red cells sticky. A single meal of sausage and eggs can stick our blood cells together like rolls of quarters. And that kind of hyperaggregation can lead to a reduction of blood flow and oxygenation of our tissues. What’s in sausage and eggs that may cause so much inflammation? See my video series on endotoxins described in my blog How Does Meat Cause Inflammation? If we put someone’s blood through a machine that sucks out about 90% of the cholesterol in their blood, we can demonstrate an immediate improvement in microcirculation in the heart muscle. But what about the brain? The eyes are the windows… to our brain. We can visualize—in real-time—changes in blood vessel function in the retina at the back of the eye, which gives us a sense of what’s happening further back in the brain. And if we lower the cholesterol level in the blood, we can immediately get a significant improvement in vasodilation—the little veins open wider and let the blood flow. So yes, it could be the animal fat leading to clogging of our capillaries, but now we know animal fats can have all sorts of other deleterious effects such as inflammation, so who knows what the actual mechanism may be by which cutting animal fat can cut MS progression. Regardless, patients with MS that follow a diet with no more than 10 or 15 grams of saturated fat can expect to survive and thrive to a ripe old age. Of course, cutting out saturated fat completely might be better, given that heart disease is our number one killer. The bottom line is that the results Dr. Swank published remain “the most effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ever reported in the peer reviewed medical literature.” In patients with early stage MS, 95% were without progression of their disease 34 years later after adopting his low saturated fat dietary program. Even patients with initially advanced disease showed significant benefit. To date, no medication or invasive procedure has ever even come close, to demonstrating such success. Doesn’t cost $30,000 dollars; doesn’t give you leukemia—and works. Better! This all begs one big obvious question: If Dr. Swanks results are “so stunningly impressive, why haven’t other physicians, neurologists, and centers adopted this method of treatment?” One reason may be that MRI machines weren’t invented until the 1970s, decades after Dr. Swank’s study began. MRIs are how we track the progress of MS today. We don’t have to rely on patients’ subjective reports or doctor’s clinical judgments, we can see the disease get better or worse right there in black and white. It’s like in the 1970s when Nathan Pritikin appeared to reverse heart disease by the thousands but no one took him seriously until angiography was invented and the likes of Ornish and Esselstyn (see Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped) could hold up angiographic images, proving conclusively that a plant-based diet could help literally open up arteries. So what we need is someone to repeat Swank’s experiment today with MRI scans every step of the way. And I’m happy to report that exact experiment was just completed by Dr. John McDougall. Dr. Swank was one of Dr. McDougall’s heroes, and Dr. McDougall is one of mine. Study enrollment was completed last year and we should have the full results soon. I touched on this in my live 2013 year-in-review lecture More Than an Apple a Day, but I’m excited to be able to take a deeper dive into this extraordinary story. Those interested in supporting Dr. McDougall’s landmark study (headed by Dr. Dennis Bourdette, M.D. and under the supervision of Dr. Vijayshree Yadav) can donate to his nonprofit McDougall Research & Education Foundation (you can also donate to NutritionFacts.org to help keep us bringing you similarly underreported yet life-saving science). 	-	acute myeloid leukemia,Africa,aging,angiogram,animal fat,animal products,Asia,autoimmune diseases,beef,bladder disease,bladder health,brain disease,brain health,cardiovascular health,chemotherapy,chicken,cholesterol,cognition,dairy,Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn,Dr. Dean Ornish,Dr. John McDougall,Dr. Roy Swank,eggs,Europe,eye disease,eye health,fat,fatigue,heart disease,heart health,inflammation,LDL cholesterol,leukemia,low-fat diets,meat,medications,milk,mortality,multiple sclerosis,nerve health,Norway,pain,plant-based diets,pork,poultry,Pritikin,saturated fat,sausage,side effects,surgery,tremors,turkey,vegans,vegetarians,vision weakness	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/why-meat-causes-inflammation/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22666902,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001747/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/why-meat-causes-inflammation/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15095396,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22797642,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20439849,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-multiple-sclerosis-with-the-swank-ms-diet/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12451193,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12591551,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14771073,http://www.drmcdougall.com/about/foundation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12996138,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12591552,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.swankmsdiet.org/Dr%20Swank%20Obituary,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5471652,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14929306,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1973220	
A-264	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/15/stopping-heart-disease-in-childhood/	Stopping Heart Disease in Childhood	A landmark paper in 1953 radically changed our view about the development of heart disease forever. The study looked at a series of 300 autopsies performed on U.S. battle casualties of the Korean War. The average age was 22 years old, but 77% of the soldiers’ hearts had gross evidence—meaning visible-to-the-eye evidence—of coronary atherosclerosis, hardening of their arteries. Some of them had vessels that were clogged off 90% or more. As an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded, “This widely cited publication dramatically showed that atherosclerotic changes appear in the coronary arteries years and decades before the age at which coronary heart disease (CHD) becomes a clinically recognized problem.” Follow-up studies on the hearts of thousands of more soldiers over the subsequent years confirmed their results. How young does it go? Fatty streaks, the first stage of atherosclerosis, were found in the arteries of 100% of kids by age ten. What’s accounting for this buildup of plaque even in childhood? In the ‘80s we got our first clue in the famous Bogalusa Heart Study. This looked at autopsies of those who died between the ages of 3 to 26 years old, and the #1 risk factor was cholesterol intake. There was a dramatic stepwise increase in the proportion of their arteries covered in fatty streaks as the level of bad cholesterol in the blood increased. As powerful as this was, the study only looked at 30 kids. So they decided to study 3000: three thousand accidental death victims, ages 15 through 34. After thousands of autopsies, they were able to produce a scoring system that could predict the presence of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries of young people. The higher our score, the higher the likelihood we have these lesions growing in the arteries that pump blood and oxygen to our heart. So if we’re young and we smoke, our risk goes up by one point. If we have high blood pressure at such a young age, that’s four points. If we’re an obese male, that’s six points, but high cholesterol was the worst of all. If our non-HDL cholesterol (meaning the total cholesterol minus the good cholesterol) is above 220 or so, our risk increased eight times more than if we smoked. Let’s say you’re a woman with relatively high cholesterol, but you don’t smoke, you’re not overweight, your blood pressure and blood sugars are OK. At your sweet 16 there’s just about a 1 in 30 (3%) chance you already have an advanced atherosclerotic lesion in your heart, but if you don’t improve your diet, by your 30th birthday, it’s closer to a one in five (20%) chance you have some serious heart disease, and if you have really high cholesterol it could be closer to one in three (33%). In the video, Heart Disease Starts in Childhood, you can see what happens to our risk if we bring our cholesterol down to even just that of a lacto-ovo vegetarian, or if we exercise to boost our HDL, etc. It shows that even in 15 to 19-year-olds, atherosclerosis has begun in a substantial number of individuals, and this observation suggests beginning primary prevention at least by the late teenage years to ameliorate every stage of atherosclerosis and to prevent or retard progression to more advanced lesions. If we start kids out on a low saturated fat diet, we may see a significant improvement in their arterial function by 11 years old. The study concluded, “Exposure to high serum cholesterol concentration even in childhood may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis. Consequently the long-term prevention of atherosclerosis might be most effective when initiated early in life.” And by early in life they meant infancy. Atherosclerosis, hardening of the arteries, begins in childhood. By age ten nearly all kids have fatty streaks, the first stage of the disease. Then the plaques start forming in our 20s, get worse in our 30s, and can start killing us off in middle age. In our hearts it’s a heart attack, in our brains it’s a stroke, in our extremities it can mean gangrene, and in our aorta, an aneurism. For those of us older than ten years of age, the choice likely isn’t whether or not to eat healthy to prevent heart disease, it’s whether or not we want to reverse the heart disease we likely already have. Drs. Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. proved that we can reverse heart disease with a plant-based diet, but we don’t have to wait until our first heart attack to start unclogging our arteries. We can start reversing our heart disease right now. We can start reversing heart disease in our kids tonight. The bottom line is that we have tremendous control over our medical destinies. How do we go about reversing our heart disease? I address that question in my latest live annual review presentation More Than an Apple a Day.

A-265	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/10/how-plant-based-diets-may-extend-our-lives/	How Plant-Based Diets May Extend Our Lives	A recent review suggested that plant-based diets may prove to be a useful nutritional strategy for lifespan extension in part because they tend to be naturally low in the amino acid methionine (see my video Starving Cancer with Methionine Restriction). Apparently, the less methionine there is in body tissues, the longer different animals tend to live. But what are the possible implications for humans? See my video Methionine Restriction as a Life Extension Strategy. I’ve talked before about the free radical theory of aging, the concept that aging can be thought of as the oxidation of our bodies just like rust is the oxidation of metal (see Mitochondrial Theory of Aging). Methionine is thought to have a pro-oxidant effect. The thinking is that lowering methionine intake leads to less free radical production, thereby slowing aging. Fewer free radicals would decrease the rate of DNA damage, which would curtail the rate of DNA mutation, slowing the rate of aging and disease and potentially increasing our lifespan. There are three ways to lower methionine intake: The first is caloric restriction. By decreasing our overall intake of food, we would reduce our intake of methionine. Or, because methionine is found protein, we could practice protein restriction, eating a relatively protein deficient diet. The third option is eat enough food, eat enough protein, but just stick to proteins that are relatively low in methionine, which tends to mean plant proteins. Caloric restriction is hard, because we walk around starving all the time. Something like every-other-day eating is described as “never likely to gain much popularity as a pro-longevity strategy for humans, so it may be more feasible to achieve moderate methionine restriction by eating a plant-based diet.” On a population-wide level, folks could benefit from just lowering their protein intake, period. Researchers noted that “the mean intake of proteins [and thus methionine] of Western human populations is much higher than needed. Therefore, decreasing such levels has a great potential to lower tissue oxidative stress and to increase healthy life span in humans while avoiding the possible undesirable effects of caloric restriction.” We’re eating around double the protein we need, so the first thing doctors can recommend is to decrease the intake of protein, but we can also get our methionine even lower by eating a plant-based diet. The fact that beans have comparably low methionine has been classically considered a disadvantage. But, given the capacity of methionine restriction to decrease the rate of free radical generation in internal organs, to lower markers of chronic disease, and to increase maximum longevity, this “disadvantage” may actually be a strong advantage. This fits well with the important role of beans in healthy diets like the traditional Mediterranean diet. Interestingly, soy protein is also especially poor in methionine, which may help explain the healthy effects iof soyfoods. Watch my video Increased Lifespan from Beans. The reason why plant-based diets are so protective is not known. Yes, vegetables contain thousands of phytochemicals, but separately investigating their possible protective roles would be an impossible task. The idea that the protective effect is not due to any of the individual plant food components, but to a synergic “combined effect” is gaining acceptance. However, based on the relationship of excess dietary methionine to vital organ toxicity, as well as its likely mechanism of action through increases in free radical generation, the possibility exists that the protective effects of plant-based diets can be due, at least in part, to their lower methionine content. As one paper concluded, “The low-methionine content of vegan diets may make methionine restriction feasible as a life extension strategy.” Plant-based diets can also mimic other benefits of caloric restriction, such as improving levels of the “fountain of youth” hormone DHEA. See The Benefits of Caloric Restriction Without the Actual Restricting. Americans are living longer but sicker lives. That’s why we need a diet and lifestyle that supports health and longevity.

A-266	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/08/a-low-methionine-diet-may-help-starve-cancer-cells/	A Low-Methionine Diet May Help Starve Cancer Cells	When designing an antibiotic, we can’t create a drug that destroys DNA because that’s something that both humans and bacteria share in common. It would kill bacteria, but it might kill us, too. Instead, many antibiotics work by attacking bacterial cell walls, which is something bacteria have that we don’t. Similarly, antifungals can attack the unique cell walls of fungus. Pesticides can work by attacking the special exoskeleton of insects. But fighting cancer is harder because cancer cells are our own cells. So fighting cancer comes down to trying to find and exploit differences between cancer cells and normal cells. Forty years ago, a landmark paper was published showing for the first time that many human cancers have what’s called “absolute methionine dependency,” meaning that if we try to grow cells in a Petri dish without giving them the amino acid methionine, normal cells thrive, but without methionine, cancer cells die. Normal breast cells grow no matter what, with or without methionine, but cancer cells need that added methionine to grow. What does cancer do with the methionine? Tumors use it to generate gaseous sulfur-containing compounds that, interestingly, can be detected by specially trained diagnostic dogs. There are mole-sniffing dogs that can pick out skin cancer. There are breath-sniffing dogs that can pick out people with lung cancer. Pee-sniffing dogs that can diagnose bladder cancer and–you guessed it–fart-sniffing dogs for colorectal cancer. Doctors can now bring their lab to the lab! It gives a whole new meaning to the term “pet scan.” :) Methionine dependency is not just present in cancer cell lines in a Petri dish. Fresh tumors taken from patients show that many cancers appear to have a biochemical defect that makes them dependent on methionine, including some tumors of the colon, breast, ovary, prostate, and skin. Pharmaceutical companies are fighting to be the first to come out with a drug that decreases methionine levels. But since methionine is sourced mainly from food, a better strategy may be to lower methionine levels by lowering methionine intake, eliminating high methionine foods to control cancer growth as well as improve our lifespan (see Methionine Restriction as a Life-Extension Strategy). Here’s the thinking: smoking cessation, consumption of diets rich in plants, and other lifestyle measures can prevent the majority of cancers. Unfortunately, people don’t do them, and as a result hundreds of thousands of Americans develop metastatic cancer each year. Chemotherapy cures only a few types of metastatic cancer. Unfortunately, the vast majority of common metastatic cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon, and lung, are lethal. We therefore desperately need novel treatment strategies for metastatic cancer, and dietary methionine restriction may be one such strategy. So, where is methionine found? In my video, Starving Cancer with Methionine Restriction, you can see a graph of foods with their respective methionine levels. Chicken and fish have the highest levels. Milk, red meat, and eggs have less, but if we really want to stick with lower methionine foods, fruits, nuts, veggies, grains, and beans are the best. In other words, “In humans, methionine restriction may be achieved using a predominately vegan diet.” There are also compounds in animal products that may actually stimulate tumor growth. See, for example, How Tumors Use Meat to Grow: Xeno-Autoantibodies. Animal protein may also boost levels of the cancer-promoting hormone IGF-1 (The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle). Combined, this could all help explain why plants and plant-based diets have been found effective in potentially reversing some cancer processes. See Cancer Reversal Through Diet?, Strawberries versus Esophageal Cancer, and Black Raspberries versus Oral Cancer. So why isn’t every oncologist prescribing a low-methionine diet? One researcher notes that “Despite many promising preclinical and clinical studies in recent years, dietary methionine restriction and other dietary approaches to cancer treatment have not yet gained wide clinical application. Most clinicians and investigators are probably unfamiliar with nutritional approaches to cancer.” That’s an understatement! “Many others may consider amino acid restriction as an ‘old idea,’ since it has been examined for several decades. However, many good ideas remain latent for decades if not centuries before they prove valuable in the clinic….With the proper development, dietary methionine restriction, either alone or in combination with other treatments, may prove to have a major impact on patients with cancer.” Why might the medical profession be so resistant to therapies proven to be effective? The Tomato Effect may be partially to blame. In my video, Anti-Angiogenesis: Cutting Off Tumor Supply Lines, researchers come to the same plant-based conclusion from a different perspective, starving cancers of their blood supply. 	-	animal products,beans,beef,bladder cancer,bladder disease,bladder health,breast cancer,breast cancer survival,breast disease,breast health,cancer,cancer survival,chemotherapy,chicken,colon cancer,colon health,dairy,dogs,eggs,fish,fruit,fungicides,grains,insects,leukemia,lung cancer,lung disease,lung health,meat,medications,metastases,methionine,milk,nuts,ovarian cancer,ovary health,pesticides,plant-based diets,poultry,prostate cancer,prostate health,rectal cancer,red meat,skin cancer,skin health,smoking,tobacco,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,women's health	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow-xeno-autoantibodies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/strawberries-versus-esophageal-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-angiogenesis-cutting-off-tumor-supply-lines/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension-strategy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow-xeno-autoantibodies/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22342103,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/strawberries-versus-esophageal-cancer/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8495409,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11603655,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-angiogenesis-cutting-off-tumor-supply-lines/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22345057,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension-strategy/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21282130,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/applan/article/S0168-1591%2804%2900111-X/abstract,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15388612,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-raspberries-versus-oral-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4524624,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21836027,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction/	
A-267	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/03/how-animal-proteins-may-trigger-autoimmune-disease/	How Animal Proteins May Trigger Autoimmune Disease	Although slaughterhouse workers with the most poultry exposure appear to suffer the greatest excess mortality (see Poultry Exposure Tied to Liver and Pancreatic Cancer), increased risk of death from cancer is also found in other slaughterplant workers. This research goes back decades and shows higher cancer rates in butchers, slaughterhouse workers, meat cutters, and those working in meat processing plants. The increased risk for meat industry workers in developing and dying from cancer “may be due to animal-to-human viruses or antigenic stimulation through chronic exposure to animal protein.” Cancer-causing virus exposure could also help explain why those who eat meat have higher cancer rates. There’s even a retrovirus associated with cancerous fish tumors, which has been speculated as the cause for increased cancer rates in American seafood workers. Growing up on a livestock farm is associated with higher rates of blood-borne cancer, lymphomas and leukemia. Worst, though, is growing up on a poultry farm, which is consistent with chicken consumption being most closely tied to these cancers. Eating a quarter of a chicken breast daily is associated with a doubling or tripling of risk for these cancers (see EPIC Findings on Lymphoma). Growing up on a farm raising only plant crops, however, is not associated with blood-borne cancers. What about growing up with dogs and cats? See Pets & Human Lymphoma and Are Cats or Dogs More Protective for Children’s Health? You still probably shouldn’t eat them, though (see Foodborne Rabies). Researchers are finally able to start connecting the dots. High levels of antibodies to avian leucosis/sarcoma viruses and reticuloendotheliosis viruses in poultry workers provide evidence of infectious exposure to these cancer-causing poultry viruses. The highest levels were found not in the eviscerators, or gut-pullers, or those that hang the live birds, but among the line workers that just cut up the final product. In an attempt to narrow down which diseases were associated with which meat, researchers tried separating out those in pig slaughtering and pork processing. “One of the primary sources of concern in using pig organs and tissues as transplants in humans is the fear of introducing zoonotic infections” from animals. We’re concerned about what’s called PERV transmission, the pig-to-human transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses, raising theoretical concerns about cancer, immunological, and neurological disorders. However, we don’t need to get a pig transplant to be exposed. PERVs are also found in blood, so people exposed to pig blood may be exposed to the virus. The main finding unique to the pork study (profiled in my video Eating Outside Our Kingdom), which was not found in beef and sheep processing, was the significant excess of deaths “from senile conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.” It reminds me of all those poor pork brain extraction workers. You think your job is bad? How would you like to work at the “head-table”? Well, that doesn’t sound so bad until you learn it’s where, through the “unbridled use of compressed air in the pursuit of maximum yield of soft tissue,” they remove the brains of severed swine heads. In one study, researchers noted that as the line speeds increased, “the workers reported being unable to place the skulls completely on the brain removal device before triggering the compressed air, causing greater splatter of brain material.” The aerosolized “mist of brain” is suspected to be the cause of dozens of cases of inflammatory neurological disease in workers who started with symptoms as mild as pain, tingling, and difficulty walking, and ended up so bad that doctors had to put them in a coma for six weeks because of unrelenting seizures. At first researchers thought it was a brain parasite, but now it’s known to be an auto-immune attack triggered by the exposure to aerosolized brain. A similar mechanism has been blamed for meat proteins triggering inflammatory arthritis in people eating meat. By eating fellow animals, we are exposed not only to fellow animal diseases, but to animal tissues that our body may mistake as our own. This may be one advantage to eating a more plant-based diet. By eating outside of the animal kingdom—dipping into the plant or mushroom kingdoms for supper—not only do we not have to worry about getting something like Dutch elm disease, but we can be reassured by the fact that never has an “auto-immune polyradiculoneuropathy” been blamed on a head… of lettuce. For more on foodborne illnesses one can contract from fellow animals, see, for example: Probably the strangest example of this whole concept is the Neu5Gc story.

A-268	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/07/01/handling-poultry-tied-to-liverpancreatic-cancers/	Handling Poultry Tied to Liver/Pancreatic Cancers	Thousands of Americans continue to die from asbestos exposure decades after many uses were banned since the cancers can take years to show up. We are now in the so-called “third wave” of asbestos-related disease. The first wave was in the asbestos miners, which started in the 1920s. The second phase was in the workers—the ship-builders and construction workers that used the stuff in the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s. Now, as buildings “constructed with asbestos over the past six decades begin to age and deteriorate,” not only are workers at risk, but “potential also exists for serious environmental exposure to asbestos among residents, tenants and users of these buildings, such as school children, office workers, maintenance workers, and the general public.” “The Centers for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have projected that over the next 30 years approximately 1,000 cases of mesothelioma and lung cancer will occur among persons in the United States exposed to asbestos in school buildings as school children.” To see if something is carcinogenic, we study those who have the most exposure. That’s how we learned about the potential cancer-causing dangers of asbestos, and that’s how we’re learning about the potential cancer-causing dangers of poultry viruses. For years I’ve talked about the excess mortality in poultry workers associated with these wart-causing chicken cancer viruses that may be transmitted to those in the general population handling fresh or frozen chicken (See Wart Cancer Viruses in Food). Last year I talked about the largest study at the time “confirming the findings of three other studies to date that workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants have increased risk of dying from certain cancers,” that also added penis cancer to the risks linked to poultry exposure (See Poultry and Penis Cancer). That was looking at 20,000 poultry workers. Well, we have yet another study, now looking at 30,000. The purpose of the study, profiled in my video, Poultry Tied to Liver and Pancreatic Cancer, was to test the hypothesis that exposure to poultry cancer-causing viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry workers—not to mention the general population—may be associated with increased risks of deaths from liver and pancreatic cancers. They found that those who slaughter chickens have about nine times the odds of both pancreatic cancer and liver cancer. Just to put this in context, the most carefully studied risk factor for pancreatic cancer, one of our deadliest cancers, is cigarette smoking. Even if we smoke for more than 50 years, though, we “only” about double our odds of pancreatic cancer. Those who slaughter poultry appear to have nearly nine times the odds. For liver cancer the most well-known and studied cause is alcohol. Those who consume more than four drinks a day have triple the odds of liver cancer. As with pancreatic cancer, poultry slaughtering appears to increase one’s odds of getting liver cancer nine-fold. Thus, the cancer-causing viruses in poultry may explain the increasing risk of death from liver and pancreatic cancers. There are diseases unique to the meat industry like the newly described “salami brusher’s disease” that affects those whose job it is to wire brush off the white mold that naturally grows on salami for eight hours a day, but most diseases suffered by meat workers are more universal. The reason the connection between asbestos and cancer was so easy to nail down is that asbestos caused a particularly unusual cancer, which was virtually unknown until there was widespread asbestos mining and industrial use. The pancreatic cancer one might get from handling chicken, however, is the same pancreatic cancer one might get smoking cigarettes, so it’s more difficult to tease out a cause-and-effect-relationship. Bottom line: despite the extremely high risks of deadly cancers, don’t expect an asbestos-type ban on Kentucky Fried Chicken anytime soon. I’ve addressed this topic before. See: It’s ironic that the meat industry wants to add viruses to meat (Viral Meat Spray) to combat fecal bacterial contamination. I’d take that over their other bright idea any day, though (Maggot Meat Spray). A human wart virus, HPV, can be combated with green tea (Treating Genital Warts with Green Tea), as well as by plant-based diets in general (Why Might Vegetarians Have Less HPV?). Although workers with the most poultry exposure appear to suffer the greatest excess mortality, increased deaths from cancer are also found in other slaughterhouse workers.

A-269	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/26/improving-attractiveness-in-six-weeks/	Improving Attractiveness in Six Weeks	Inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption may kill millions around the globe every year, so the public health community is not beyond “appealing to vanity.” How can we tell if someone’s healthy? You can look for that golden glow that comes from the carotenoids in fruits and vegetables, found to increase the attractiveness of African, Asian, and Caucasian faces. In my video, Eating Better to Look Better, you can see some “before-and-after” shots, before and after increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. Most think the pictures representing the greater fruit and veggie group appear healthier and more attractive. College students who went from three servings a day to the recommended minimum of nine servings a day for just six weeks were able to significantly improve their skin color, though it’s possible smaller dietary changes could help as well. Can’t we just swallow supplements instead of salads? See my video Produce, Not Pills, to Increase Physical Attractiveness. Public health advocates hope that research suggesting healthy eating may “affect mate choice and sexual selection” could provide a powerful message for promoting healthy eating. Their hope is to boost fruit and veggie intake up to 13 servings a day. And while a rosy glow associated with cardiovascular health in the face and lips can also increase one’s appearance of healthfulness and attractiveness, the color red can also reduce junk food intake. People drink less soda from cups with red stickers than from cups with blue stickers, and eat less from red plates than from blue or white plates. How crazy is that? Researchers speculate that it’s because our brains are subconsciously thinking “red traffic lights, stop-signs, red alert,” and therefore give us pause when we see the color red while eating. I previously covered this topic in Golden Glow and Rosy Glow, though I’m so glad we now have data from people of color as well. I’m certainly not above appealing to vanity. Whatever it takes to get people healthy.

A-270	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/24/want-to-be-healthier-change-your-taste-buds/	Want to be Healthier? Change your Taste Buds	How can we overcome our built-in hunger drives for salt, sugar, and fat? We now have evidence showing that if we go a few weeks cutting down on junk food and animal products, our tastes start to change. We may actually be able to taste fat—just like we taste sweet, sour, and salty—and people on low fat diets start liking low fat foods more and high fat foods less. Our tongues appear to become more sensitive to fat if we eat less of it. And the more sensitive our tongues become, the less butter, meat, dairy, and eggs study subjects ate. We also get a blunted taste for fat if we eat too much. This diminished fat sensitivity has been linked to eating more calories; more fat; more dairy, meat, and eggs; and becoming fatter ourselves. And this change in sensation, this numbing of our ability to taste fat, can happen within just a few weeks. In my video, Changing Our Taste Buds, you can see when researchers put people on a low-salt diet, over the ensuing weeks, study subjects like the taste of salt-free soup more and more, and the taste of salty soup less and less. Our tastes physically change. If we let them salt their own soup to taste, they add less and less the longer they’re on the diet. By the end, soup tastes just as salty with half the salt. For those who’ve been on sodium restricted diets, regularly salted foods taste too salty and they actually prefer less salty food. That’s why it’s important for doctors to explain to patients that a low-salt diet will gradually become more palatable as their taste for salt diminishes. The longer we eat healthier foods, the better they taste. That’s why I’ve always encouraged my patients to think of healthy eating as an experiment. I ask them to give it three weeks. The hope is by then they feel so much better (not only physically, but in the knowledge that they don’t have to be on medications for chronic diseases the rest of their lives after all!—see Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants) and their taste sensitivity has been boosted such that whole foods-as-grown regain their natural deliciousness. To see how a healthy diet can make you feel, check out the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine’s 21-Day Kickstart program at http://www.21daykickstart.org/. 	-	animal fat,animal products,body fat,butter,calories,cheese,dairy,eggs,fat,junk food,low-fat diets,meat,milk,obesity,salt,sodium,soup,sugar,taste buds,weight loss,yogurt	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-our-taste-buds/	http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/controlling-what-and-how-much-we-eat,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22384969,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3728360,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725716,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21757270,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21829156,http://www.21daykickstart.org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/changing-our-taste-buds/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-271	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/19/how-to-get-parents-to-eat-their-vegetables/	How to Get Parents to Eat their Vegetables	Changing the name of healthy foods can have a significant impact on children’s eating habits (See Tricks to Get Kids to Eat Healthier at School). Are adults as gullible? Yes. For example, in one study profiled in my video Tricks to Get Adults to Eat Healtier, people reported that “traditional Cajun red beans and rice” tasted better than just “red beans with rice,” even though they were both the exact same dish. (How healthy are those beans and rice, regardless of what you call them? Check out Beans and the Second Meal Effect). Back in World War II, domestic meat was in large part shipped overseas, leaving lots of organ meats behind—”the hearts, kidneys, brains, stomachs, intestines, and even the feet, ears, and heads of cows, hogs, sheep, and chickens.” The challenge was how to encourage people to eat chicken heads and sheep ears. To accomplish this, the Department of Defense evidently enlisted dozens of the brightest, most famous psychologists “to determine how dietary changes could be accomplished.” Taste wasn’t the problem. People would eat brains as long as you didn’t tell them they were eating brains. (What’s wrong with eating brains? See Avoiding Cholesterol Is a No-Brainer and Foodborne Rabies). Their solution was to invent mystery meat. The answer was to just not tell consumers what they’re eating. And the same can apply with healthy foods. As with organ meats in the 1940s, the suggestion that a food contains soy may be so powerful that some people convince themselves they do not like the taste. For instance, if someone is given an energy bar that says it has soy protein in it, people tend to rate it as grainy and tasteless, compared to identical bars with no mention of the word soy. In reality, there was no soy in either of the bars. It’s what you call a “phantom ingredient” taste test. “Simply the suggested presence of soy made people believe they tasted it, and they evaluated it accordingly.” (Does soy deserve its bad rap? See Breast Cancer Survival and Soy, for example. They may be overrated in the cholesterol-lowering department, though: Soy Worth a Hill of Beans?). In general, “a large percentage of consumers taste what they want to taste.” So can we use the same vegetable sneak attack tactic that has been proven so successful in children on adults?  It turns out that covertly adding hidden pureed vegetables to meals works for adults too—and even for vegetables they didn’t like. “It was shown that the adults’ dislike of the vegetables that were incorporated into the entrees did not affect the consumption of the vegetable-enhanced entrees. This indicates that the incorporation of pureed vegetables into entrees increased the intake of vegetables even when the added vegetable was disliked.” And of course, the more vegetables we eat, the less calories we get, so we get the twin benefit. Study subjects were eating up to a pound of vegetables a day and 350 fewer calories. Keep that up and one could lose 30 pounds a year without even trying. Another way to entice men and women to eat healthier is to appeal to their concerns about sexual function (see 50 Shades of Greens) or vanity: For related videos, check out Tricks to Get Kids to Eat Healthier at Home and school. 	-	animal products,beans,beef,beef brains,body fat,brains,calories,chicken,children,Cooking methods,fat,meat,obesity,offal,organ meats,plant protein,pork,pork brains,poultry,protein,rice,sheep,soy,soy milk,soybeans,U.S. Department of Defense,veal brains,vegetables,weight loss	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-home/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-adults-to-eat-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775554,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/foodborne-rabies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-home/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-adults-to-eat-healthier/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/pdf/permission/2002/Soy_Labels_Taste_2002.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/376759,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/pdf/pre-prints/Restaurants-2005.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/	
A-272	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/17/how-to-get-our-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/	How To Get our Kids to Eat their Vegetables	When researchers offered kids broccoli or a chocolate bar, which do you think they picked? Four out of five picked the chocolate (though how proud are the parents of the one in five kids that chose the broccoli?!). But what if we put an Elmo sticker on the broccoli? When an Elmo sticker was placed on the broccoli, it was half and half. Fifty percent chose the broccoli. It works in schools, too. A picture of SpongeBob saying, “Got beans?” and 37% more boys and 17% more girls chose green beans. One little sign and kids were eating significantly more vegetables. We saw how we should cut up (or cut out) cookies to minimize consumption in my video Tricks to Get Kids to Eat Healthier at School. How should we cut up vegetables to maximize consumption? Which do you think 9 to 12 year olds ate more of, whole slices, sticks or stars? And do they like them bigger, or smaller? The results were strikingly clear. Turns out “Shape was very influential; children clearly preferred having their vegetables cut.” Stars were liked the most. What about whole slices versus sticks? No difference. It turns out that size only mattered for the whole chunk: the ordinary size was preferred to the miniature versions. If they’re still not biting, we can apply the same trick I use to get our dog to eat stuff she doesn’t like: dip it in peanut butter. “Pairing vegetables with peanut butter may successfully increase intake, even in vegetable-resistant children.” Offering a salad dressing dip may help, too. Then there’s always the hidden vegetables strategy.  In one study, “broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini were covertly added to familiar entrees so that the appearance, flavor, and texture of the original recipes were maintained,” like pureeing vegetables into a pasta sauce, and families weren’t any wiser. Covertly incorporating vegetables into foods can “have a beneficial effect on children’s vegetable intake, but it should not be the only way that vegetables are served to children.”  Since the appetite for an initially unappetizing vegetable can be increased through repeated exposure, it is important to use several strategies to ensure that children experience different forms of vegetables, especially whole vegetables, because they’re not always going to be at home. Worse comes to worst, public health advocates can make a video game. There’s a public/private partnership, “The Quest to Lava Mountain,” where you can apparently harvest kale and gain “knowledge about the health benefits of eating healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods” as well as the detrimental effects of eating junk. Where were the kale video games when I was growing up? What may be the best way, though, to get kids to eat more fruits and vegetables? One study, featured in my video Tricks to Get Kids to Eat Healthier at Home, looked at all sorts of parenting styles—should we pressure them or should we lay off? What was the most important factor? The most important predictor of children’s fruit consumption was… the parent‘s consumption. That was pretty much the case with vegetables, too. If we want our kids to eat healthy, we have to model healthy behavior. The researchers concluded that in order to try to increase children’s fruit and vegetable consumption, parents should be guided to improve their own diets first.

A-273	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/12/how-to-get-kids-to-eat-their-vegetables/	How to Get Kids to Eat their Vegetables	What happens if we give one group of kids a plate of cookies and the other group the same number of cookies, but cut in half, and tell both groups they can eat as many as they want? Researchers reported that decreasing cookie size led to 25% fewer cookie calories eaten. The goal of that study was to help counter obesity-promoting eating behaviors facilitated by the availability of large portions of junk food. The findings “suggest that reducing the size of cookies (without altering the total amount of food) decreases children’s short-term caloric intake,” a dietary strategy for parents to discreetly decrease unhealthy behaviors. But they were using sugar wafers– what’s in those things? Partially hydrogenated oil (trans fats). What’s so bad about trans fats? See Trans Fat in Meat and Dairy, Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero, and Breast Cancer Survival and Trans Fat. No one should be eating those cookies. In fact, I can think of another “dietary strategy” to decrease kid’s intake—don’t give them any! Admittedly, this is easier said than done. Even in the ‘granola crunchy’ San Francisco Bay Area, a proposed ban on junk food suggested by parents and school administrators sent a faction of teachers into an apoplectic fit. In Texas, there was so much parental outrage that they got lawmakers to pass a Safe Cupcake Amendment. The amendment, known as Lauren’s Law, ensures that parents and grandparents of schoolchildren celebrating a birthday can bring whatever they want to school. Fine. What if we just offered fruit in addition to the cupcakes at classroom celebrations? In a study outlined in my video, Tricks to Get Kids to Eat Healthier at School, researchers provided bowls of fresh, cut-up fruit in addition to the party food brought by the parents at two of four kindergarten or preschool celebrations to observe student response. No special effort was made to encourage students to choose the fruit: they just put it out there. Would kids actually eat fruit when there was birthday cake, ice cream, and cheese puffs taking up nearly a whopping third of their daily caloric intake? Yes! On average each kid ate a full fruit serving. Take that, cheesy puffs! There are entire curricula available now for schools, such as “Veggiecation,” where for a whole year classrooms feature a new “veggie of the month,” sprinkled with nutrition mantras like ”Fiber equals a happy tummy.” And they work! “The active engagement of students in tasting and rating vegetable dishes seemed to have contributed to higher consumption of featured vegetables.” One school was able in some cases to double vegetable consumption just by giving them attractive names. Elementary students ate twice the number of carrots if they were called “X-ray Vision Carrots,” compared to when they were just “carrots” or generically named “Food of the Day.” How about “Power Punch Broccoli, Silly Dilly Green Beans, or Tiny Tasty Tree Tops?” Selection of broccoli increased by 109.4%, and green beans by 177%. Conclusion: “these studies demonstrate that using an attractive name to describe a healthy food in a cafeteria is robustly effective, persistent, and scalable with little or no money or experience. These names were not carefully crafted, discussed in focus groups, and then pre-tested.” They just thought them up out of thin air. And kids were suckered into eating healthier for months by putting out silly little signs. In this school, vegetable intake was up nearly 100%, while in the control school without signs, vegetable consumption started low and actually got worse. So why isn’t every single school in the country doing this right now?! Bring it up at your next PTA meeting. And if we want to get really bold, we can join the nutritious school lunch revolution led by pioneering organizations like the New York Coalition for Healthy School Food (check out their website at www.healthyschoolfood.org). Whenever I find myself frustrated by half measures, I am forced to remind myself just how SAD the Standard American Diet is. See Nation‘s Diet in Crisis for a reality check. One of the problems is that parents may not even realize there is a problem (Mothers Overestimate Dietary Quality).

A-274	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/10/food-dyes-and-adhd/	Food Dyes & ADHD	There are currently thousands of additives in our food supply. Some are good—like supplementing foods with vitamin B12, for example (See Vitamin B12 Necessary for Arterial Health). Other additives involve weighing the risks and benefits. Take nitrites in processed meats. Yes, they may increase our risk of cancer but, as preservatives, they decrease our risk of dying from botulism (See When Nitrates Go Bad and Bacon and Botulism). Then there are additives used for purely cosmetic purposes, like food dyes, used to provide color to colorless and “fun” foods. According to the FDA, “Without color additives, colas wouldn’t be brown, margarine wouldn’t be yellow and mint ice cream wouldn’t be green.” Heavens forbid! Color additives are now recognized as an important part of practically all processed foods we eat. Because we’re eating a lot more processed foods, we’re now getting five times more food dyes in our daily diet than we were 50 years ago. Fifteen million pounds of food dyes are used every year in foods, drugs, and cosmetics in the United States. I always wondered why they called them, for example, Blue #1 instead of their actual chemical name in the list of ingredients. Then, after reading this report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, I realized why. Picture a box of Kraft mac and cheese. It has Yellow #5. Would people be as likely to buy this product if instead of Yellow #5 it listed Trisodium 1-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-4-(4-sulfonatophenylazo)-5-(pyrazolone-3-carboxylate) on the label? The list of food dyes used to be longer (See Artificial Food Colors and ADHD), but different dyes kept getting banned—including Violet #1, which, ironically, was the color used in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s meat inspection stamp, so they may have been actually further cancer-ing up the meat. Years ago I featured a landmark study in my video Are Artificial Colors Bad for You?, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge in perhaps the most prestigious medical journal in the world. It showed that artificial colors increased “inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity among young children.” So what happened? Well, the British government said, OK, there’re no health benefits to these dyes, only health risks, so it’s a no-brainer. They mandated that food manufacturers remove most of the artificial food colors from products. In fact, the whole European Union said that if manufacturers want to keep using the dyes, then they have to put a warning label stating: “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.” Many international food companies have taken them out of their products in Europe, but continue to use them in the same products here in the U.S. where similar regulations are not currently in place. Why did the U.S. government take steps to get rid of them as well? The FDA put together a committee that looked at the landmark study and conceded that the food additives may have resulted in changes in behavior, but the “type of treatment effects reported in the study, even though the investigators referred to increases in levels of ‘hyperactivity,’ were not the disruptive excessive hyperactivity behaviors of ADHD but more likely the type of over-activity exhibited occasionally by the general population of preschool and school age children.” A distinguished toxicologist basically responded, “look, low level lead exposure may only shave off a few IQ points off of kids, but just because they’d still fall within a normal range, doesn’t mean it’s OK to expose it to our kids.” And looking back now, the lead in leaded gas may have been causing brain cancer and possibly even urban violence—the aggravated assault rate in cities around the U.S. seemed to closely follow the lead levels in the air. The Center for Science in the Public Interest continues to call on the FDA to ban food dyes and for food companies to voluntarily stop using them. Good luck with that. In the meantime, some researchers recently suggested a way to see which food colors may be damaging our child’s brain, advising parents to test artificial colors by purchasing little bottles of food dyes at the grocery store. Then have their kid do some homework or something and then have them chug down an artificial color and see if it affects their handwriting/reading/math at 30 minutes, at 90 minutes, and 3 hours. They also see if they get irritable later, have problems sleeping, and so on. If that’s OK, they say you should try even more to see if more will mess with their mind. If I may offer an alternate suggestion, maybe we shouldn’t buy our kids processed junk in the first place. This whole saga reminds me of the artificial flavor in my video Butter-Flavored Microwave Popcorn or Breathing. It’s amazing what the food industry is able to get away with. There’s even sometimes Artificial Coloring in Fish. There is a campaign to get Kraft to remove yellow #5 from their mac & cheese, but even if the stuff didn’t glow in the dark it’s still just a blob of sodium (750 mg), saturated fat (4.5 g), and trans fat (2.8 g). The food movement might better spend its time encouraging healthier fare altogether. 	-	ADHD,artificial colors,attention deficit,botulism,brain health,brain tumors,cancer,Center for Science in the Public Interest,children,Coca Cola,cola,Europe,FDA,food additives,food dyes,heavy metals,hyperactivity,ice cream,Kraft,lead,margarine,nitrite preservatives,processed foods,processed meat,sleep,United Kingdom,USDA,vitamin B12	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-home/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261956/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-home/,http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/FoodAdvisoryCommittee/UCM248113.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-coloring-in-fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tricks-to-get-kids-to-eat-healthier-at-school/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821291,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21729092,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17825405,http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/ucm094249.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-b12-necessary-for-arterial-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/artificial-food-colors-and-adhd/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21127082,http://cspinet.org/new/pdf/food-dyes-rainbow-of-risks.pdf	
A-275	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/05/dr-gregers-new-nutrition-dvd-now-available/	Dr. Greger’s New Nutrition DVD Now Available	Exciting news! I just signed a book deal with a new non-fiction division of famed science publisher Macmillan. The book is provisionally entitled How Not to Die: Simple Secrets for Longer Living. The manuscript is due by March 2015, so the 9 month gestation starts this week! That’s the good news. The bad news is that with a new book project taking over my life I may have to scale back on new videos for NutritionFacts.org. I’m already reaching millions through the website, but a smash bestseller could expose this life-changing, life-saving research to millions more. All proceeds from the sales of the book will go to charity, the 501c3 nonprofit organization that keeps NutritionFacts.org up and running, as does all the money I receive for speaking engagements and DVD sales. And speaking of DVDs… the newest volume of my Latest in Clinical Nutrition DVD series is now available. Order on my website or through Amazon (all proceeds go to the 501c3 nonprofit charity that keeps NutritionFacts.org thriving). It can also be ordered as an instant video download. The current batch of videos from volume 18 on NutritionFacts.org just ran out, so starting this month and running through until August, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 19. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–40+ hours of video–I have a special on my complete DVD collection. Here’s the list of chapters from the new volume 19 DVD — a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org: Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads. Anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both–your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs. If you’re already signed up and didn’t receive your volume 19 yet, please email Tommasina at Tommasina@NutritionFacts.org and she’ll make everything all better. 	-	DVD	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://smile.amazon.com/Latest-Clinical-Nutrition-Michael-Greger/dp/B00KH38TSU/&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20,http://www.drgreger.org/downloads,http://www.DrGreger.org/downloads,http://smile.amazon.com/Latest-Clinical-Nutrition-Michael-Greger/dp/B00KH38TSU/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/08/volume18/,http://www.drgreger.org/DVDs,http://www.drgreger.org/dvds	
A-276	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/03/how-to-treat-adhd-without-drugs/	How to Treat ADHD without Drugs	Every year in the United States, doctors write 20 million prescriptions for stimulants like Ritalin for kids with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Every year the number of prescriptions rises, more so than any other drug class—another 800,000 added every year to that 20 million. That’s a lot of amphetamines for a lot of kids. These drugs are thought to act by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. Guess what else can increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels? Exercise. And it happens within minutes of getting on a bike—dopamine and norepinephrine levels shoot up. Medications take an hour to work; physical activity works almost immediately. But does it work for ADHD? According to the latest review, outlined in my video Treating ADHD Without Stimulants, there isn’t a lot of research out there. But the current evidence suggests that both acute and chronic physical activity can mitigate ADHD symptoms. So while medications and exercise “both work to more adequately regulate dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain,” some of the new long-acting formulations of drugs can work for up to 12 hours, whereas the therapeutic effect of exercise may last for only an hour or so. But the drugs produce unwanted side effects and have the potential for abuse. Exercise has been shown to be effective in controlling ADHD symptoms and has essentially no side effects. However, the authors of the review conclude, that’s not really the full story, as “it should be noted that a major difference in the two treatment modalities is that medications have a defined effect on ADHD symptoms alone, whereas exercise produces physical, mental, and emotional advantages that are far-reaching.” Exercise can strengthen cancer defenses (Exercise & Breast Cancer and Is It the Diet, the Exercise, or Both?), improve cognition (Reversing Cognitive Decline), and lengthen one’s lifespan (What Women Should Eat to Live Longer). So exercise does have side effects, but they’re all good. 	-	addiction,ADHD,alternative medicine,amphetamines,attention deficit,brain health,children,complementary medicine,dopamine,exercise,hyperactivity,medications,mental health,Ritalin,side effects	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/exercise-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-adhd-without-stimulants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-cognitive-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-a-drink-of-water-make-children-smarter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/	http://ajl.sagepub.com/content/6/4/306.abstract?rss=1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21281664,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-adhd-without-stimulants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reversing-cognitive-decline/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-a-drink-of-water-make-children-smarter/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-gargling-prevent-the-common-cold/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/exercise-breast-cancer/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/502747,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711728,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/	
A-277	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/29/avoid-butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn/	Avoid Butter-Flavored Microwave Popcorn	What does chemical warfare and microwave popcorn have in common? The poison gas phosgene, first used extensively as a chemical warfare agent during World War I, can cause a horrific lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans. Bronchiolitis obliterans causes our small airways (bronchioles) to become obliterated, a generally irreversible and fatal condition that may also be caused by butter-flavored microwave popcorn. I’ve warned previously about diacetyl, the artificial butter flavoring being linked to a condition known as “popcorn lung,” where workers who had been exposed to diacetyl started dying. It turns out that the industry knew about the dangers for decades, but covered it up. Even when the industry admitted workers were dying, they swore the chemical was safe for consumers—that it was only an occupational health hazard.  Orville Redenbacher continued to have ads telling consumers to breathe deeply. I quipped in my video Is Artificial Butter Flavor Harmful? that any ingredient requiring the use of a gas mask is probably not something we want to feed our family. I wanted to err on the side of caution and I’m glad I did. In my video, Butter-Flavored Microwave Popcorn or Breathing, I profile a series of cases of butter-flavored microwave popcorn consumers developing bronchiolitis obliterans: The chemical is found in real butter, too, but it’s heavily concentrated when added as a flavoring. Tragically, it remains on store shelves and legal to this day. The regulation of health hazards from food additives has simply “fallen between the regulatory and health surveillance cracks,” the authors of the case series lament. They recommend a series of steps to protect consumers, such as allowing the bag to cool completely before opening (but who wants cold popcorn?) and then opening in a well-ventilated area away from the face. One solution they didn’t mention that would also eliminate the risk of lung disease? Don’t buy it. To understand how this could have happened you have to see my video Who Determines if Food Additives are Safe? What else can we do to protect our lungs? Meat safety is another example of regulatory breakdown. See, for example, Drug Residues in Meat, Deadly But Not Illegal and Past the Age of Miracles. What about food dyes? See Are Artificial Colors Bad for You? and Treating ADHD Without Stimulants. 	-	artificial flavors,bronchiolitis obliterans,butter,butter flavor,diacetyl,FDA,food additives,industry influence,lung disease,lung health,microwaving,mortality,Orville Redenbacher,phosgene,popcorn,popcorn lung,safety limits,smoking	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-artificial-butter-flavor-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-determines-if-food-additives-are-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/past-the-age-of-miracles-facing-a-post-antibiotic-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-adhd-without-stimulants/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17427353,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-artificial-butter-flavor-harmful/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12151475,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22550695,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-adhd-without-stimulants/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/butter-flavored-microwave-popcorn-or-breathing,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-determines-if-food-additives-are-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-bad-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/past-the-age-of-miracles-facing-a-post-antibiotic-age/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/	
A-278	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/27/pistachios-may-help-erectile-dysfunction/	Pistachios May Help Erectile Dysfunction	Erectile dysfunction is a major cause of decreased quality of life in men—so much so that one early theory suggested that this may explain the link between impotence and heart attacks. Depression is a risk factor for coronary heart disease, and the thought was that men who couldn’t get it up become so depressed that they die of a broken heart. Now we know that erectile dysfunction and heart disease can be two different manifestations of the exact same root problem, diseased arteries—inflamed, oxidized, cholesterol-clogged blood vessels (See Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death). So it’s no wonder that a diet chock-full of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cholesterol-lowering plant foods would improve sexual functioning in both men and women, as well as reduce the risk of heart disease (See 50 Shades of Green). A completely plant-based diet can even stop and reverse our number one killer (See One in a Thousand: Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic). Of all the plant foods individually examined so far, nuts appear most tied to longevity. Just two handfuls a week may extend a woman’s life as much as jogging four hours a week (see What Women Should Eat to Live Longer). So, if nuts reduce the risk of heart disease, might they also help with sexual dysfunction? In my video, Pistachio Nuts for Erectile Dysfunction I outline a study where men eating three to four handfuls of pistachios a day for just three weeks experienced both significant improvement in blood flow through the penis and significantly firmer erections. This is not surprising. Antioxidant-rich foods have a Viagra-like effect of boosting nitric oxide production. (See The Power of NO). Also, the citruline in watermelons helped with erection firmness by boosting arginine, (See Watermelon as Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction), which is what our body makes nitric oxide out of.Pistachios have a bunch of both antioxidants and arginine, which may help explain the improvement in blood flow. We also know that cholesterol is an important predictor of sexual dysfunction in both men and women (See Cholesterol and Female Sexual Dysfunction), and after just three weeks, those eating pistachios had significant improvements in cholesterol. And like other studies that piled on hundreds of calories of nuts a day, there was no weight gain. (For more on this remarkable effect, see my videos Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence, Solving the Mystery of the Missing Calories, and Testing the Pistachio Principle). Conclusion: “Just three weeks of pistachios resulted in a significant improvement in erectile function with additional improvement in cholesterol without any side effects.” Note the two important differences between diet and drugs. Drugs like Viagra just cover up the symptoms of the underlying problem–unhealthy arteries. Eating whole healthy plant foods like nuts actually helps attack the root cause—cholesterol, oxidation, and inflammation—and has only good side effects. The enzyme that Viagra-like drugs inhibit is found primarily in two places in the body: the erectile tissue of the penis and the retina of the eye. That’s why the FDA encourages people to stop taking drugs like Viagra, and “call a doctor right away if you experience sudden loss of vision.” (Assuming you can still find your phone.) Though the harms (such as cyanopsia in which everything in our vision suddenly becomes tinted blue) tend to be self-limited and reversible, why risk side-effects at all when the problem can be reversed and cured in the first place, improving the quality and quantity of our lives? I discuss the epidemic of adverse prescription drug side-effects in my 2012-13 annual review Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death and my new 2013-14 live presentation More Than an Apple a Day: Combating Common Diseases. In addition to improving penile blood flow, nuts may also help prevent breast cancer (Tree Nuts or Peanuts for Breast Cancer Prevention?), inflammatory diseases (Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell), sudden death (How Do Nuts Prevent Sudden Cardiac Death?), and lengthen one’s lifespan (Nuts May Help Prevent Death). 	-	antioxidants,arginine,calories,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,cholesterol,citruline,cyanopsia,depression,erectile dysfunction,exercise,eye health,FDA,heart disease,heart health,impotence,inflammation,LDL cholesterol,longevity,medications,men's health,mortality,nitric oxide,nuts,oxidative stress,penis health,phytosterols,pistachios,plant-based diets,sexual dysfunction,sexual health,side effects,vegans,vegetarians,viagra,watermelon,weight loss,women's health	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-power-of-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-nuts-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-power-of-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-nuts-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624550,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-may-help-prevent-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tree-nuts-or-peanuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798391,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395320,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/one-in-a-thousand-ending-the-heart-disease-epidemic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920268,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135028,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19592078,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771280,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228801	
A-279	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/22/foods-for-a-long-life-and-love-life/	Foods for a Long Life & Love Life	Motivating patients to change poor lifestyle habits can be extremely difficult. Preventing cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes is a relatively distant benefit, whereas barbecued ribs, cheesecake, or sitting on our butts promises almost instant gratification. Public health experts are now hoping that prevention or improvement of erectile dysfunction could be a more immediate motivator that physicians can use to improve their patients’ lifestyles and in turn their overall cardiovascular health. That’s how doctors can save a life during a clinic visit for erectile dysfunction. (See Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death). We used to think of erectile dysfunction in young men in their 20s and 30s as psychogenic in origin, meaning it’s all in their heads. But now we’re realizing it’s more likely an early sign of vascular disease. But even when the penis heads in the wrong direction, the heart need not follow. Atherosclerosis in both organs can be reversed with lifestyle changes. We know that “a substantial body of knowledge demonstrates that the abundant consumption of vegetables, fruit, and whole grain, and the dietary patterns rich in these foods, convey a markedly lower risk of coronary disease.” In a study profiled in my video, 50 Shades of Green, a group of researchers tried putting impotent men on a Mediterranean diet, which includes an abundance of plant-based foods. After two years on the Mediterranean diet, 37% of the men regained normal sexual function. What is it about the diet that appeared to do it? Improvements in erectile function were tied to five things: increased intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and essentially the ratio of plant fats to animal fats. Similar benefits were found for women. The same kind of diet significantly improved sexual function, together with a significant reduction of systemic inflammation. As a whole, these findings “suggest that a Mediterranean-style diet may be a safe strategy for amelioration of sexual function” in women with pre-diabetes or diabetes, who found significant improvement in sexual satisfaction on the healthier diet. For more on preventing sexual dysfunction in women in the first place, see Cholesterol and Female Sexual Dysfunction. The improvement in sexual functioning is thought to be because of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits of plant-based diet. Check out my related video: Pistachio Nuts for Erectile Dysfunction. Other benefits of increased fiber intake may include improved bowel function (Bristol Stool Scale) and frequency (Prunes vs. Metamucil vs. Vegan Diet), lower colorectal cancer risk (Stool Size Matters), lower breast cancer risk (Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen and Fiber vs. Breast Cancer), lower blood pressure (Whole Grains May Work as Well as Drugs), lower blood cholesterol (How Fiber Lowers Cholesterol), weight loss (Beans and the Second Meal Effect) and a longer lifespan (What Women Should Eat to Live Longer). 	-	animal fat,animal products,antioxidants,beans,cake,cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,dairy,diabetes,erectile dysfunction,fat,fiber,fruit,grains,greens,heart disease,heart health,impotence,inflammation,meat,Mediterranean diet,men's health,mental health,nuts,penis health,plant-based diets,prediabetes,sexual dysfunction,sexual health,stroke,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,women's health	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whole-grains-may-work-as-well-as-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fiber-vs-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fiber-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395320,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20214715,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19693019,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/survival-of-the-firmest-erectile-dysfunction-and-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22519624,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whole-grains-may-work-as-well-as-drugs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pistachio-nuts-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624550,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/50-shades-of-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fiber-vs-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fiber-lowers-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21911624,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	
A-280	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/20/pills-vs-diet-for-erectile-dysfunction/	Pills vs. Diet for Erectile Dysfunction	Erectile dysfunction is the recurrent or persistent inability to attain and/or maintain an erection in order for satisfactory sexual performance. It is present in up to 30 million men in the U.S. and approximately 100 million men worldwide. The U.S. has less than 8% of the world’s population, yet up to 30% of the impotence? We’re #1! But hey, we’ve got red, white, and blue pills like Viagra. The problem is that the pills just cover up the symptoms of vascular disease and don’t do anything for the underlying pathology. Erectile dysfunction and our #1 killer, coronary artery disease, are just two manifestations of the same disease: inflamed, clogged, and crippled arteries, regardless of which organ it affects (See Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death). Atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disorder that uniformly affects all major blood vessels in the body. Hardening of the arteries can lead to softening of the penis because stiffened arteries can’t relax, open wide, and let the blood flow. Thus erectile dysfunction may just be the flaccid “tip of an iceberg” in terms of a systemic disorder. For two-thirds of men showing up to emergency rooms for the first time with crushing chest pain, their penis had been trying to warn them for years that something was wrong with their circulation. Why does it hit the penis first? Because the penile arteries in the penis are half the size of the coronary artery in our heart. So the amount of plaque we wouldn’t even feel in the heart could clog half the penile artery, causing symptomatic restriction in blood flow. That’s why erectile dysfunction has been called “penile angina.” In fact, by measuring blood flow in a man’s penis we can predict the results of his cardiac stress test with an accuracy of 80%. Male sexual function is like a penile stress test, a “window into the hearts of men.” Forty percent of men over age forty have erectile dysfunction. 40 over 40. Men with erection difficulties in their 40s have a 50-fold increased risk of having a cardiac event (like sudden death). I said before that various things increase heart disease risk by 20% or 30%. That’s nearly 5000%, leading the latest review to ask, “is there any risk greater?” That’s because it’s not so much a risk factor for atherosclerosis as atherosclerosis itself. A man “with erectile dysfunction (even if he doesn’t have cardiac symptoms) should be considered a cardiac patient until proven otherwise.” Erectile dysfunction is considered to be a cardiac equivalent; it’s a marker of the coronary artery one likely already has. Thus, there’s more to treating ED than establishing an erect penis; it offers an opportunity for reducing cardiovascular risk. The reason even young men should care about their cholesterol is because it predicts erectile dysfunction later in life, which in turn predicts heart attacks, strokes, and a shortened lifespan. Thankfully, Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped. Check out my video on Eliminating the #1 Cause of Death. More background can be found in Arterial Acne and Blocking the First Step of Heart Disease.

A-281	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/	Which Seaweed to Help Prevent Breast Cancer?	Sushi lovers, rejoice. Nori seaweed may favorably alter estrogen metabolism by modulating women’s gut flora, resulting in decreased breast cancer risk. As traditional East Asian diets have westernized, breast cancer rates have risen. Some researchers have linked this to a quadrupling of animal product consumption. In my video Which Seaweed Is Most Protective Against Breast Cancer, you can see the breast cancer rate of Japanese women living in Japan. Within 10 years of immigrating to the United States, their risk increases, and if they hang around long enough, their risk goes up even more, although it is still somewhat lower than the U.S. national average. This may be because of some of the dietary habits they carry with them—soy and green tea consumption, perhaps eating more mushrooms and seaweed. We’ve known for over a decade that in vitro (in a Petri dish) seaweed broth is effective at clearing cancer cells. In the video, you can see three different types of human breast cancer exposed to either a widely used chemotherapy drug or a sea vegetable. The seaweed worked better. And unlike the chemo, it didn’t hurt normal, non-cancerous breast cells. What about outside of the test tube, in people? Well, a population study comparing women with breast cancer to women without found that consuming a single sheet of nori a day may cut a woman’s odds of breast cancer in half. We think it’s because seaweed favorably alters estrogen metabolism, likely due to modulating women’s gut bacteria. The more seaweed we eat, the less estrogen we have in our system, which may lower breast cancer risk. The breast cancer protection may be because of all the fiber in sea vegetables, or because seaweed may block the enzyme that undermines our body’s attempt to flush out excess hormones. Or seaweed may somehow interfere with estrogen binding to estrogen receptors. Whatever the cause, to effectively lower their estrogen levels, Asian women may be able to get away with about one sheet of nori a day, but American women are physically so much larger that it may take closer to two. There are lots of yummy seaweed snacks out there to make it a tasty experience—just try to get some low-fat, low-sodium ones. They’re just like kale chips, munchies made out of dark green leafy vegetables—can’t beat that! For more on lowering breast cancer through diet: The seaweed used fresh in seaweed salads, wakame, unfortunately did not appear to reduce breast cancer risk. Wakame consumption has, however, been found to lower blood pressure in hypertensives (people with high blood pressure). Just two teaspoons of seaweed salad a day for a month dropped people’s blood pressure 14 points, and two months of wakame was associated with up to a two inch skinnier waistline. As I’ve mentioned before, I’d recommend avoiding hijike, which tends to have too much arsenic (see Avoiding Iodine Deficiency), and kelp, which tends to have too much iodine (see Too Much Iodine Can Be as Bad as Too Little). In fact, too much seaweed of any type may actually increase our risk for thyroid cancer because of the amount of iodine we’d be taking in, but there does not appear to be any increased risk at the levels of consumption I’m talking about, like a sheet of nori every day. And a study of seaweed eaters in California actually found decreased risk, but, again, we’re talking a modest level of intake. I’ve frequently talked about the benefits of dietary diversity, eating different families of fruits and vegetables, eating different parts of individual plants—such as beets and beet greens. If we just stick to land plants, though, we’re missing out on all the plants from the other 70% of planet earth. Sea vegetables have phytonutrients found nowhere else, special types of fiber, and unique carotenoids and polysaccharides, and various polyphenol defense compounds, each of which may have anti-cancer properties. I encourage everyone to try experimenting until you find a sea vegetable you like, even if that means just sprinkling some powdered dulse on your food. More on the importance of dietary diversity in Garden Variety Anti-Inflammation, Apples and Oranges: Dietary Diversity, and Constructing a Cognitive Portfolio.

A-282	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/13/preloading-with-watercress-before-exercise/	Preloading with Watercress before Exercise	Could exercise be creating harmful free radicals? Oxidizing glucose to produce energy for our bodies is messy, creating free radicals the way cars burning their fuel produce combustion by-products out the exhaust. This happens even if we’re just idling, living our day-to-day lives. What if we rev our bodies up and start exercising and really start burning fuel? Then we create more free radicals, more oxidative stress, and so, need to eat even more antioxidant-rich foods. Why do we care about oxidative stress? Well, it’s “implicated in virtually every known human disease and there is an increasing body of evidence linking free radical production to the process of aging.” Why? Because free radicals can damage DNA, our very genetic code. Well, if free radicals damage DNA, and exercise creates free radicals, does exercise damage our DNA if we don’t have enough antioxidants in our system to douse the radicals? Yes, in fact, ultra-marathoners show evidence of DNA damage in about 10% of their cells tested during a race, which may last for up to two weeks after a marathon. But what about just short bouts of exercise? We didn’t know until recently. After just five minutes of moderate or intense cycling we can get an uptick in DNA damage. We think it’s the oxidative stress, but “regardless of the mechanism of exercise-induced DNA damage” the fact that a very short bout of high-intensity exercise can cause an increase in damage to DNA is a cause for concern. But we can block oxidative damage with antioxidant-rich foods. Of course, when drug and supplement companies hear “antioxidant-rich foods” they think, pills! We can’t make billions on broccoli, so “Pharmacological antioxidant vitamins have been investigated for a prophylactic effect against exercise-induced oxidative stress.” However, large doses are often required and in pill form may ironically lead to a state of pro-oxidation and even more oxidative damage. For example, guys doing arm curls taking 500 mg of vitamin C appeared to have more muscle damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress. So, instead of vitamin supplementation, how about supplementation with watercress, the badass of the broccoli family? What if, two hours before exercise, we eat a serving of raw watercress, then get thrown on a treadmill whose slope gets cranked up until we basically collapse? Athletes who didn’t preload with watercress before working out developed a certain amount of free radicals in their blood stream at rest and after exhaustive exercise (See Preventing Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress with Watercress), which is what we’d expect. If we eat a super-healthy antioxidant-packed plant food like watercress before we exercise can we blunt this effect? We actually end up better than we started! At rest, after the watercress, we may start out with fewer free radicals, but only when we stress our body to exhaustion can we see the watercress really flex its antioxidant muscle. What happens to DNA damage? Well, in a test tube, if we take some human blood cells bathed in free radicals, we can reduce the DNA damage it causes by 70% within minutes of dripping some watercress on them. But does that happen within the human body if we just eat it? If we exercise without watercress in our system, DNA damage shoots up, but if we’ve been eating a single serving a day for two months our body’s so juiced up on green leafy goodness that we get no significant damage after punishing ourself on the treadmill. So with a healthy diet, can we get all the benefits of strenuous exercise without the potential risks? Regular physical exercise is a key component of a healthy lifestyle, but it can elicit oxidative stress. To reduce that stress, some have suggested pills to improve one’s antioxidant defense system, but “those eating more plant-based diets may naturally have an enhanced antioxidant defense system” without eating pills to counter exercise-induced oxidative stress. Plant foods average 64 times more antioxidants than meat, fish, eggs, and dairy (See Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods). And on top of that, the animal protein itself can have pro-oxidant effects. Anyone eating sufficient quantities of whole healthy plant foods could plausibly reach an antioxidant status similar to vegetarians. It’s not just about what we’re eating less of – saturated fat and cholesterol – but what we’re eating more of, the phytonutrients. Whether it’s about training longer or living longer, we’ve got to eat more plants. I should do more videos on watercress! The only other one I think I have is Sometimes the Enzyme Myth Is True. Check out my other videos on enhancing athletic recovery times: Reducing Muscle Soreness With Berries and Reducing Muscle Fatigue With Citrus.

A-283	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/08/berries-to-prevent-muscle-soreness/	Berries to Prevent Muscle Soreness	The burning sensation during strenuous exercise may be related to the build-up of lactic acid in our muscles (see Reducing Muscle Fatigue with Citrus), but that’s different than the delayed onset muscle soreness that occurs in the days following a bout of extreme physical activity. This post-exercise soreness is thought to be due to inflammation caused by muscle cell damage (little micro-tears in the muscle). If it’s an inflammatory reaction, then might anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help? The bioflavonoids in citrus might help with the lactic acid buildup, but we may need to ramp up to the anthocyanin flavonoids in berries to deal with the inflammation. We know, for example, that if we eat about 45 cherries a day we can significantly reduce the levels of inflammatory markers like c-reactive protein in our bloodstream. Mushrooms (Boosting Immunity While Reducing Inflammation), nuts (Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell), and purple potatoes (Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Purple Potatoes) may also reduce inflammation (along with plant foods in general, see Anti-Inflammatory Antioxidants and Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods) so much so that plant-based diets can be used to treat inflammatory conditions. See, for example, Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease, Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Potassium and Autoimmune Disease. Animal products on the other hand, may increase inflammation through a variety of mechanisms, including endotoxins (How Does Meat Cause Inflammation?), arachidonic acid (Chicken, Eggs, and Inflammation), and Neu5Gc (The Inflammatory Meat Molecule Neu5Gc). But what about reducing muscle soreness? Researchers took some guys and made them flex their biceps against way too much weight over and over and over again, the next day the strength in their arms is way down—about a 30% drop—and they suffered serous soreness (See Reducing Muscle Soreness with Berries). But if they were drinking some cherry juice, their arms ended up hurting less and they were able to better preserve their strength. Why not just feed them cherries? Because we can’t do a placebo group since we can’t really create a convincing fake cherry, but we can make fake cherry juice in the form of cherry Kool-Aid. This was “the first study to examine the effect of the consumption of any cherry product on the symptoms of exercise induced muscle damage,” and it seemed to work. Follow-up studies show it also works on reducing muscle pain in long-distance runners, speeding recovery after a marathon, considered “the holy grail of exercise science.” A similar study showing anti-inflammatory effects of eating blueberries took it a step further and actually paid athletes to take a muscle biopsy so they could see what’s happening to their muscles on a microscopic level. It’s like another study which showed how massage could decrease inflammation. At first I was like: “ooh, I wouldn’t mind being part of that study—free relaxing massage!” until I read the protocol: subjects got to rest a few minutes, then the scalpels come out and cut out some muscle samples. No thanks. And of course there are drugs—there are always drugs—but with drugs there are side effects. So the cherry study, as noted in an editorial comment, “may provide more of a sensible and realistic treatment option for those suffering from sore and damaged muscles. The scientific question of how to treat the damaged muscle is an important one, and these researchers should be applauded for finding a potential treatment that is not only practical, but one that can be enjoyed.” How about improving athletic performance more directly?

A-284	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/06/citrus-to-reduce-muscle-fatigue/	Citrus to Reduce Muscle Fatigue	The lactic acid that makes yogurt tangy is the same lactic acid that builds up in our muscles when we exercise strenuously. Instead of bacteria fermenting the sugar in milk to make energy for themselves, our muscles ferment sugar in our diet to produce energy to contract. If, like when we’re sprinting, lactic acid builds up in our muscles faster than it can be removed we can end up with a burning sensation in our muscles, forcing us to stop. Now if we train, we can increase the number of blood vessels in our muscles and clear out the lactate faster. For example, when researchers took some overweight sedentary women and started them on an aerobic training program of running and walking, at the end of three months, their lactate levels during exercise dropped 17%. But those on the same program who drank two cups of orange juice a day dropped their levels 27%. They did the same exercise program, but the citrus group experienced a significant decrease in blood lactate concentration, indicating an improvement in physical performance with less muscle fatigue. I don’t recommend drinking juice, though, because we’re losing all that wonderful fiber that slows the rate of fruit sugar absorption into our system. In my video, Reducing Muscle Fatigue with Citrus, we can see the blood sugar spike one might expect after drinking Coca-Cola. Compare that to the spike we see with orange juice? No difference. However, if we eat the same quantity of sugar in the form of orange slices we experience a significantly smaller spike in blood sugar. So the whole fruit is nearly always better than fruit juice. Now this is not to say OJ isn’t better than coke. OJ has those citrus phytonutrients like hesperidin, which may be why the women’s triglycerides didn’t go up even though they were drinking two cups of fruit juice every day. Hesperidin may actually help lower our digestion of fats, but once we get up to three cups a day, we really can start bumping our triglycerides. The burning sensation during strenuous exercise may be related to the build-up of lactic acid in our muscles, but that’s different than the delayed onset muscle soreness that occurs in the days following a bout of extreme physical activity. That’s thought to be due to inflammation caused by muscle cell damage, little micro-tears in the muscle. If it’s an inflammatory reaction then might anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help? Find out in my video Reducing Muscle Soreness with Berries.

A-285	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/01/how-citrus-might-help-keep-your-hands-warm/	How Citrus Might Help Keep your Hands Warm	In 1936, Albert Szent-Györgyi, who won the Nobel Prize for discovering vitamin C, described a vitamin “P,” which we now know encompasses a class of thousands of phytonutrients called flavonoids. Some, like quercitin, are widespread in plant-based foods. We can tell something is widespread in the plant kingdom when one can even find it in iceberg lettuce! Others, however, are only found in specific plant families. For example, hesperidin is found primarily in citrus fruits. This may be one of the reasons that, out of all the different types of fruit that have been looked at, citrus may cut our risk of stroke the most. The citrus phytonutrient hesperidin increases blood flow. Using a machine called a Doppler fluximeter (sounds like something from Back to the Future) one can measure blood flow through the skin using a laser beam. When researchers give people the amount of hesperidin found in two cups of orange juice, blood flow goes up. It works even better when they gave them the orange juice itself, so there’s other beneficial stuff besides just the hesperidin in citrus. For example, if we measure the changes in genetic expression, orange juice consumption induces changes in the expression of 3000 of our genes, whereas hesperidin alone only modulated the expression of about 2000. Still, the fact that nearly 2000 stretches of our DNA expressed differently because we consumed just one of the thousands of phytonutrients in plants is pretty mind-blowing. These changes in blood flow are not just in theory. Researchers took volunteers with cold sensitivity (cold hands and feet), put them in an air-conditioned room and measured the temperature of their fingertips after drinking a placebo drink (like orange Kool-Aid) versus drinks with two doses of actual citrus phytonutrients. In the Kool-Aid group, their fingers got colder and colder, dropping nearly nine degrees Fahrenheit. The fingers of those consuming low or high doses of citrus didn’t get nearly as cold because their blood flow remained steady. In my video, Keeping Your Hands Warm with Citrus, we can see the laser test of the subject’s blood flow. When we’re exposed to cold temperatures our body starts to clamp off peripheral blood flow to keep our core warm, but if we eat a bunch of oranges before we go skiing our risk of frostbite may go down since we’re keeping up our blood flow to our fingers and toes. They even took these poor women and plunged their hands into some chilly water, and their finger temperature rebounded faster towards normal in the citrus group, demonstrating that citrus phytonutrients not only keep our extremities warmer but may also warm us back up faster. But don’t forget, don’t brush your teeth immediately after consuming citrus. We have to make sure to rinse our mouth with water and wait 30 minutes before brushing to protect our tooth enamel (see Plant-Based Diets: Dental Health). Because different families of fruits and vegetables can have entirely different phytonutrient profiles, variety is important. See, for example: Eating oranges is always better than drinking orange juice, as seen in my video Reducing Muscle Fatigue with Citrus. 	-	cardiovascular disease,cardiovascular health,citrus,cold hands,flavonoids,fruit,fruit juice,grapefruit,heart disease,heart health,hesperidin,juice,lemons,lettuce,limes,orange juice,oranges,phytonutrients,plant-based diets,quercitin,stroke,vitamin C	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10517425,http://www.care2.com/greenliving/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21068346,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22307524,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-fatigue-with-citrus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keeping-your-hands-warm-with-citrus/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110589,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22888839,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22741166,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-286	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/29/toxin-contamination-of-spirulina-supplements/	Toxin Contamination of Spirulina Supplements	On his first day of life, an infant was hospitalized with seizures. Researchers concluded that his mother’s daily spirulina use starting in the fourth month of pregnancy was likely to blame. I’ve talked previously about the liver and nerve toxins present in many spirulina supplements, but the supplement companies swear up and down that spirulina doesn’t produce those toxins, and they may be right (See my video Infant Seizures Linked to Mother’s Spirulina Use). But if spirulina doesn’t produce toxins, how is it that toxins are found in spirulina supplements on store shelves? It appears to be contamination of spirulina with toxin-producing blue-green algae. For example, if we look at the new U.S. Pharmacopeia safety evaluation of spirulina, researchers conclude that “the available evidence does not indicate a serious risk to health or other public health concern when spirulina is properly identified, formulated, and used.” Ah, but that’s the catch. Spirulina is often grown and collected in open lakes and we have no idea what other algae are going to crop up. The researchers reported a range of adverse reactions of people taking spirulina products, ­­but they attribute these issues to non-spirulina algae toxin contaminants within spirulina supplements. So unless there’s third-party testing of each batch (which no company could presumably afford to do), I continue to encourage people to avoid spirulina (and blue-green algae) products. If one still wants something green to sprinkle on their popcorn, I’d recommend chlorella instead (Is Chlorella Good for You?). I’ve previously addressed green powders in: Pregnancy is a very vulnerable time and requires an even higher level of dietary vigilance: Some supplements may be risky for everyone though. See, for example Safety of Noni and Mangosteen Juice. 	-	algae,blue-green algae,cancer,infants,liver disease,liver failure,liver health,natural toxins,nerve health,pregnancy,safety limits,seizures,side effects,spirulina,supplements	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safety-of-noni-and-mangosteen-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safety-of-noni-and-mangosteen-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/latest-on-blue-green-algae/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21842336,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21793723,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-seizures-linked-to-mothers-spirulina-use/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-287	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/24/is-noni-or-mangosteen-juice-safe/	Is Noni or Mangosteen Juice Safe?	There is now another case report of acute toxicity linked to noni juice ingestion, this time in a 14 year old. At least his liver didn’t fail completely like in two of the earlier cases. What do we expect from a product also known as “vomit fruit”? The multi-level marketing company that sells noni products blamed the aloe vera juice that the boy had also consumed, which is indeed something else I’d encourage folks not to drink. But what about all the scientific studies promoting these types of products bandied about on commercial websites? Recently, a public health researcher published a review on the “Science in Liquid Dietary Supplement Promotion,” evidently a $23 billion dollar market. The review describes how “Central to the marketing of many such products is the citation of ’scientific studies’ supporting the product’s health claims. While these studies seem deliberately created for marketing purposes, their findings and quality are generally presented in a manner that appears designed to mislead potential consumers.” The researcher uses the case of mangosteen juice—another product I’ve warned about in the past—as an “example of how widely marketed and consumed liquid dietary supplements use exaggeration and pseudoscience to bolster their web promotions of product effectiveness and safety.” The multilevel marketing company that sells mangosteen cited a study they paid for to support its assertion that their product is “shown to be safe at all dosages tested” and indeed “safe for everyone.” The study, profiled in my video, Safety of Noni and Mangosteen Juice, involved exposing just 30 people to their product, with another ten given placebo. With so few people exposed, the stuff could kill 1 or 2% of people and you’d never even know. For more on these two liquid supplements, check out my videos Is Noni Juice Good for You? and Is Mangosteen Juice Good for You? Noni and mangosteen juice aren’t the only supplements “proven safe” by dubious research. A study of the multi-level marketing supplement Metabolife had 35 people on the stuff and they seemed to do just fine.  Later, though, it had to be withdrawn from the market after being linked to 18 heart attacks, 26 strokes, 43 seizures and five deaths. Oops. Hydroxycut was studied on 40 people. No serious adverse effects in the study, but later the same thing: withdrawn after dozens of cases of organ damage including massive hepatic necrosis requiring liver transplants and death. And often times, in the multilevel marketing study researchers don’t disclose their funding sources, pretending to be objective scientists, but a little detective work exposed a whole web of financial conflicts of interest, “at best reducing the face-validity of findings, and at worst [they] represent deception.” Other beverages that might be good to avoid include alcohol (Breast Cancer and Alcohol: How Much Is Safe?), soft drinks (Is Sodium Benzoate Harmful?), yerba maté (Update on Yerba Maté), and kombucha (Is Kombucha Tea Good for You?). I prefer water (Does a Drink of Water Make Children Smarter?), white tea (Antimutagenic Activity of Green Versus White Tea), and hibiscus tea (Better Than Green Tea?).

A-288	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/22/should-carrageenan-be-avoided/	Should Carrageenan Be Avoided?	Six hundred years ago, people living along the coast of Carragheen County Ireland started using a red algae, which came to be known as Irish moss, to make a jellied dessert. This moss is now the source of carrageenan, a fat substitute (perhaps most famously used in the failed McLean Deluxe) and a food additive used as a thickener in dairy and nondairy products. In 2008 I raised a concern about carrageenan. We had known for decades that it had harmful effects on laboratory animals, but in 2008 the first study on human cells to “suggest that carrageenan exposure may have a role in development of human intestinal pathology” was conducted. This was all five years ago, though. What’s the update? (See Is Carrageenan Safe?) After the activation of inflammatory pathways was demonstrated in actual human colon tissue samples, Europe pulled it from infant formula, concerned that infants might be getting too much at such a vulnerable age. The latest suggests carrageenan consumption could possibly lead to a leaky gut by disrupting the integrity of the tight junctions that form around the cells lining our intestine—the barrier between our bloodstream and the outside world. This was just an in vitro study, though, done in a Petri dish. We still don’t know what effects, if any, occur in whole human beings. Some researchers advise consumers to select food products without carrageenan, accusing the FDA of “ignoring [its] harmful potential.” Personally, after having reviewed the available evidence, I continue to view carrageenan the way I view acrylamide, another potential, but unproven hazard. Acrylamide is a chemical formed by cooking carbohydrates at high temperatures. So should we avoid eating such foods, like the EPA suggests? Well, “Food safety concerns must also be considered [in the context of dietary] consequences.” Where’s it found the most? Foods that are already unhealthy. So sure, we can use our concern about the probable carcinogen,acrylamide as yet another reason to avoid potato chips and French fries, but until we know more I wouldn’t cut out healthful foods like whole grain bread. (For more on Acrylamide, see my video Acrylamide in French Fries). Similarly, I’d use potential concerns about carrageenan as additional motivation to avoid unhealthy foods like cream cheese, but I wouldn’t cut out healthful foods until we know more.

A-289	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/17/treating-menstrual-pain-with-diet/	Treating Menstrual Pain With Diet	Almost half of menstruating women experience painful, crampy periods, also known as dysmenorrhea. According to Dr. Linda French from Michigan State University College of Medicine, “despite the substantial effect on quality of life and general well-being, few women seek treatment, thinking it won’t help.” Treatments are available, though–modern medicine to the rescue! There are surgical options such as neuroablation, where surgeons go in and attempt to cut or destroy the nerves leading to the uterus, or doctors can just take out the uterus completely. There are of course a bunch of hormones in pills and shots that can suppress the menstrual cycle as well. Since the pain is caused by inflammation, anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen are the most commonly used, achieving symptomatic pain relief in about two thirds of women. While effective, women using them need to be aware of the significant risk as they may cause adverse side effects. Though there are a bunch of non-drug, non-surgical treatments like acupuncture, “the evidence for the effectiveness of these treatments is generally weak.” One of the latest advances in treatment involves the use of a single high dose of vitamin D. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study the placebo did nothing–in fact, most women got worse. But the women who got the vitamin D all felt better. For more on vitamin D, see my series justifying my vitamin D recommendations, starting with Vitamin D Recommendations Changed and ending with Resolving the Vitamin D-Bate. But wait a second. If it’s pain caused by inflammation, how about putting women on an anti-inflammatory diet? A study outlined in my video, Dietary Treatment for Painful Menstrual Periods, placed 33 women suffering from painful periods on a plant-based diet for two cycles. They experienced significant reductions in menstrual pain duration from four days down to three days and a significant reduction in pain intensity. Women also experienced improvement of PMS symptoms such as bloating. This was a crossover study, so after two months eating vegan, the women were supposed to go back to their regular diets to see if the pain would return. But the women felt so much better that when the researchers asked them to go back to their regular diet to test before and after, several women refused, even though they were required to by the study.  Doctors too often patronizingly think that patients simply won’t adhere to therapeutic diets, but when the women were surveyed, they reported having fewer cramps and were losing weight. They also reported increased energy, better digestion, and better sleep. This showed that we don’t have to be in some Ornish or Esselstyn study facing certain death after a heart attack to stick to a plant-based diet. It’s well accepted that even when testing more benign conditions. (For those unfamiliar with the work of Drs. Ornish and Esselstyn, see, for example, my video Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped or my blog post Heart Disease: There Is A Cure). I’ve touched on this body of work briefly in Plant-Based Diets for Breast Pain. Plants that may be especially helpful include flax seeds (Flax Seeds for Breast Pain) and the spice saffron (Saffron for the Treatment of PMS and Wake Up and Smell the Saffron). 	-	bloating,energy,hormones,Ibuprofen,inflammation,medications,menstruation,pain,plant-based diets,premenstrual syndrome,side effects,sleep,surgery,uterine health,vegans,vegetarians,vitamin D,weight loss,women's health	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/14/heart-disease-there-is-a-cure/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-for-painful-menstrual-periods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-recommendations-changed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resolving-the-vitamin-d-bate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wake-up-and-smell-the-saffron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/14/heart-disease-there-is-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14583938,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17230282,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10674588,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1108739,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-pms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-treatment-for-painful-menstrual-periods/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22586231,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-breast-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-recommendations-changed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resolving-the-vitamin-d-bate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wake-up-and-smell-the-saffron/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022318200705905,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15686299	
A-290	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/15/cayenne-for-irritable-bowel/	Cayenne for Irritable Bowel	Nearly 50 million Americans come down with food poisoning every year. Over a hundred thousand are hospitalized and thousands die every year just because of something they ate. If they had ordered something different on the menu or chosen something else at the grocery store, they or their loved one might be alive today. But in the vast majority of cases, food poisoning manifests itself as little more than a case of “stomach flu”—a few days of pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and then it’s gone. So what’s the big deal? Well, as described in this recent editorial in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, in many cases, that acute infection can trigger a chronic “postinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorder” that can last for years or even forever. The two most common of which are irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia (chronic indigestion). Up to 10% of people stricken with Salmonella, E. coli, or Campylobacter are left with irritable bowel syndrome. The thought is that the “transitory inflammation during the infection leads to subtle but permanent changes in the structure and function of the digestive system,” causing the lining of the gut to become hyper-sensitized. How do they determine if someone’s rectum is hypersensitive? Innovative Japanese researchers developed a device to deliver “repetitive painful rectal distention.” Basically, the researchers hooked up a half-quart balloon to a fancy bicycle pump that was lubricated with olive oil, inserted it into the rectum and inflated it until the patients couldn’t stand the pain anymore. As you can see in my video, Cayenne Pepper for Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Chronic Indigestion, those with IBS had a significantly lower pain threshold, significantly less “rectal compliance.” Healthy people felt the pain where we’d expect to feel the pain with, effectively, a balloon animal up their tush. But many with IBS also experienced abdominal pain, indicating a hypersensitivity of the entire gut wall. Well, if that’s the problem, how can we desensitize the gut? In my video, Hot Sauce in the Nose for Cluster Headaches?, we learned about the ability of hot pepper compounds to deplete pain fibers of substance P, a neurotransmitter used for transmitting pain. It’s bad enough to have to rub hot peppers up our nose, where do we have to stick them for irritable bowel? Thankfully researchers chose the oral route. The researchers concluded that “the chronic administration of red pepper powder in IBS patients with enteric-coated pills was significantly more effective than placebo in decreasing the intensity of abdominal pain and bloating, and was considered by the patients more effective than placebo,” suggesting a “novel way of dealing with this frequent and distressing functional disease.” After 48 million cases of annual food poisoning, 10% may end up with IBS. Even more may end up with chronic indigestion. How do peppers work against that? We can’t use whole peppers because then we couldn’t blind a placebo, but if we give capsules of red pepper powder to folks suffering from chronic indigestion—about one and a half teaspoons a day worth—and compare that to an identical-looking sugar pill, within a month their overall symptoms improved, including their stomach pain and their feelings of being bloated. They had less nausea, too. The frequently prescribed drug, Propulsid (cisapride), worked almost as well as the red pepper powder, and was considered generally well tolerated… that is, until it killed people. Propulsid was pulled from the market after causing dozens of deaths. I explore another natural treatment for IBS in Kiwi Fruit for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I’ve covered some of the long-term consequences of food poisoning in videos such as Poultry and Paralysis, Fecal Bacteria Survey, and Amnesic Seafood Poisoning.

A-291	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/10/natural-treatment-for-cluster-headaches/	Natural Treatment for Cluster Headaches	In a study “Secretion, Pain and Sneezing Induced by the Application of Capsaicin to the Nasal Mucosa in Man,” researchers found that if we cut a hot pepper and rub it inside our nostrils, our nose will start running, hurting, and we’ll start sneezing (capsaicin is the burning component of hot peppers). Why would anyone do this experiment? Anyone who’s handled hot peppers knows if it gets up your nose it causes an intense burning sensation. However, the researchers noted, “this phenomenon has not been formally investigated.” So they decided it “appeared worthwhile to study the effects produced by the topical application of capsaicin in the human [nose].” It appeared worthwhile because… it had never been done before. So they took some medical students, dripped some in their nose and the poor students started sneezing, burning, and snotting — describing the pain at about eight or nine on a scale of one to ten. No surprise, but here’s the interesting part: What happened when they repeated the experiment the next day? You’d think they might be sensitized to it, still all irritated, so it might hurt even worse, but no–it hurt less. Then they did it again the next day and the next. By day five it hardly hurt at all, they didn’t even get a runny nose. Day ten, and still nothing. Were they permanently numbed? No. After a month or so the desensitization wore off and they were back in agony whenever they tried rubbing it in their nose. What the researchers think is happening is that the pain fibers, the nerves that carry pain sensation, dumped so much of the pain neurotransmitter (called substance P) that they ran out. Day after day of this, the nerves had exhausted their stores and could no longer transmit pain messages until they made more from scratch, which took a couple weeks. This gave researchers an idea. There’s a rare headache syndrome called cluster headache. It has been described as one of the worst pains humans experience. Few, if any, medical disorders are more painful. It’s nicknamed the “suicide headache” because patients often consider taking or have taken their lives over it. It’s thought to be caused by arterial dilation putting pressure on the trigeminal nerve in the face. Treatments involve everything from nerve blocks to Botox to surgery. But that same nerve goes down to the nose. What if we cause the whole nerve to dump all its substance P? Same as before, daily capsaicin was applied in the nose and by day five, they could hardly feel it any more. As seen in my video, Hot Sauce in the Nose for Cluster Headaches?, what the wimpy medical students rated as an eight or nine on the pain scale, those used to the violence of the cluster headache attacks rated a three or four. So, after having achieved desensitization, what happened to their headaches? Cluster headaches are one-sided headaches; there’s only pain on one side of the head. Those who rubbed capsaicin in the nostril on the opposite side of the head had nothing happen. They started out having around 40 attacks a day, and a month later the headaches were still going strong. Those that rubbed capsaicin in the nostril on the side of the head where the headaches were, cut the average number of attacks in half, and in fact half the patients were cured–the cluster headaches were gone completely. All in all, 80% responded, which is at least equal to if not better than all the current therapies out there. This extraordinary effect reminds me of the findings in Lavender for Migraine Headaches. Headache sufferers may additionally want to experiment with avoiding potential triggers such as aspartame (see my video Diet Soda and Preterm Birth). Saffron may also help with headaches (Saffron for the Treatment of PMS), and so might avoiding certain parasites (Pork Tapeworms on the Brain and Avoiding Epilepsy Through Diet). A note of caution, though: Pregnant migraine sufferers seeking natural remedies should be wary of advice they may get (Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees). Those eating healthy diets are less likely to be on pain medications in general (Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants). See, for example: Might the consumption of hot peppers also successfully desensitize the gut?

A-292	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/03/foods-with-natural-melatonin/	Foods with Natural Melatonin	We know that inadequate sleeping is associated with changes in diet—people tend to eat worse—but what about the opposite question: Can food affect sleep? In a study on kiwifruit, this seemed possible (see Kiwifruit For Insomnia), but the mechanism the researchers suggested for the effect—the serotonin levels in kiwifruit—doesn’t make any sense, since serotonin can’t cross the blood-brain barrier. We can eat all the serotonin we want and it shouldn’t affect our brain chemistry. A different brain chemical, though, melatonin, can get from our gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone secreted at night by the pineal gland in the center of our brain to help regulate our circadian rhythm. Supplements of the stuff are used to prevent and reduce jet lag, and about 20 years ago MIT got the patent to use melatonin to help people sleep. But melatonin “is not only produced in the pineal gland—it is also naturally present in edible plants.” That might explain the results of a study, “Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia” (See Tart Cherries for Insomnia). The research group had been doing an earlier study on tart cherry juice as a sports recovery drink. There’s a phytonutrient in cherries with anti-inflammatory effects on par with drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen, so the researchers were trying to see whether tart cherry juice could reduce muscle soreness after exercise. During the study, some of the participants anecdotally noted that they were sleeping better on the cherries. That was unexpected, but the researchers realized that cherries were a source of melatonin so they put them to the test. The reason they chose older subjects is that melatonin production tends to drop as we age, which may be one reason why there’s a higher insomnia rates among the elderly. So, they took a group of older men and women suffering from chronic insomnia and put half on cherries and half on placebo. They couldn’t use whole cherries for the study—how could you fool people with a placebo cherry? So they used cherry juice versus cherry Kool-Aid. They found that participants did in fact sleep a little better on the cherry juice. The effect was modest, but significant. Some, for example, fell to sleep a few minutes faster and had 17 fewer minutes of waking after sleep onset (waking up in the middle of the night). It was no insomnia cure, but it helped—without side effects. How do we know it was the melatonin, though? They repeated the study, this time measuring the melatonin levels, and indeed saw a boost in circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice, but not after the Kool-Aid. Similar results were found in people eating the actual cherries—seven different varieties boosted melatonin levels and actual sleep times. The effects of all the other phytonutrients in cherries can’t be precluded—maybe they helped too—but if it is the melatonin, there are more potent sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers have a lot, as do walnuts—and a tablespoon of flaxseeds has about as much as a tomato. See the chart in my video Tart Cherries for Insomnia. The melatonin content of tomatoes was suggested as one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean diets were so healthy. They have less melatonin than the tart cherries, but people may eat a lot more tomatoes than cherries. Sweet cherries have 50 times less melatonin than tart ones; dried cherries appear to have none. A few spices are pretty potent: just a teaspoon of fenugreek or mustard seeds has as much as a few tomatoes.  The bronze and silver go to almonds and raspberries, though. And the gold goes to gojis. Goji berries were just off the charts. Aren’t goji berries really expensive, though? Not if you buy them as lycium berries. Check out my video Are Goji Berries Good for You? I’ve previously explored Human Neurotransmitters in Plants in the context of boosting serotonin levels in the brain to improve mood. See: Melatonin may also play a role in cancer prevention.

A-293	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/04/01/two-kiwi-fruits-an-hour-before-bedtime/	Two Kiwifruit an Hour before Bedtime	The number one question in sleep research is “Why do we sleep?” followed by the question,“How much sleep do we need?” After literally hundreds of studies, we still don’t know the best answer to either question. A few years ago, I featured a large, 100,000-person study which suggested that both short and long sleep duration were associated with increased mortality, with people getting around seven hours of sleep living longest (See Optimal Sleep Duration). Since then, a meta-analysis that included over a million people was published, and found the same thing. We still don’t know, however, whether “sleep duration is a cause or simply a marker of ill health.” Maybe sleeping too little or too long does make us unhealthy—or maybe we see the associated shortened lifespan because being unhealthy causes us to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published on cognitive function. After controlling for a long list of factors, men and women in their 50s and 60s getting seven or eight hours appeared to have the best short-term memory compared to those that got much more or much less. The same thing was just demonstrated with immune function where “both reduced and prolonged habitual sleep durations were associated with an increased risk of pneumonia.” It’s easy to not get too much sleep—just set an alarm. But what if we’re having problems getting enough? What if we’re one of the one in three adults that suffer symptoms of insomnia? There are sleeping pills like Valium that we can take in the short term, but they have a number of adverse side effects. Non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy are often difficult, time-consuming, and not always effective. Wouldn’t it be great to have “natural treatments that can improve both sleep onset and help patients improve the quality of sleep while improving next-day symptoms over the long term?” What about a study on kiwifruit, featured in my video, Kiwifruit for Insomnia? Participants were given two kiwifruit an hour before bed every night for four weeks. Why kiwifruits? Well, people with sleep disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress, so maybe antioxidant rich foods might help? But all fruits and vegetables have antioxidants. Kiwifruits contain twice the serotonin of tomatoes—but it shouldn’t cross the blood-brain barrier. Kiwifruit has folate, and a deficiency might cause insomnia—but there’s a lot more folate in some other plant foods. The reason they studied kiwifruits is because they got grant money from a kiwifruit company. And I’m glad they did because they found some really remarkable results: significantly improved sleep onset, duration, and efficiency using both subjective and objective measurements.

A-294	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/27/can-we-fight-the-blues-with-greens/	Can We Fight the Blues with Greens?	Why does frequent consumption of vegetables appear to cut one’s odds of depression by more than half? And “frequent” was defined as eating vegetables not 3 or more times a day, but just 3 or more times a week. A 2012 study was found that eliminating animal products improved mood within two weeks. The researchers blamed arachidonic acid, found primarily in chicken and eggs, which might adversely impact mental health via a cascade of brain inflammation. More on this inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid in: But better moods on plant-based diets could also be from the good stuff in plants—a class of phytonutrients that cross the blood brain barrier into our heads. A recent review in the journal, Nutritional Neuroscience, suggests that eating lots of fruits and vegetables “may present a noninvasive natural and inexpensive therapeutic means to support a healthy brain.” But how? To understand the latest research, we need to understand the underlying biology of depression—the so-called monoamine theory of depression. It’s the idea that depression may arise out of a chemical imbalance in the brain. In my video Fighting the Blues with Greens? I run through an oversimplified version. One of the ways the billions of nerves in our brain communicate with one another is through chemical signals called neurotransmitters. Two nerve cells don’t actually touch—there’s a physical gap between them. To bridge that gap, when one nerve wants to tap the other on the shoulder it releases chemicals into that gap, including three monoamines: serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters then float over to the other nerve to get its attention. The first nerve then sucks them back in to be reused the next time it wants to talk. It’s also constantly manufacturing more monoamines, and an enzyme, monoamine oxidase, is constantly chewing them up to maintain just the right amount. The way cocaine works is by acting as a monoamine re-uptake inhibitor. It blocks the first nerve from sucking back up these three chemicals and so there’s a constant tapping on the shoulder—constant signaling—to the next cell. Amphetamines work in the same way but also increase the release of monoamines. Ecstasy works like speed, but just causes comparatively more serotonin release. After awhile, the next nerve may say “enough already!” and down-regulate its receptors to turn down the volume. It puts in earplugs. So we need more and more of the drug to get the same effect, and then when we’re not on the drug we may feel crappy because normal volume transmission just isn’t getting through. Antidepressants are thought to work along similar mechanisms. People who are depressed appear to have elevated levels of monoamine oxidase in their brain. That’s the enzyme that breaks down those neurotransmitters. In the video mentioned previously, I show the levels of monoamine oxidase in the brains of depressed individuals versus healthy individuals. If the levels of our neurotransmitter-eating enzyme is elevated, then our levels of neurotransmitters drops, and we become depressed (or so the theory goes). So a number of different classes of drugs have been developed. The tricyclic antidepressants, named because they have three rings like a tricycle, appear to block norepinephrine and dopamine re-uptake, and so even though our enzymes may be eating these up at an accelerated rate, what gets released sticks around longer. Then there were the SSRIs (the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) like Prozac. Now we know what that means—they just block the re-uptake of serotonin. Then there are drugs that just block the re-uptake of norepinephrine, or block dopamine re-uptake, or a combination. But if the problem is too high levels of monoamine oxidase, why not just block the enzyme? Make a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. They did, but monoamine oxidase inhibitors are considered drugs of last resort because of serious side effects—not the least of which is the dreaded “cheese effect,” where eating certain foods while on the drug can have potentially fatal consequences. If only there was a way to dampen the activity of this enzyme without the whole bleed-into-our-brain-and-die thing. Now we can finally talk about the latest theory as to why fruits and vegetables may improve our mood. There are inhibitors of the depression-associated enzyme in various plants. There are phytonutrients in spices, such as clove, oregano, cinnamon, and nutmeg, that inhibit monoamine oxidase, but people don’t eat enough spices to get enough into the brain. A certain dark green leafy has a lot, but its name is tobacco, which may actually be one of the reasons cigarettes make smokers feel so good. OK, but what if we don’t want brain bleeds or lung cancer? Well, there is a phytonutrient found in apples, berries, grapes, kale, onions, and green tea that may indeed affect our brain biology enough to improve our mood, which may help explain why those eating plant-based diets tend to have superior mental health.

A-295	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/25/starving-tumors-of-their-blood-supply/	Starving Tumors of their Blood Supply	About a third of common cancers may be prevented by eating a healthy, plant-based diet; being physically active; and maintaining a healthy weight. One of the ways plants may help is by cutting off the supply lines to cancerous tumors. A tumor cannot grow without a blood supply. Currently, it is believed that a tumor mass cannot exist in a volume greater than about the size of the ball at the tip of a ballpoint pen without a proper blood supply. This indicates that angiogenesis, the creation of new blood vessels, is critical to tumor growth. Each one of us has cancer cells in us right now. One study describes how “by age 70, microscopic cancers are detected in the thyroid glands of virtually everyone. Most of these tumors never cause problems or become clinically significant, leading to the concept of ‘cancer without disease’ as a normal state during aging.” Cancer cells are commonly present in the body, but they can’t grow into tumors any bigger than that tiny dot size–no more than 10 million cancer cells–before needing to get hooked up to a blood supply. One way cancer turns on the tap is silencing certain tumor suppressor genes. How do we turn them back on? See, for example, Apple Skin: Peeling Back Cancer. Another way tumors commandeer a blood supply is by diabolically releasing angiogenic factors, chemicals that cause new blood vessels to sprout into the tumor. The most important one is called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). But we may be able to suppress VEGF with veggies. Many of the phytonutrients we know and love in tea, spices, fruit, berries, broccoli, and beans can block cancer’s stimulation of new blood vessels. They’re ideal for prophylactic long-term use against breast cancer because of their reliability, availability, safety, and affordable price. A recent review concluded that we now have “convincing evidence that dietary plant constituents possess the unique ability to affect tumor angiogenesis, which may be deemed advantageous in the prevention and treatment of human breast cancer and other tumors.” Most of these studies have only been done in a petri dish, though. Researchers stimulate human blood vessel cells and they start forming tubular structures trying to make new capillaries to feed the tumor. This tube formation can be substantially blocked by adding add plant compounds such as apigen or luteolin, found throughout the plant kingdom in foods such as citrus, celery, and peppers. In a study outlined in my video, Anti-Angiogensis: Cutting Off Tumor Supply Lines, you can see the effect of fisitin, a phytonutrient found in strawberries, shrinking the beginnings of new blood vessel formation. How else can strawberries smack on the cancer kibosh? See Strawberries versus Esophageal Cancer and Cancer Fighting Berries. Where do researchers get their hands on human blood vessels? They get them from discarded umbilical cords or, more controversially, from the eyes of aborted fetuses. Either way, we can stimulate blood vessel formation with the tumor compound VEGF and then abolish that effect with plant compounds. Therefore, “the daily consumption of natural foods containing adequate flavonoids could be beneficial for the prevention of cancer metastasis or could improve cancer prognosis.” Given the power of plants, one might speculate that the foundation of an anti-angiogenic approach to cancer might be a whole food vegan diet. Because we all likely have cancer cells inside us, Cancer Prevention and Treatment May Be the Same Thing. To die with cancer rather than from cancer, we need to slow down cancer doubling time. Check out one of my oldie-but-goodie video Slowing the Growth of Cancer. The cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1 is another angiogenic factor, helping tumors turn on the gravy train. This may be another reason plant-based diets protect against cancer, since as few as two weeks on a healthy diet can lower IGF-1 levels.

A-296	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/20/breast-cancer-and-wine/	Breast Cancer & Wine	After diagnosis, women with breast cancer may cut their risk of dying nearly in half by just instituting simple, modest lifestyle changes—5 or more servings of fruits and veggies a day and walking 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week. But what about preventing breast cancer in the first place? If we follow the advice of the official dietary guidelines for cancer prevention, does it actually reduce our risk of cancer? If we manage our weight, eat more plant foods, less animal foods, less alcohol and breastfeed, based on the largest prospective study on diet and cancer in history, we may significantly lower our risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, oral cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, and all cancers combined. Of all the recommendations, the “eat mostly foods of plant origin” appeared the most powerful. For example, a study in the UK found that in just one year in Britain there were 14,902 excess cases of cancer caused by something participants were exposed to 10 years earlier. What was that something that ended up causing thousands of cancers?   Deficient intake of fruit and vegetables. If that was instead, some chemical spill causing 14,000 cancers, people would be up in arms to ban it—but instead when that killer carcinogen is not eating their “fruit and veg” (as the Brits would say), it hardly gets anyone’s attention. What if we throw in smoking, too? Researchers created a healthy lifestyle index, defined by four things: 1) exercise;  2) a dietary shift away from the standard American diet high in meat, dairy, fat, and sugar towards a more prudent dietary pattern—for instance more green and yellow vegetables, beans, and fruits;  3) avoidance of tobacco; and 4) avoidance of alcohol. Young women scoring higher on those four things cut their odds of getting breast cancer in half, older women cut their odds of breast cancer by 80%! We’ve covered how even light drinking can increase breast cancer risk (see my video Breast Cancer and Alcohol: How Much is Safe?), but for women who refuse to eliminate alcohol, which is less carcinogenic: red wine or white? Some studies, outlined in my four minute video, Breast Cancer Risk: Red Wine vs. White Wine, actually suggest less or even no risk from red wine, and we may have just figured out why. Remember how mushrooms were the vegetable best able to suppress the activity of aromatase, the enzyme used by breast tumors to produce its own estrogen? (from my video Vegetables Versus Breast Cancer). Well, if we run the same human placenta experiments with fruit, strawberries get the silver, but grapes get the gold. For more on the aromatase story, see: But what kind of grapes? The wimpy green grapes used to make white wine barely worked compared to those used for making red.  Bottom line: “red wine may serve as a nutritional aromatase inhibitor, which may ameliorate the elevated breast cancer risk associated with alcohol intake.” But why accept any elevated risk? Just eat whole grapes! And if you do, choose ones with seeds if you can, as they may work even better. More on grapes in Fat Burning Via Flavonoids and Best Fruit Juice. Wasn’t there a study that found that fruits and vegetables weren’t protective against cancer, though? See my video on the EPIC Study. What if you already have breast cancer?

A-297	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/18/why-do-vegan-women-have-fewer-female-cancers/	Why Do Vegan Women Have Fewer Female Cancers?	Cervical cancer is now considered a sexually transmitted disease. It was originally suspected as such, but now we have DNA fingerprinting proof that virtually all cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, human papilloma virus, which also causes cancers of the penis, vagina, vulva and throat. HPV is considered a necessary, but not sufficient cause of cancer. I profile a study in my four minute video, Why Might Vegetarians Have Less HPV?, that shows that while most young women contract HPV,  most don’t get cervical cancer because their immune systems are able to clear out the virus. Within one year, 70 percent of women clear the infection, and more than 90 percent clear it within two years — before the virus can cause cancer. Might those with particularly strong immune systems clear the virus even faster? That’s what may be behind a new study that found vegetarian women had significantly lower infection rates with HPV, one of many studies reporting lower risk of HPV infection among those eating plant-based diets. When researchers took a bunch of women with cancer-causing strains of HPV infecting their cervix and followed them out and retested at three months and nine months while analyzing their diets, what did they find? Higher levels of vegetable consumption appeared to cut their risk of HPV persistence in half, doubling one’s likelihood of clearing this potentially cancer-causing infection. And “higher” levels just meant about two or more servings a day. Antioxidants appear to suppress the activation of critical segments of the virus’ DNA. Maybe that’s why smearing green tea on genital warts—also caused by HPV—has been found so effective in clearing them (See my video, Treating Genital Warts with Green Tea). In terms of preventing cervical cancer, phytonutrients like lutein (found in dark green leafy vegetables) and lycopene (the red pigment in tomatoes) may decrease viral load, thereby decreasing persistence and progression to disease. Bottom line: higher consumption of vegetables may decrease the risk of HPV persistence, which may help explain why a 2013 study found vegan women have significantly lower rates of all female cancers combined, including cancer of the cervix. Vegetarians also have lower rates (see Vegetarians Versus Healthy Omnivores), but the Adventist Health Study 2 is the first study of cancer rates among thousands of North American vegans. There are other reasons that help explain these results, from lower levels of the cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1 (The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle), the foreign meat molecule Neu5Gc (How Tumors Use Meat to Grow: Xeno-Autoantibodies), and heterocyclines in cooked meat (Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens) to more of the good stuff (#1 Anticancer Vegetable and Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better?). Other viruses may actually be found in the food. See, for example: More on improving immune function with improved nutrition can be found in Boosting Immunity While Reducing Inflammation and Boosting Immunity Through Diet. 	-	Adventist Health Studies,cancer,cervical cancer,cervix health,chicken,fruit,genital health,Green tea,growth promoters,hepatitis,hepatitis E,heterocyclic amines,human papilloma virus,IGF-1,immune function,inflammation,lutein,lycopene,lymphoma,meat,Neu5Gc,obesity,oxidative stress,penis cancer,penis health,pets,phytonutrients,plant-based diets,pork,poultry,sexual health,sexual transmission,throat cancer,throat health,turkey,vaginal cancer,vaginal health,vegans,vegetables,vegetarians,vulva cancer	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow-xeno-autoantibodies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetarians-versus-healthy-omnivores/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-might-vegetarians-have-less-hpv/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow-xeno-autoantibodies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetarians-versus-healthy-omnivores/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22357204,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23169929,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-might-vegetarians-have-less-hpv/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12223432	
A-298	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/13/when-a-scraped-knee-may-kill-again/	When a Scraped Knee May Once Again Kill	In a keynote address last year, the Director-General of the World Health Organization warned that we may be facing a future in which many of our miracle drugs no longer work. “A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it,” she said. “Things as common as strep throat or a child’s scratched knee could once again kill.” The Director-General’s prescription to avoid this catastrophe included a global call to “Restrict the use of antibiotics in food production to therapeutic purposes.” In other words, only use antibiotics in agriculture to treat sick animals. In the United States, meat producers feed literally millions of pounds of antibiotics to farm animals who aren’t sick just to promote growth or prevent disease in the often cramped, stressful, unhygienic conditions of industrial animal agriculture. The FDA estimates that 80% of the antimicrobial drugs sold in the U.S. every year now go to the meat industry. The discoverer of penicillin warned us back in the ’40s that misuse could lead to resistance, but the meat industry didn’t listen and started feeding it to chickens by the ton. The Food and Drug Administration finally wised up to the threat in 1977 and proposed stopping the feeding of penicillin and tetracycline to farm animals. That was 37 years ago. Since then, the combined political power of the factory farming and pharmaceutical industries has effectively thwarted any legislative or regulatory action. This stranglehold shows no sign of breaking. We realized this reckless practice was a public health threat decades ago, and yet what’s been done about it? “Present [farm animal] production is concentrated in high-volume, crowded, stressful environments, made possible in part by the routine use of antibacterial [drugs] in [the] feed,” the U.S. Congressional Office of Technology Assessment wrote in 1979. “Thus the current dependency on low-level use of antibiotics to increase or maintain production, while of immediate benefit, also could be the Achilles’ heel of present production methods.” Industrial operations use antibiotics as a crutch to compensate for the squalid conditions that now characterize much of modern agribusiness. The unnatural crowding of animals and their waste creates such a strain on the animals’ immune systems that normal body processes like growth may be impaired. That’s why a constant influx of antibiotics is thought to accelerate weight gain by reducing this infectious load. The problem is that “Each animal feeding on an antibiotic becomes a ‘factory’ for the production and subsequent dispersion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” offering a whole new meaning to the term “factory farm” (see my 3-min video Past the Age of Miracles: Facing a Post-Antibiotic Age for details). What else do they feed farm animals? Check out: This issue, perhaps more than any other, lays to bare the power of moneyed interests to undermine public health. Look at the long list of endorsers of legislation to reform this practice. Sadly, though, the sway of nearly every single medical organization in the United States is no match for the combined might of Big Ag and Big Pharma.

A-299	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/11/why-you-should-eat-more-beans/	Why We Should Eat More Beans	We’ve known for decades that beans have an exceptionally low glycemic index.

So if you’re going to eat some high glycemic food like white rice, consider having some beans with it, and the more beans the better. If you check out my 3-min video Beans and the Second Meal Effect, you can see that as the subjects’ bean to rice ratio increases, cardiometabolic risk factors continually improve. Substituting one serving of beans for one serving of white rice was associated with a 35 percent lower risk of metabolic syndrome (pre-diabetes). Why do beans have such a low glycemic index? Maybe it’s because they’ve got so much fiber that absorption is just slower or something? It was this study that blew everyone’s minds. It started about as expected. Give people bread for breakfast, and they get big spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, but give the same amount of carbs in lentil form and you blunt the effect. (Lentils for breakfast? Well, the Brits like baked beans on their toast, but I’ve started using a handful of sprouted lentils in my breakfast smoothie. See A Better Breakfast and Antioxidants Sprouting Up). What they did different, though, was follow through to lunch. For lunch both groups got the same meal; they both got bread. Those that had lentils for breakfast, though, had less of a glycemic reaction to the bread. At the time they called it the “lentil effect,” but subsequent studies found chickpeas appear to work just as well. It has since been dubbed the “second meal effect.” Eat lentils for dinner, and then for breakfast, even if forced to drink sugar water, we have better glycemic control. Beans moderate your blood sugar not just at the meal we eat them, but even hours later or the next day. How is that even possible? The mystery has since been solved. Remember what our gazillions of gut bacteria do with fiber? They produce compounds like propionate with it (see Fawning Over Flora and Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics) that get absorbed into our system and slow down gastric emptying—the rate at which food leaves our stomach—so we don’t get as much of a sugar rush. It’s like symbiosis. We feed our good bacteria and they feed us back. So, we have a bean burrito for supper and by the next morning it’s time for our gut bacteria to eat that same burrito and the by-products they create may affect how our breakfast is digested. Researchers figured this out by giving people rectal infusions of the amount of propionate your good bacteria might make from a good burrito, and the stomach relaxes within minutes. I guess if you forgot to eat any kind of beans for supper and need to blunt the effect of your breakfast doughnut, it’s theoretically not too late—but in general I encourage people to administer their food orally. What about the gas? Check out my blog post Beans and Gas: Clearing the Air. Which beans are most antioxidant packed? See The Best Bean and The Healthiest Lentil (hint: skip the jelly variety). Which lower cholesterol the most? See Soy Worth a Hill of Beans? What other superpowers do beans posses? They are packed with potassium (Preventing Strokes with Diet), mad with magnesium (Mineral of the Year—Magnesium), and a preferred source of protein (Plant Protein Preferable). They improve breast cancer survival (Breast Cancer Survival and Soy), reduce hot flashes (Soy Foods & Menopause), delay premature puberty (The Effect of Soy on Precocious Puberty), and they’re a great bargain to boot (Eating Healthy on a Budget). 	-	beans,blood sugar,bread,carbohydrates,chickpeas,diabetes,fiber,garbanzo beans,gastric emptying,glycemic index,gut bacteria,gut flora,insulin,lentil effect,lentils,metabolic syndrome,pasta,peas,potatoes,pre-diabetes,propionate,rice,second meal effect,sugar	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/05/beans-and-gas-clearing-the-air/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-sprouting-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-lentil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-bean-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raisins-vs-jelly-beans-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fawning-over-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-foods-menopause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-good-bacteria-in-the-colon-without-probiotics/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-sprouting-up/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1713902/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-lentil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-strokes-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-bean-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raisins-vs-jelly-beans-for-athletic-performance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21813808,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fawning-over-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/05/beans-and-gas-clearing-the-air/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-foods-menopause/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-healthy-on-a-budget,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-good-bacteria-in-the-colon-without-probiotics/	
A-300	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/06/egg-industry-caught-making-false-claims/	Egg Industry Caught Making False Claims	On the basis of concerns from the American Heart Association and consumer groups, the Federal Trade Commission carried out successful legal action—upheld by the Supreme Court—to compel the egg industry to cease and desist from false and misleading advertising that eggs had no harmful effects on health. Over the years, cholesterol concerns resulted in severe economic loss through a reduction in egg consumption, so the egg industry created a “National Commission on Egg Nutrition” to combat the public health warnings with ads that said things like “There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that eating eggs in any way increases the risk of heart attack.” The U.S. Court of Appeals found such outright deception patently false and misleading. Even the tobacco industry wasn’t that brazen, trying only to introduce the element of doubt, arguing that the relationship between smoking and health remains an open question. In contrast, the egg ads made seven claims, each of which was determined by the courts to be blatantly false. The Court determined the egg industry ads were “false, misleading, and deceptive.” Legal scholars note that, like Big Tobacco, the egg industry did more than just espouse one side of a genuine controversy, but flatly denied the existence of scientific evidence. Over the last 36 years, the American Egg Board has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to convince people eggs are not going to kill them—and it’s working. From one of their internal strategy documents that I was able to get a hold of: “In combination with aggressive nutrition science and public relations efforts, research shows that the advertising has been effective in decreasing consumers concerns over eggs and cholesterol/heart health.” Currently, they’re targeting moms. Their approach is to “surround moms wherever they are.” They pay integration fees for egg product placement in TV shows. To integrate eggs into The Biggest Loser, for example, could be a million dollars, according to their internal documents. Getting some kids storytime reading program to integrate eggs may only take half a million, though. The American Egg Board keeps track of who is, and is not, a “friend-of-eggs.” They even pay scientists $1500 to sit and answer questions like, “What studies can help disassociate eggs from cardiovascular disease?” From the beginning, their arch nemesis was the American Heart Association, with whom they fought a major battle over cholesterol. In documents retrieved through the Freedom of Information Act featured in my 6-min video Eggs and Cholesterol: Patently False and Misleading Claims, you can see even the USDA repeatedly chastises the egg industry for misrepresenting the American Heart Association position. In a draft letter to magazine editors, the egg industry tried to say that the “American Heart Association changed its recommendations to approve an egg a day in 2000 and eventually eliminated its number restrictions on eggs in 2002,” to which the head of USDA’s poultry research and promotion programs had to explain that the “change” in 2000 wasn’t a change at all. Nothing in the guidelines or recommendations was changed. What happened was that in response to a question posed by someone planted in the audience, Heart Association reps acknowledged that even though eggs are among the most concentrated source of cholesterol in the diet, an individual egg has under 300mg of cholesterol and could technically fit under the 300 mg daily limit. In 2002, they eliminated the specific mention of eggs for consistency sake, but the American Heart Association insists that they haven’t changed their position and continue to warn consumers about eggs. The guidelines on the AHA website at the time explained that since one egg has 213 and the limit for people with normal cholesterol is 300 you could fit an egg in if you cut down on all other animal products. If you have an egg for breakfast, for example, and some coffee, some skinless turkey breast for lunch, etc., you could end up at over 500 by the end of the day, nearly twice the recommended limit. So if you are going to eat an egg, the Heart Association instructed, we would need to “substitute vegetables for some of the meat, drink our coffee black, and watch for hidden eggs in baked goods.” Furthermore, the limit for folks with high cholesterol is 200mg a day, which may not even allow a single egg a day. This is how the senior director of nutrition education at the American Egg Board’s Egg Nutrition Center characterized the American Heart Association guidelines: “Maybe I’m being overly sensitive, but this reads like: ‘If you insist on having those deadly high cholesterol eggs your penalty will be to eat vegetables and you can’t even have the yummy steak and creamy coffee you love. Really it’s not worth eating eggs. Oh, and if you think you’ll be able to enjoy some delicious baked goods, forget it, the deadly eggs are there too!’” I shared some of my other Freedom of Information Act finds in my other egg videos, Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis, and my personal favorite, Who Says Eggs Aren’t Healthy or Safe? I’ve also explored the presence of carcinogenic chemicals in eggs (Heterocyclic Amines in Eggs, Cheese, and Creatine?), carcinogenic viruses (Carcinogenic Retrovirus Found in Eggs), industrial pollutants (Food Sources of Perfluorochemicals and Food Sources of PCB Chemical Pollutants), the egg-borne annual epidemic of Salmonella (Total Recall), arachidonic acid (Chicken, Eggs, and Inflammation), misleading claims about eyesight nutrients (Egg Industry Blind Spot), and, of course, cholesterol (Egg Cholesterol in the Diet and What Women Should Eat to Live Longer). To my surprise, though, eggs are actually not the most concentrated dietary source of cholesterol.

A-301	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/04/male-fertility-and-dietary-pollutants/	Male Fertility & Dietary Pollutants	Infertility affects 10–15 percent of couples attempting to conceive, and in about half the cases the problem is in the man. A recent Harvard study found that increasing saturated fat intake just 5 percent was associated with a 38 percent lower sperm count, but why? It may be because of endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants that build up in animal fat, particularly fish, as I describe in my video Xenoestrogens & Sperm Counts, but male fertility is not just about the number of sperm, but also how well they work. A recent study, featured in my 5-min video Male Fertility and Diet, found that successful pregnancy and fertilized egg implantation outcomes are decreased in patients reporting a more frequent intake of meat. The researchers blame industrial pollutants and steroids present in animal products. They conclude that couples having trouble conceiving must be advised about the dramatic effects diet may play on treatment success for both men and women, consistent with previous findings that “frequent intake of fat-laden foods like meat products or milk may negatively affect semen quality in humans, whereas some fruits or vegetables may maintain or improve semen quality.” Vegetable consumption was also found protective in this new study, which may be because of the antioxidant and nutrient content. The reason why maternal beef consumption may alter a man’s testicular development and adversely affect his future reproductive capacity is thought to be due to the anabolic steroids implanted into the animals. However, as an accompanying editorial to a study exploring this phenomenon pointed out, the steroids could also be interacting with other xenobiotics—industrial chemicals present in meat—such as pesticides and dioxin-like pollutants, and even chemicals that may be present in the plastic wrap (see Dioxins in the Food Supply). For more on the hormones used in meat production, see my video Anabolic Steroids in Meat. Heavy metals may also play a role. Lead and cadmium exposure, as measured by levels in the bloodstream, were associated with a significantly longer time to conceive. Where might exposure be coming from? Common types of seafood from fish markets and supermarkets were sampled. The highest cadmium levels were found in tuna; highest lead levels in scallops and shrimp. The greatest risk from different metals resided in different fish. Thus, the risk information given to the public (mainly about mercury) does not present a complete picture. There are other toxic metals in fish as well. For more on heavy metal exposure (dietary as opposed to auditory), see: The only beverage associated with infertility in women was soft drinks, though this may be from an indirect route, since soda is linked to obesity and obesity is then linked to reduced fertilization rates. However, Harvard researchers conducted a study on one really direct route: “The Effectiveness of Coca Cola As a Spermicidal Agent in Vaginal Douching.” Diet coke apparently had the strongest effect. What about Coke versus Pepsi? Tax-payer money hard at work for this head-to-head test. Neither of them really worked—Coke nor Pepsi—though they explain their methods for preparing the “sperm-cola mixtures” differed from the Harvard group. Bottom line: soda probably isn’t good for you going into any orifice.

A-302	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/27/trans-fat-in-animal-fat/	Trans Fat in Animal Fat	Trans fats are bad. They may increase one’s risks of heart disease, sudden death, diabetes—and perhaps even aggression. Trans fat intake has been associated with overt aggressive behavior, impatience, and irritability. Trans fats are basically found in only one place in nature: animal fat. The food industry, however, found a way to synthetically create these toxic fats by hardening vegetable oil in a process called hydrogenation, which rearranges their atoms to make them behave more like animal fats. Although most of America’s trans fat intake has traditionally come from processed foods containing partially-hydrogenated oils, a fifth of the trans fats in the American diet used to come from animal products—1.2 grams out of the 5.8 total consumed daily. Now that trans fat labeling has been mandated, however, and places like New York City have banned the use of partially hydrogenated oils, the intake of industrial-produced trans fat is down to about 1.3, so about 50 percent of America’s trans fats come now from animal products. Which foods naturally have significant amounts of trans fat? According to the official USDA nutrient database, cheese, milk, yogurt, burgers, chicken fat, turkey meat, bologna, and hot dogs contain about 1 to 5 percent trans fats (see the USDA chart in Trans Fat In Meat And Dairy). There are also tiny amounts of trans fats in non-hydrogenated vegetable oils due to steam deodorization or stripping during the refining process. Is getting a few percent trans fats a problem, though? The most prestigious scientific body in the United States, the National Academies of Science (NAS), concluded that the only safe intake of trans fats is zero. In their report condemning trans fats, they couldn’t even assign a Tolerable Upper Daily Limit of intake because “any incremental increase in trans fatty acid intake increases coronary heart disease risk.” There may also be no safe intake of dietary cholesterol, which underscores the importance of reducing animal product consumption. See my video Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. There’s been controversy, though, as to whether the trans fats naturally found in animal products are as bad as the synthetic fats in partially hydrogenated junk food. The latest study supports the notion that trans fat intake, irrespective of source—animal or industrial—increases cardiovascular disease risk, especially, it appears, in women. “Because trans fats are unavoidable on ordinary, non-vegan diets, getting down to zero percent trans fats would require significant changes in patterns of dietary intake,” reads the NAS report. One of the authors, the Director of Harvard’s Cardiovascular Epidemiology Program, famously explained why—despite this—they didn’t recommend a vegan diet: “We can’t tell people to stop eating all meat and all dairy products,” he said. “Well, we could tell people to become vegetarians,” he added. “If we were truly basing this only on science, we would, but it is a bit extreme.”   Wouldn’t want scientists basing anything on science now would we? “Nevertheless,” the report concludes, “it is recommended that trans fatty acid consumption be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet.” Even if you eat vegan, though, there’s a loophole in labeling regulations that allows foods with a trans fats content of less than 0.5 grams per serving to be listed as having—you guessed it—zero grams of trans fat. This labeling is misguiding the public by allowing foods to be labeled as ”trans fat free” when they are, in fact, not. So to avoid all trans fats, avoid meat and dairy, refined oils, and anything that says partially hydrogenated in the ingredients list, regardless of what it says on the Nutrition Facts label. More on trans fat can be found in my videos Blocking the First Step of Heart Disease and Breast Cancer Survival and Trans Fat. While unrefined oils such as extra virgin olive should not contain trans fats, to boost the absorption of carotenoids in your salad why not add olives themselves or whole food sources of fat such as nuts or seeds?

A-303	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/25/ginger-lemon-balm-for-radiation-exposure/	Ginger & Lemon Balm for Radiation Exposure	The German Medical Association has finally apologized for the profession’s role in the Nazi atrocities, 65 years after 20 physicians stood trial in Nuremberg. During the trial, the Nazi doctors argued that their experiments were not unlike previous studies by researchers in the United States, such as Dr. Strong’s injection of prisoners with the plague. Nazi Docs were hanged; Dr. Strong went on to Harvard. We were just getting started. The few examples the Nazis cited were nothing compared to what the American medical establishment started doing after Nuremburg. After all, researchers noted, prisoners are cheaper than chimpanzees. Much attention has focused on our cold war radiation experiments, which remained classified for decades. Declassification, the American Energy Commission warned, would have a “very poor effect on the public” because they were performed on human subjects. Subjects like Mr. Cade, a 53 “colored male” who got in a car accident and ended up in the hospital, where was was injected with plutonium. Who is even more powerless than patients? At the Fernald School in Waltham, Massachusetts children with developmental disabilities were fed radioactive isotopes in their breakfast cereal. Despite the Pentagon’s insistence that these were the “only feasible means” of developing ways to protect people from radiation, researchers have since come up with a few ways that don’t violate the Nuremburg code, which states that doctors are only allowed to do experiments that may kill or disable people if they themselves are willing to sign up as experimental subjects. For those interested in the Nuremburg narrative, I touch on other cases of medical mistreatment in: One way is to study cells in a petri dish. For example a study I profile in my video Reducing Radiation Damage With Ginger & Lemon Balm entitled “The Protective Effect of Zingerone Against Radiation-Induced Genetic Damage and Cell Death in Human White Blood Cells.” What is zingerone? It’s a phytonutrient found in cooked ginger root. Researchers blasted cells with gamma rays and found less DNA damage and fewer free radicals when they added ginger phytonutrients. They even compared zingerone to the leading drug injected into people to protect them from radiation sickness, and found the ginger compound to be 150 times more powerful—and without the serious side effects of the drug. The researchers concluded that ginger is an “inexpensive natural product that may protect against radiation-induced damage.” So know that as you’re sucking on some crystallized ginger to prevent travel sickness on an airplane, you may be protecting yourself from the cosmic radiation at that altitude as well. What else can ginger do? See: Lots of different plant-products have been found to be protective in vitro against radiation damage by a variety of mechanisms. After all, plants have been utilized since time immemorial for curing diseases, so researchers started screening plants and  found radiation-protective benefits from other plants one can find at the grocery store such as garlic, turmeric, goji berries, and mint leaves (I now add ginger to my pink juice and hibiscus punch recipes). But this was all just on cells in a test tube. None had actually been tested in actual people—until now. How are you going to find people exposed to radiation whom you can test stuff on? Oe group that suffers inordinate radiation exposure is the hospital workers that run the X-ray machines. They have been found to suffer chromosomal damage and higher levels of oxidative stress on their bodies compared to other hospital staff (although X-rays can damage DNA directly, much of the damage is caused by the free radicals generated by the radiation). So, the researchers asked radiology staff to drink two cups a day of lemon balm tea for a month, an herbal tea known to have high levels of antioxidants (as I showed in one of my favorite videos, Antioxidants in a Pinch). The level of antioxidant enzyme activity in their bloodstream went up and the level of free radical damage went down, leading to the conclusion that oral administration of lemon balm tea may be helpful for the protection of radiology staff against radiation-induced oxidative stress. This is the final installment of a five-part video series on preventing and treating radiation damage. I started with Fukushima and Radioactivity in Seafood on avoiding radiation exposure in one’s diet and then moved to diagnostic medical and dental radiation in Cancer Risk from CT Scan Radiation and Do Dental X-Rays Cause Brain Tumors?. In the last video, Mediating Radiation Exposure from Air Travel, I reviewed population studies of airline pilots and Chernobyl victims that looked at which dietary components may decrease radiation-induced DNA damage and cancer risk. 	-	children,DNA damage,free radicals,garlic,ginger,goji berries,lemon balm,lemon balm tea,mint leaves,Nuremburg,oxidative stress,Pentagon,phytonutrients,radiation,radioactive isotopes,The Cold War,The German Medical Association,The Holocaust,turmeric,X-rays,zingerone	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-hibiscus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-hibiscus/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11644626,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21335001,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858648,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22893146,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-304	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/20/dealing-with-air-travel-radiation-exposure/	Dealing with Air Travel Radiation Exposure	Doctors appear to be causing tens of thousands of cancers with CT scans and dentists may be causing a few brain tumors with dental X-rays (see my two videos Cancer Risk from CT Scan Radiation and Do Dental X-Rays Cause Brain Tumors?), but what about these new-fangled airport full-body scanners that use so-called backscatter technology to reduce X-ray exposure? A thousand times less radiation exposure than a chest X-ray, though they’re still being phased out. In fact, flight passengers may get 100 times more radiation during the flight every hour, because they’re so high up in the atmosphere and exposed to more cosmic rays. Does that mean a round-trip cross-country flight is almost like getting a chest X-ray? Yes. Anyone who’s seen my speaking schedule knows I’m totally screwed. But what can you do? As is the answer to so many health questions, you can eat healthily. High dietary antioxidant intakes are associated with decreased DNA damage in airline pilots. Note the word “dietary.” Antioxidant supplements didn’t work. No benefit was found for those taking multivitamins, vitamin C pills, or vitamin E pills. But those getting the most vitamin C from food, B carotene from food, cryptoxanthin from food, and lutein/zeaxanthin from food, saw a significant decrease in DNA damage. The USDA keeps a nice list of phytonutrient resources. Cryptoxanthin sources listed here (Healthy Pumpkin Pie anyone?). Lutein and zeaxanthin can help us Prevent Glaucoma and See 27 Miles Farther and may present a Dietary Prevention of Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Are these eyesight-saving phytonutrients also found in eggs? You might be surprised. See Egg Industry Blind Spot. For more on why produce is generally preferable to pills, check out: These are all phytonutrients, of course, so when they say food, they really mean plants.  And because antioxidants can have synergistic effects, the greatest protection was found when they were eating a combination of phytonutrients, so the greatest protection was found in those eating the citrus and broccoli and nuts and seeds and pumpkins and peppers and dark green leafy vegetables. Though if one had to pick, greens may be the best. All this time I’ve been packing kale chips on planes as a snack just because they’re so lightweight, but now I know their dual purpose. The researchers conclude that a diet consisting of a variety of fruits and vegetables provides a natural source of these antioxidants as well as other potential protective factors, which may offer the best protection against cumulative DNA damage associated with ionizing radiation exposure. The results are especially relevant to flight crews, astronauts, and frequent flyers. The same thing was found following Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors for decades. Models based on the available data suggest that the cancer risk in exposed persons may have been knocked down by daily green and yellow vegetable consumption from about 50% increased cancer risk to only about 30% increased risk. Similar results were found for fruit consumption. So fruit and vegetable consumption can diminish, but not eliminate the risks of radiation. Same thing was found following children after Chernobyl. I profile a study in my video Mediating Radiation Exposure From Airline Travel in which consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits was found to afford protection to the immune systems of exposed children, whereas egg and fish consumption was associated with significantly increased risk of chromosome damage within their bodies. Researchers were unsure whether the damage attributed to fish and eggs was because the eggs and fish carried radioactivity, or whether it was just from the animal fat intake alone. Why might eggs be harmful even if not radioactive? See Who Says Eggs Aren’t Healthy or Safe? or my other 58 videos on eggs. I cover natural and artificial radioactivity in fish in Fukushima and Radioactivity in Seafood and explore concerns about other pollutants in my 89 fish videos. 	-	air travel,antioxidants,B carotene,cancer,Chernobyl,cosmic rays,cryptoxanthin,dentists,DNA damage,doctors,eggs,fish,fruits,full-body scanners,iatrogenic harm,lutein,nuts,phytonutrients,radiation,seeds,synergistic effects,vegetables,vitamin C,X-rays,zeaxanthin	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-prevention-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/food-composition/individual-macronutrients-phytonutrients-vitamins-minerals/phytonutrients,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12729509,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793852,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225589,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.DrGreger.org/dates.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fish/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/phytochemicals/carotenoids/index.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-prevention-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11572275	
A-305	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/18/are-dental-x-rays-safe/	Are Dental X-Rays Safe?	Every year, doctors cause an estimated 29,000 cancers a year dosing patients with X-rays during CAT scans (see Cancer Risk from CT Scan Radiation). What about dentists? 100 million Americans are exposed to dental X-rays every year, but don’t the lead apron and thyroid shield protect our vital organs? All our vital organs except one, our brain! A study entitled “Dental X-Rays and Risk of Meningioma,” was recently published. The objective was to explore the association between dental X-rays—the most common artificial source of high-energy radiation—and the risk of intracranial meningioma, the most common type of brain tumor. The researchers found that those who report ever having a bitewing X-ray had twice the odds of a brain tumor, and those that got a panoramic series—the full mouth X-rays—before age 10 had nearly 5 times the odds (see my 3-min video Do Dental X-Rays Cause Brain Tumors? for details). While more research is needed, the bottom line is the benefits and risks of radiation exposure must always be carefully weighed. Dentists should consider the justification for every exposure. Furthermore, dentists should not prescribe routine dental X-rays at preset intervals for all patients (such as every 6 months or year, etc.). Says who? Says the official recommendations of the American Dental Association. There is little evidence to support irradiating people looking at all the teeth in search of hidden problems in asymptomatic patients. Accordingly, dentists should select patients wisely—only take X-rays when there is patient-specific reason to believe there is a reasonable expectation the X-rays will offer unique information influencing diagnosis or treatment. The last time I was at at the dentist for my check-up I was again offered a set of full mouth X-rays (because I was “due”). Normally when I refuse routine dental X-rays I’ve just explained that I try to minimize my radiation exposure, but this time I was able to refuse “as per the official recommendation of the American Dental Association!” I just got a blank stare. More on avoiding brain tumors in: This is the third in a five part video series on preventing and mediating the adverse effects of radiation exposure. The first, Fukushima and Radioactivity in Seafood, described the natural and artificial sources of radioactive isotopes in our diet. The previous video, Cancer Risk from CT Scan Radiation detailed the estimated 29,000 cancers that doctors cause with CAT scans every year. I also have videos on Mediating Radiation Exposure from Air Travel, in which I talk about those full-body scanners in airports. And I close out with ways to mediate all these risks with Reducing Radiation Damage With Ginger And Lemon Balm. 	-	American Dental Association,brain tumour,cancer,dental X-rays,dentists,doctors,iatrogenic harm,intracranial meningioma,meningioma,oral health,radiation,X-rays	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16946440,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-radiation-damage-with-ginger-and-lemon-balm/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mediating-radiation-exposure-from-airline-travel/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492363,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-306	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/13/how-risky-are-ct-scans/	How Risky Are CT Scans?	The greatest radiation exposure risk comes not from the Fukushima fallout or the polonium naturally found in all seafood (see my last video, Fukushima and Radioactivity in Seafood), but from doctors. This was the study that originally shook things up: “Estimated Risks of Radiation-Induced Fatal Cancer from Pediatric CAT scans.” Researchers concluded that the best available risk estimates suggest that pediatric CAT scans (also known as CT scans) will result in significantly increased lifetime radiation risk. How increased? In the United States, of the approximately 600,000 abdominal and head CT scans annually performed in children under the age of fifteen, 500 of these individuals might ultimately not just get cancer but die from cancer attributable to the CAT scan radiation. In response to this revelation, the editor-in-chief of the leading radiology journal admitted that radiologists have not been watching out for children. The cancer estimates were based on data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors, in terms of how many deaths one can expect from what kind of radiation dose. However, there’s never been a study able to actually document the excess cancers—until now. It turns out that the X-rays released by CAT scanners may be twice as carcinogenic as the higher energy gamma rays released from atomic bombs. Just a few CT scans may triple the risk of brain tumors and leukemia in children. Other studies are being performed around the world to quantify the risk and should be out in the next few years. Until then, what can we do? First of all, we should get X-rays only when absolutely necessary. Good evidence suggests that between a fifth and a half of CAT scans aren’t necessary at all—they could be replaced with another type of imaging or not performed at all. That’s a lot of added cancer risk for no added benefit. If you check out my 4-min video Cancer Risk From CT Scan Radiation, you can see the risk of developing cancer for different groups after getting one CT scan. The risk of developing cancer after a single CT scan may be as high as 1 in a 100 for a baby girl. It can take years for cancer to develop, though, which is why the risk is lower in the elderly since they have fewer years left to live. The diagnostic medical radiation dealt out in one year is estimated to cause 2,800 breast cancers among women in the United States, and 25,000 other cancers. That’s doctors causing a lot of cancer. One chest CT scan is like getting 400 chest X-rays, and a stress test heart scan can be like getting over a thousand X-rays. Doctors need to communicate the risks of these procedures, using relatable analogies. For example, the risk of a chest CT is like the risk of having a car crash during 2500 miles of highway driving or of smoking 700 cigarettes. You pick up a pack of cigarettes and there’s a warning label, but then you go in for thallium heart scan, and no one minds telling you that the risk corresponds to smoking 1400 cigarettes. One in every 270 middle-aged women that get an angiogram may get cancer because of that one test. The risk associated with the thallium heart scans shocked me. By eating healthy, we may not only eliminate the death and disability associated with heart disease and its treatment (such as open heart surgery), but the risks associated with heart disease diagnosis as well. See these videos for my advice on preventing heart disease: As I explain in my full-length live presentation on preventing, arresting, and reversing the 15 top killers (Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death), adverse drug reactions from prescription drugs are estimated to cause more than 100,000 deaths in the United States every year, making doctors the sixth leading cause of death. And that’s not counting other “iatrogenic” (physician-caused) harm, such as these radiation risks or medication errors or infections acquired in hospitals. My profession needs to do a better job of offering fully informed consent, clearly and comprehensively explaining the risks and benefits of each alternate course of action. What about getting X-rays at the dentist? I’ve got a video about that too: Do Dental X-Rays Cause Brain Tumors?. And cell phone radiation? See my video Do Cell Phones Cause Cancer? 	-	angiograms,brain tumors,breast cancer,cancer,CAT scan,children,CT scan,heart disease,iatrogenic harm,leukemia,pediatrics,prescription drugs,radiation,thallium heart scans,X-ray computer tomography,X-rays	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-cell-phones-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-dental-x-rays-cause-brain-tumors,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-cell-phones-cause-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960815-0/abstract,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11159059,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521582/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-307	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/11/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/	Fukushima Radiation & Seafood	With prevailing westerly winds over Japan, radioactive fallout from the Fukushima nuclear power plant tragedy was detected throughout North America at levels comparable to those seen 25 years earlier from Chernobyl, the only other category 7 nuclear event in history. The highest levels of radioactive iodine in rain water were found in Boise, Idaho, and the highest levels in milk were found in San Francisco at levels ten times higher than the federal maximum allowed in drinking water. This is below that which would be expected to pose a direct threat to U.S. public health, but a controversial paper in the International Journal of Health Sciences suggested the radioactive plume from the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima may be responsible for the subsequent bump in U.S. mortality — similar to what we saw after Chernobyl (see my 4-min video Fukushima and Radioactivity in Seafood for details). However, the authors themselves underscore that their research shows merely a correlation, and potential evidence of a causal link. They stress that more research is necessary. Of all the radiation released, only a tiny fraction of the fallout reached U.S. shores—most was absorbed by the Pacific Ocean. What does that mean for seafood safety? Researchers report unequivocal evidence that Pacific Bluefin tuna have transported Fukushima-derived radioactive fallout across the entire North Pacific Ocean. Tuna migrate from Japan to California and appear to have taken some radioactivity with them. Unfortunately, more than just radiation from nuclear disasters enters our oceans. Our oceans have become humanity’s sewers; everything eventually flows down into the sea. This has implications for other aspects of seafood safety: Even though there was a 10-fold spike in radioactive cesium levels in tuna, the researchers put it in context by noting that there were baseline levels of radioactivity in fish even before Fukushima, due to everything from thermonuclear weapons tests and sunken nuclear submarines to the radioactive elements found naturally in the earth’s crust. The levels in seawater of radioactive polonium (the element used in the horrific assassination of Russian dissident Litvinenko) are miniscule, but it strongly bioaccumulates up the food chain into fish. Polonium is a by-product of uranium decay and is frequently cited as one of the reasons that tobacco is so carcinogenic. That was something the tobacco industry was well aware of and could have easily removed, but the process that could have removed the polonium affected the absorbability of nicotine. The loss of the nicotine “kick” sensation was found unacceptable by industry executives. So they kept the polonium in. Cigarette manufacturers’ protection of stockholders over the public is not unique to that sector. More industry hijinks in: The radioactive polonium in cigarettes has been speculatively blamed for the link between smoking and male infertility, but most of human exposure comes from diet—mainly fish and shellfish. And this was before Fukushima. So what happens if we eat seafood? Researchers measured the increase in radioactive polonium levels in semen after a single seafood meal. It caused a 300 percent spike in radioactivity levels. Probably not enough to cause infertility—but that was just one meal. Whether the kind of dose you can get from eating seafood is high enough to damage sperm cells still needs to be established. Researchers calculate that may have to eat as much as a pound of seafood a month before we might realize the harmful effects of the radiation. More on infertility in: Interestingly, there’s 8 times more polonium in cooked shrimp than in raw. Researchers think it’s because most of the polonium is in the shrimps’ internal organs, which is released in to the boiling water and contaminates the muscle. Gutting crustaceans before cooking may therefore decrease radiation exposure. The greatest radiation exposure risk, however, comes not from Fukushima fallout or the polonium naturally found in seafood, but from doctors. See my video, Cancer Risk from CT Scan Radiation. This was touched on in a recent New York Times op ed. 	-	bioaccumulation,Chernobyl,cigarettes,dairy,dioxins,fish,Fukushima,infertility,male infertility,milk,mortality,nuclear fallout,nuclear power plant,oceans,Pacific Bluefin tuna,Pacific Ocean,pollution,polonium,radioactive fallout,radioactivity,salmon,shrimp,tobacco,tuna,uranium	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-risk-from-ct-scan-radiation/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296469,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22403909,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22645346,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/opinion/we-are-giving-ourselves-cancer.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21956761,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-308	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/06/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/	Tea & Fluoride Risk	If cranberries are so good at keeping bacteria from sticking to the wall of the bladder (see my video Can Cranberry Juice Treat Bladder Infections?), what about keeping bacteria from sticking to other places? There is in vitro research suggesting cranberry phytonutrients may reduce adhesion of H. pylori bacteria in the wall of the stomach, so maybe cranberries should be given along with antibiotics to help eradicate the ulcer-causing bacteria. But hey, what about our teeth? Dental plaque is bacteria sticking to our teeth, particularly Streptococcus mutans. We’ve known that those with different drinking habits—be they coffee, tea, barley coffee, or wine—have about 10 times less of these plaque bacteria. Since those are all beverages from plants, maybe phytonutrients are fighting back at plaque. If bacteria cause plaque and cavities, why not just swish with some antibiotic solution? There are downsides to just indiscriminately wiping out bacteria both good and bad, as I detailed in my Don’t Use Antiseptic Mouthwash video. So maybe it would be better if we just stop the bad bugs from sticking to our teeth. There is some evidence that cranberries might affect the adhesion of bacteria to fake teeth in a petri dish, but nothing yet definitive. Green tea also appears to help prevent cavities, but that may be because of its natural fluoride content in the tea plant. I have a video about a woman who developed fluoride toxicity drinking up to the equivalent of about five dozen cups a day, but what about just regular consumption? During the tooth development years, up to about age 9, children exposed to too much fluoride can develop dental fluorosis, a mottled discoloration of the teeth. It’s just a cosmetic issue and usually just manifests as faint white spots, but it’s the main reason the EPA is reconsidering current tap water fluoridation levels. If you watch my 3-min video Childhood Tea Drinking May Increase Fluorosis Risk, you’ll see that herbal teas are fine–about 100 fold under the limit–but caffeinated teas exceed the suggested limit, and decaf teas exceed the mandatory limit. Those limits are for tap water, though, so tea drinking would only pose much of a risk if drank all day long as one’s primary beverage. Kids who primarily drink non-herbal tea as a source of hydration would be at risk for dental fluorosis. What may be the best source of hydration for kids? Might tea also cause dehydration? Find the answers to these beverage-related questions in my videos Does a Drink of Water Make Children Smarter? and Is Caffeinated Tea Dehydrating? What about all those folks that say fluoride is a poison to be avoided at all costs? I offer my brief two cents in the Q&A The Dangers of Fluoride? There are elements for which there is no safe level of exposure, though. I explore a few in my video Fukushima and Radioactivity in Seafood. Beyond cosmetic issues, what should we eat and drink to keep our mouth healthy?

A-309	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/02/04/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/	Does Cranberry Juice Work Against Bladder Infections?	How could any bacteria cause a bladder infection without just getting flushed away—literally? Bladder infections may make sense if we’re not drinking enough or if we leave behind a stagnant pool because we can’t empty completely (as in men with enlarged prostates).  However, in most people there should be a constant flow of water. The way bladder infection-causing E. coli hold on is that they evolved  finger-like projections (fimbrae) they can use to stick to the walls of the bladder so they don’t get washed away. Almost 30 years ago, it was demonstrated that if you drip cranberry juice on E. coli, their fimbrae aren’t able to stick as well. Grape juice doesn’t work, nor does orange or apple juice. Even white cranberry juice made from unripened berries doesn’t work, suggesting that it’s one of the red phytonutrients that’s the active ingredient. For more on these natural plant compounds, see Phytochemicals: The Nutrition Facts Missing From the Label and for those doubting the power of plants, Power Plants. Even if it works in a petri dish, though, we don’t pee cranberry juice. How do we know that the anti-adherence phytonutrients are even absorbed through the gut and make it into the bladder? Subsequent studies have shown that if you drip the urine of someone who drank cranberry juice onto E. coli, they don’t stick as well either. Now we’re getting somewhere. If you check out my 4-min video Can Cranberry Juice Treat Bladder Infections?, you can see the stickiness of strains of E. coli wading in urine from someone drinking water, and the stickiness in the urine of someone drinking cranberry juice. Within hours of consumption there’s a drop in E. coli adherence that appears to last throughout much of the day. So might cranberries really help prevent bladder infections? The best way to prevent infections is to not get infected in the first place, which may involve the avoidance of chicken so you’re not constantly re-infecting yourself (see my last video Avoiding Chicken to Avoid Bladder Infections). If that doesn’t work, however—if your gut remains stubbornly colonized with these bad bladder bugs—various tested cranberry products appear to reduce the recurrence of bladder infections by about 35 percent. Not as effective as antibiotics, but cranberry juice doesn’t foster antibiotic resistance and has fewer side effects. There’s no good evidence to suggest cranberries are an effective treatment, though, which makes sense. Cranberries prevent the initial adherence, but that occurs at the start of the infection. When the infection is present and already stuck, there’s no clinical data to suggest that cranberries are effective in the treatment of urinary tract infections, meaning it doesn’t work better than placebo—but placebos work! For example, ibuprofen seems to work just as well as antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Some people really do need antibiotics—pregnant women, children, men, those with kidney infections, and systemic symptoms like nausea and vomiting. For most healthy women, though, bladder infections just go away on their own without antibiotics. Women who drink cranberry juice and have their symptoms disappear may falsely attribute their recovery to the juice. However, when it comes to most UTIs, nothing works–as in nothing, a sugar pill, actually works! I discuss the controversy around doctors giving placebos in The Lie That Heals: Should Doctors Give Placebos? What else can cranberries do? Check out my recent videos Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better? and Cranberries Versus Cancer. How can you consume cranberries palatably? Check out my recipe for Pink Juice with Green Foam. If cranberries are so good at keeping bacteria from sticking to the wall of the bladder, what about keeping bacteria from sticking to other places like our teeth? I touch on that in my video Childhood Tea Drinking May Increase Fluorosis Risk. 	-	antibiotics,bacteria,bladder disease,bladder health,bladder infection,cranberries,cranberry juice,e. coli,Escherichia coli,phytochemicals,phytonutrients,urinary tract infection,UTI,white cranberry juice	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-lie-that-heals-should-doctors-give-placebos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cranberries-versus-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21480803,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18253990,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/childhood-tea-drinking-may-increase-fluorosis-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-lie-that-heals-should-doctors-give-placebos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-fruit-fights-cancer-better/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-cranberry-juice-treat-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/avoiding-chicken-to-avoid-bladder-infections/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	
A-310	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/28/how-avoiding-chicken-could-prevent-bladder-infections/	How Avoiding Chicken Could Prevent Bladder Infections	Where do bladder infections come from? Back in the ’70s, longitudinal studies of women over time showed that the movement of rectal bacteria into the vaginal area preceded the appearance of the same types of bacteria in the urethra before they were able to infect the bladder. However, it would be another 25 years before genetic fingerprinting techniques were able to confirm this so-called fecal-perineal-urethral theory, indicating that E. coli strains residing in the rectal flora serve as a reservoir for urinary tract infections. And it would be another 15 years still before we tracked it back another step and figured out where that rectal reservoir of bladder infecting E. coli was coming from—chicken. Researchers were able to capture these extraintestinal (meaning outside of the gut), pathogenic, disease-causing E. coli straight from the slaughterhouse, to the meat, to the urine specimens obtained from infected women. We now have “proof of a direct link between farm animals, meat, and bladder infections,” solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis (an animal-to-human disease). Millions of women are infected with bladder infections every year, at a cost of more than a billion dollars. Even worse, researchers have detected multidrug resistant strains of E. coli in chicken meat resistant to some of our most powerful antibiotics. The best way to prevent bladder infections is the same way we can prevent all types of infections, by not getting infected in the first place. It’s not in all meat equally—beef and pork, for example, appear significantly less likely to harbor bladder-infecting strains than chicken. Can’t one just use a meat thermometer and cook the chicken thoroughly? We’ve known for 36 years that it’s not always the meat, but the cross-contamination, that causes the infection. If you give people frozen chickens naturally contaminated with antibiotic resistant E. coli and let people prepare and cook it in their own kitchen as they normally would, the bacteria ends up in their rectum even if they don’t actually consume the meat. That’s how they know it was cross-contamination, because the jump happened after the animal was prepared but before it was eaten. In one study five different strains of antibiotic resistant E. coli jumped from the chicken to the volunteer. So not only did it not matter how well the chicken was cooked, it didn’t even matter if one eats any! It was the bringing of the contaminated carcass into the home and handling it. Within days, the drug resistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person’s fecal flora. If you check out my 6-min video Avoiding Chicken To Avoid Bladder Infections, you can see all this drug resistant bacteria colonizing this person’s colon, yet the person hadn’t taken any antibiotics—it’s the chickens who were given the drugs. That’s why the industry shouldn’t be routinely feeding chickens antibiotics by the millions of pounds a year. It can end up selecting for and amplifying superbugs that may end up in our bodies. More on the threat of feeding antibiotics to farm animals by the ton in: What if we’re really careful in the kitchen, though? The pivotal study in this area was entitled “The Effectiveness of Hygiene Procedures for Prevention of Cross-Contamination from Chicken Carcasses in the Domestic Kitchen.” Researchers went into five dozen homes, gave each family a chicken, and asked them to cook it. I expected to read that they inoculated the carcass with a specific number of bacteria to ensure everyone got a contaminated bird, but no. They realized that fecal contamination of chicken carcasses was so common that they just went to the store and bought any random chicken. After the participants were done cooking it, there was bacteria from chicken feces (Salmonella and Campylobacter–both serious human pathogens) all over the kitchen—on the cutting board, the utensils, on their hands, on the fridge handle, on the cupboard,  the oven handle doorknob. Obviously people don’t know what proper handling and disinfection protocols entail. So the researchers took another group of people and gave them specific instructions. After they cooked the chicken they had to wash everything with hot water and detergent. They were told specifically to wash the cutting board, knobs on the sink, the faucet, the fridge, the doorknobs—everything. And the researchers still found pathogenic fecal bacteria all over. Fine. Last group. This time they were going to insist that people bleach everything. The dishcloth used to wipe up was to be immersed in bleach disinfectant. Then they sprayed the bleach on all kitchen surfaces and let it sit there for 5 minutes. And… they still found Campylobacter and Salmonella on some utensils, a dishcloth, the counter around the sink, and the cupboard. Definitely better, but unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab, the only way to guarantee we’re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into the house in the first place. The good news is that if we eat chicken once, we’re not colonized for life. In the study I profile in Avoiding Chicken To Avoid Bladder Infections, the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about 10 days in peoples’ guts before our good bacteria could muscle it out of the way. The problem is that people tend to eat chicken more than once every ten days, so they may be constantly re-introducing these chicken pathogens into their system. For example, a study found that if people are fed only sterilized meat that’s been boiled for an hour, within 3 weeks there’s a 500 fold drop in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria passing through their bodies. I originally explored this topic in Chicken Out of UTIs, but decided I needed to take a much deeper dive, especially in light of the cross-contamination issue, which I also  touched on in Food Poisoning Bacteria Cross-Contamination and Fecal Contamination of Sushi.

A-311	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/23/preventing-bacterial-vaginosis-with-diet/	Preventing Bacterial Vaginosis With Diet	In the same way fermented pickles, kimchi, and sauerkraut foster the growth of good bacteria by maintaining an acidic environment, so does the human vagina. The normal pH of one’s vagina is that of tomato juice. However, once it starts creeping up to that of coffee, an overgrowth of bad bacteria can take hold and cause bacterial vaginosis, which affects an astounding 29 percent of American women, nearly 1 in 3. That makes it the most frequent cause of vaginal complaints among younger women. It’s commonly diagnosed with the so-called “Whiff Test,” where the doctor takes a whiff of the vaginal discharge, sniffing for the characteristic fishy odor. The fishy odor is a consequence of a compound of decay called putrescine, which is also found in certain foods. More about these “biogenic amines” in: Traditional risk factors for bacterial vaginosis include douching, which has also been associated with a wide range of problems. With no demonstrable benefits and considerable evidence of harm, douching should be strongly discouraged. Medical professionals need to clearly explain to women that the vagina is naturally self-cleaning. Nasal douching, though, is another matter entirely. See The Risks and Benefits of Neti Pot Nasal Irrigation and my answer about the “brain-eating amoeba.” Recently, poor nutrition has been added to the list of risk factors for bacterial vaginosis. Women appear more likely to get bacterial vaginosis if they have lower circulating levels of phytonutrients like vitamin C and beta carotene in your bloodstream—indicating a lower intake of fruits and vegetables. In recent years, though, the field of nutrition has shifted toward examining overall dietary scores as opposed to single nutrients, because it has become recognized that nutrients are not consumed in isolation. To help consumers eat healthier foods, nutrient-rich food indices have been devised. Using these indices, researchers have found that the more nutrient rich one’s diet, the lower one’s apparent risk for bacterial vaginosis. Why might a healthier diet improve vaginal health? Researchers suggest that high fat intake, particularly saturated fat may increase vaginal pH, thereby increasing the risk of bacterial vaginosis. As you can see in the associated video Bacterial Vaginosis and Diet, most saturated fat in the American diet comes from dairy, desserts, and chicken. The researchers conclude: “The next steps ahead include sharing these findings with gynecologists, obstetricians, and general practitioners, as well as increasing the awareness of the general community to the importance of optimal nutrition… to prevent infections of the genital tract, reduce associated disease, and maintain reproductive health.” More on the detrimental effects of saturated fat in videos such as: More on vaginal health in Treating Genital Warts With Green Tea and more on achieving maximum nutrient density in Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score.

A-312	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/21/treating-migraines-with-lavender/	Treating Migraines With Lavender	Lavender has been studied recently for several purposes, including treatment of mood and anxiety disorders (see, for example, the video I profiled in my last post, Lavender for Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Though it’s better known for its analgesic (pain-killing) properties, there hasn’t been a single documented clinical trial on lavender for the treatment of migraine headaches, which affect tens of millions of Americans every year. That is, until now: “Lavender Essential Oil in the Treatment of Migraine Headache: A Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.” Migraine sufferers were asked—at the early signs of headache—to rub two to three drops of lavender essential oil onto their upper lip and inhale its vapor for a 15-min period, then score the severity of their headache for the next two hours. In the control group they did the same thing, but with drops of unscented liquid wax instead. Neither group was allowed to use any painkillers. In the lavender group 74 percent of patients had an improvement in their symptoms—significantly better than placebo. Although lavender wasn’t directly compared to more conventional treatments and outcome measures differed, as you can see in the associated video Lavender for Migraine Headaches, lavender appears to stack up pretty well against typical migraine drugs. Lavender helped about three quarters of the time; high dose Tylenol may only work about half the time; and Ibuprofen 57% of the time. The top prescription drug, generic Imitrex, is effective 59% of the time, and the hardcore treatment they use in emergency rooms where they inject you under the skin works 70% of the time. Fortunately all of these work better than the original migraine therapy, known as trepanning, where doctors drilled holes in our head to let the evil spirits escape! The lavender researchers concluded that the results of the study suggest that inhalation of lavender essential oil may be an effective and safe treatment modality in acute management of migraine headaches. Migraine sufferers may also want to experiment with avoiding potential triggers such as aspartame (see my video Diet Soda and Preterm Birth). Saffron may also help with headaches (Saffron for the Treatment of PMS) as well may the avoidance of certain parasites (Pork Tapeworms on the Brain and Avoiding Epilepsy Through Diet). A note of caution, though: Pregnant migraine sufferers seeking natural remedies should be wary of advice they may get (Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees). What’s better than treating your pain with natural remedies? Not having pain in the first place! Those eating healthy diets are less likely to be on pain medications in general (Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants).

A-313	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/14/using-lavender-to-treat-anxiety/	Using Lavender to Treat Anxiety	Lavender oil, which is distilled from lavender flowers, is often used in aromatherapy and massage. Despite its popularity, only recently have scientific investigations been undertaken into its biological activity. While there have been small-scale studies suggesting benefit from lavender oil massage, we didn’t know if the benefit was coming from the lavender, the massage, or both. In an attempt to separate these two variables, a study was conducted in which patients in intensive care were given massages with either odorless oil or lavender oil. While patients massaged with lavender oil did say they felt less anxious and more positive, there were no objective differences found in terms of blood pressure, breathing, or heart rate. Perhaps the lavender was just covering up the nasty hospital smells. Subsequent studies using more sensitive tests did find physiological changes, though. We now know the scent of lavender can actually change brain wave patterns, but we didn’t know what the implications were until recently. Studies have shown the scent of lavender makes people feel better as well as perform math faster and more accurately (whereas the smell of rosemary, for example, seemed only to enable folks to do the math faster, but not necessarily with greater accuracy). How else might one use natural means to improve cognitive performance? Check out my video Does a Drink Of Water Make Children Smarter? and for more brain hacking tips, Dietary Brain Wave Alteration. But what if we actually eat lavender flowers? Or in the case of the study I profile in my 3-min video Lavender for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, take capsules of lavender-infused oil so as to perform a double-blind study to compare lavender head-to-head to lorazepam (Ativan). Generalized and persistent anxiety is a frequent problem and is treated with benzodiazepines (also known as benzos or downers) like Ativan and Valium. Unfortunately, these substances can not only make one feel hungover, but they have a high potential for drug abuse and addiction. So researchers decided to give lavender a try. Ativan certainly reduced anxiety, but so did the lavender. By the end of the study you couldn’t tell which group was which, and among those that responded to either, the lavender actually seemed to work better. The spice saffron may be aromatherapeutic as well. See Wake Up and Smell the Saffron for its role in treating PMS, above and beyond its other effects on the brain (Saffron vs. Prozac, Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s, and Saffron Versus Aricept). Since lavender oil has no potential for drug abuse and no sedating side-effects, it appeared to be an effective and well-tolerated alternative to benzodiazepine drugs for amelioration of generalized anxiety.   One cautionary note, however: There was a case series published in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled “Prepubertal Gynecomastia Linked to Lavender and Tea Tree Oils.” They reported cases of young boys exposed to lavender-containing lotions, soaps, hair gels, and shampoos starting to develop breasts. These effects disappeared after the products were discontinued, suggesting that lavender oil may possess hormone-disrupting activity. Indeed, when dripped on estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, lavender does show estrogenic effects and a decline in male hormone activity. It’s unknown, however, if similar reactions occur inside the body when lavender flowers or lavender oil is ingested. There are some dietary components known to affect with the hormonal balance of young boys. Check out Dairy & Sexual Precocity. More on lavender in Lavender for Migraine Headaches. And more on dietary interventions for anxiety can be found in: For more flower power see my blog and videos on hibiscus tea (Better Than Green Tea) and chamomile tea (Red Tea, Honeybush, & Chamomile and Chamomile Tea May Not Be Safe During Pregnancy).

A-314	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/07/how-probiotics-affect-mental-health/	How Probiotics Affect Mental Health	Before Thorazine was invented in 1950, mental illness was often treated surgically. In fact, in 1949 the inventor of the lobotomy was awarded the Nobel Prize. Before tens of thousands were lobotomized, however, colectomy was all the rage. There was a theory that bad bacteria in the gut­ was the cause of mental illness. So the cure was to surgically remove the colon. Yes, the surgery killed about one in three–but when they didn’t die, surgeons claimed positive results. Some, for example, bragged that when they resected the colons of schoolchildren as a preventive measure there was a cessation of “abnormal sex practices” like masturbation (which was viewed at the time as a precursor for mental illness later in life). Reminds me of the mastectomies they used to perform for menstrual breast pain (Plant-Based Diets For Breast Pain). Others, though, suggested a less drastic approach, proposing that one could instead treat this “intestinal putrefaction” by changing the intestinal flora. Indeed, over a century ago there were reports of successfully treating psychiatric illnesses like depression with a dietary regimen that included probiotics. Doctors perceived a connection between depression and “feces deficient in quantity and moisture and very offensive in odor.” Reportedly, after the probiotic regimen not only did people feel better psychologically, but they had their “feces increase in quantity, become softer, and of regular consistency, and the offensive smell diminish….” Concurrent with the probiotics, however, all patients were started on a vegetarian diet—so it may not have been the probiotics at all. Why might the vegetarian diet alone have improved mood? Check out my videos Plant-Based Diet & Mood and the follow-up Improving Mood Through Diet as well as my serotonin series starting with Human Neurotransmitters in Plants. This entire field of inquiry remained dormant for about a hundred years, but a new discipline has recently emerged known as enteric (meaning intestinal) neuroscience. Our enteric nervous system—the collection of nerves in our gut—has been referred to as a “second brain” given its size, complexity, and similarity. We have as many nerves in our gut as we do in our spinal cord! The size and complexity of our gut brain is not surprising when considering the challenges posed by the interface. We have a hundred times more contact with the outside world through our gut than through our skin. We also have to deal with our 100 trillion little friends down there. That takes a lot of processing power. Anyone who’s had butterflies in their stomach knows that our mental state can affect our gut. Studies show that every day stresses can actually affect gut flora populations. An innovative study out of Australia looked at feces scraped from toilet paper used by undergrads during exam week. If you check out my 5-min video Gut Feelings: Probiotics and Mental Health, you can see how many bacteria the undergrads had in their feces before and after the exam. You’ll notice the effect lasted the whole week. Their findings show that our mental state can indeed affect our gut, but can our gut affect our mental state? We didn’t know until recently. Many suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome complain of gut dysfunction, so researchers tried giving sufferers probiotics to see if their mental and emotional state could be improved and it did appear to help. You can learn more about treating chronic fatigue syndrome in: What about for healthy people, though? A study entitled “Assessment of the Psychotropic Properties of Probiotics” marked a turning point in our thinking. Researchers found that one month of probiotics appeared to significantly decrease symptoms of anxiety, depression, anger and hostility. Until that study was published, the idea that probiotic bacteria administered to the intestine could influence the brain seemed almost surreal–like science-fiction. Well, science yes, but maybe not fiction.  Might people suffering from certain forms of mental health problems benefit from a fecal transplant from someone with more happy-go-lucky bacteria? We don’t know, but this apparent ability of probiotics to affect brain processes is one of the most exciting recent developments in probiotic research. Gut Feelings: Probiotics and Mental Health closes out my 4-part video series on the latest in probiotic science. I started with the two most established indications for their use in Preventing and Treating Diarrhea with Probiotics, then moved onto a more speculative use in Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics?, and then offered practical advice on how to best take probiotic supplements in Should Probiotics Be Taken Before, During, or After Meals? What else might our good bacteria be doing for us? They may help with weight control (Fawning Over Flora and Gut Flora & Obesity) and serve up anti-cancer compounds!

A-315	http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/01/02/how-should-i-take-probiotics/	How Should I Take Probiotics?	Foods appear to be better carriers for probiotics than supplements, but if one chooses to go with the supplement route, should they be taken before, during, or after meals? The package labeling on probiotic supplements is often confusing. Sometimes the consumer is instructed to take the probiotics with meals, sometimes before or after meals, and occasionally on an empty stomach. I was surprised to find so few actual data in the scientific literature concerning this topic, but that is par for the course for most dietary supplement advice. See, for example, my video series about how little pharmacists and natural food store employees know: The lack of information on how to take probiotics has led to serious confusion, both for the industry and the consumer. Surprisingly it doesn’t appear as if any studies had ever examined this question–until now. Researchers hoped to be able to measure probiotic concentrations throughout the entire process after taking a probiotic supplement minute-by-minute.  To do this, they had to build a fake digestive track with a fake stomach and intestines, but complete with real saliva and digestive enzymes, acid, bile, and other digestive fluids. What did they find? If you check out my 2-min video Should Probiotics Be Taken Before, During, or After Meals?, you can see the survival of three different types of probiotics before, during, and after meals. You can also see how the probiotics fared when taken in oatmeal and milk, milk alone, apple juice, or water. What did they find? Like vitamin D supplements, which should also probably be taken with meals for maximum efficacy (Take Vitamin D Supplements With Meals), probiotic bacterial survival was best when provided within 30 minutes before or simultaneously with a meal or beverage that contained some fat content. This study didn’t shed light on what dose we should take and under what circumstances, however. To see what the best available science says, see the first video in this series, Preventing and Treating Diarrhea with Probiotics. Then I compared probiotics to prebiotics in Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics? and moved to the effect of your gut flora on your mood in Gut Feelings: Probiotics and Mental Health. 	-	apple juice,dosage,fat,health food stores,milk,natural food stores,oatmeal,pharmacists,prebiotics,probiotics,supplements,vitamin D,water	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-and-treating-diarrhea-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-the-common-cold-with-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-probiotics-be-taken-before-during-or-after-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-feelings-probiotics-and-mental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22146689,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-316	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/31/probiotics-during-cold-season/	Probiotics during Cold Season?	Babies delivered via caesarean section appear to be at increased risk for various allergic diseases. The thought is that vaginal delivery leads to the first colonization of the baby’s gut with maternal vaginal bacteria. C-section babies are deprived of this natural exposure and have been found to exhibit a different gut flora. This concept is supported by research noting that a disturbance in maternal vaginal flora during pregnancy may be associated with early asthma in their children. This all suggests our natural gut flora can affect the development of our immune system (for better or for worse). In adulthood, two studies published back in 2001 suggested that probiotics could have systemic immunity-enhancing effects. Subjects given a probiotic regimen saw a significant boost in the ability of their white blood cells to chomp down on potential invaders. (You can watch a video of white blood cells doing their thing in my video Clinical Studies on Acai Berries. A must-see for biology geeks :). And even after the probiotics were stopped, there was still enhanced immune function a few weeks later compared to baseline (check out my 4-min video Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics? to see the graph). A similar boost was found in the ability of their natural killer cells to kill cancer cells. Improving immune cell function in a petri dish is nice, but does this actually translate into people having fewer infections? For that, we had to wait another 10 years, but now we have randomized double-blind placebo controlled studies showing that those taking probiotics may have significantly fewer colds, fewer sick days, and fewer symptoms. The latest review of the best studies to date found that probiotics, such as those in yogurt, soy yogurt, or supplements, may indeed reduce one’s risk of upper respiratory tract infection, but the totality of evidence is still considered weak, so it’s probably too early to make a blanket recommendation. Unless one has suffered a major disruption of gut flora by antibiotics or an intestinal infection—in other words unless one is symptomatic with diarrhea or bloating—I would suggest focusing on feeding the good bacteria we already have, by eating so-called prebiotics, such as fiber. After all, as I noted in Preventing and Treating Diarrhea with Probiotics, who knows what you’re getting when you buy probiotics. They may not even be alive by the time we buy them. Then they have to survive the journey down to the large intestine (Should Probiotics Be Taken Before, During, or After Meals?). Altogether, this suggests that the advantages of prebiotics—found in plant foods—outweigh those of probiotics. And by eating raw fruits and vegetables we may be getting both! Fruits and vegetables are covered with millions of lactic acid bacteria, some of which are the same type used as probiotics. So when studies show eating more fruits and vegetables boosts immunity, prebiotics and probiotics may be playing a role. How else might we reduce our risk of getting an upper respiratory infection? See: The immune boosting fruit and vegetable video I reference in Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics? is Boosting Immunity Through Diet.

A-317	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/26/probiotics-and-diarrhea/	Probiotics & Diarrhea	Probiotics have slowly moved from the field of alternative medicine into the mainstream, particularly for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the treatment of gastroenteritis. After taking antibiotics, up to 40 percent of people experience diarrhea. Administering probiotics along with the antibiotics, though, may cut this risk in half. Which kinds and how much? Lactobacillus rhamnosis and Saccharomyces boulardii appeared to be the most effective strains, and studies using more than 5 billion live organisms appeared to achieve better results than those using smaller doses. For example, taking 100 billion organisms seemed to work nearly twice as well as 50 billion in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Of course the best way to avoid antibiotic-associated diarrhea is to avoid getting an infection in the first place. See, for example: We can also try to avoid consuming antibiotics in our diet: Lowering Dietary Antibiotic Intake and More Antibiotics In White Meat or Dark Meat? The second well-established indication for the use of probiotics is in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea, shortening the duration of symptoms by about a day. We still don’t know the best probiotic doses and strains. Studies have used between 20 million organisms a day to 3 trillion, and there are thousands of different strains to choose from. Then, even if we wanted a particular strain, odds are the label is lying to us anyway. Less than a third of commercial probiotic products tested actually contained what the label claimed. About half had fewer viable organisms than stated, and half contained contaminant organisms–including potentially pathogenic ones–as well as mold. The mislabeling of probiotic supplements will come as no surprise to those who’ve been following my work. For example: Ideally, we’d repopulate our gut with the whole range of natural gut flora, not just one or two hand-picked strains. This has been attempted for serious infections, starting back in 1958. Patients were given a fecal enema. Gut bacteria was taken from a healthy colon and inserted into someone else’s unhealthy colon. Or we can go the other route and administer the donor stool through the nose. Evidently, this route of administration saves time, is cheaper, and less inconvenient for the patient. Preferred stool donors (in order of preference) were spouses or significant others, family members, and then anyone else they could find (including medical staff). Doctors picked a nice soft specimen, whipped it up in a household blender until smooth, put it through a coffee filter and then just squirted it up the patient’s nose through a tube and into their stomach. Don’t try this at home! How receptive were the patients to this rather unusual smoothie recipe? None of the patients in this series raised objections to the proposed stool transplantation procedure on the basis that it “lacked aesthetic appeal.”  However, since production of fresh material on demand is not always practical, researchers up in Minnesota recently introduced frozen donor material as another treatment option.  All described in great detail in the latest review on the subject out of Yale entitled, “The Power of Poop.” Another mention of frozen “poopsicles” can be found in my video Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen. Preventing and Treating Diarrhea with Probiotics is the first of a four-part series on the current state of probiotic science.

A-318	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/24/mushrooms-and-immunity/	Mushrooms & Immunity	There’re lots of products that promise to boost your immune system—who wouldn’t want that? Well, millions of people suffer from autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and allergies.  Their immune systems may already be a bit too active. I try to make sufferers of seasonal allergies feel better by explaining that having an overactive immune system is not all bad. Individuals with allergies have a decreased risk for cancer (compared with the general population). Yes, your immune system may be in such overdrive it’s attacking things left and right (like tree pollen), but that heightened state of alertness might also help bring down any budding tumors in the body. So it’s tricky; we want to boost the part of the immune system that fights infection, while down-regulating the part that results in chronic inflammation. And mushrooms may fit the bill. There are thousands of edible mushrooms, though only 100 are cultivated commercially, and only 10 of those on an industrial scale.  And I do mean industrial, rising to over 20 million metric tons a year, and for good reason. They accelerate immunoglobulin A secretion. Let me explain. Though skin is considered our largest organ, we actually interface with the outside world more through our mucous membranes, which occupy our largest body surface area. These include the lining of our mouth, our entire digestive tract, our reproductive and urinary systems, inside the breast glands, and on our eyeballs. Our gut alone covers more area than a tennis court and much of it is only one cell thick.  One microscopic layer is all that separates us from all the toxins, viruses, and bacteria out there, and so we need one heck of a first-line defense. That defense is called IgA, immunoglobulin A, our type A antibodies. Dietary intake of certain foods may improve mucosal immunity by accelerating IgA secretion, but no studies have ever been conducted on mushrooms, until now. In the study “Dietary Intake of…White Button Mushroom Accelerates Salivary Immunoglobulin A Secretion in Healthy Volunteers,” people were split into two groups. Half ate their normal diet; half ate their normal diet with cooked white button mushrooms every day for a week. Then using the “passive dribble method” for collecting saliva, scientists just measured the amount of IgA they were pumping out. If you check out my 5-min video Boosting Immunity While Reducing Inflammation you’ll see the graph. There was no change in the control group, but after a week of mushrooms, IgA secretion jumped 50% and even stayed up there for a week after they stopped the shrooms, before falling back to baseline. But if you continue to churn out 50% more antibodies, might that contribute to chronic inflammation, which is implicated in the development of a variety of diseases? No, in fact mushrooms appear to have an “anti-inflammatory capacity in vitro, suggesting that they could be regarded as a potential source of natural anti-inflammatory agents.” I show in the video a comparison of the anti-inflammatory properties of a variety of different varieties of mushrooms. Researchers think it might be the phytonutrient pyrogallol, found in mushrooms as well as in our old friend amla (Indian gooseberries), that similarly appears to reduce inflammation while at the same time boosting immune and anticancer function. See how else we can improve our immune function in Boosting Immunity Through Diet, Kale and the Immune System, and Sleep & Immunity. The balance between immune function and cancer is not always as straightforward as I noted. See my video series that starts with Cancer as an Autoimmune Disease.

A-320	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/19/black-raspberries-may-help-prevent-cancer/	Raspberries Reverse Precancerous Lesions	More berried treasure! A story similar to the strawberries and esophageal cancer revelation I documented in Strawberries versus Esophageal Cancer has emerged with black raspberries and oral cancer. Oral cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in the US with a flip-of-the-coin death rate. We can reduce our risk of oral cancer by avoiding all forms of tobacco, restricting alcohol consumption, avoiding obesity, and eating at least five servings of vegetables and fruits each day. Other risk factors include having more than 5 lifetime oral sex partners and prolonged (more than 20 years) marijuana use. But what if we already have precancerous changes in your mouth? Black raspberries appear to selectively inhibit the growth of both malignant and premalignant cells in a petri dish while leaving normal cells alone, but what about in an actual person? Researchers at Ohio State University took some folks with precancerous growths in their mouths (so called oral “intraepithelial neoplasia”) and had them apply a black raspberry gel for 6 weeks. Like the esophageal study with strawberries, most of the patients’ lesions improved, including cases of complete clinical regression. If you click to watch my 4-min video Black Raspberries versus Oral Cancer you can see the disease disappear–thanks to just berries! They were able to follow a reversal of genetic changes that had led to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. If you aren’t near a pick-your-own farm, black raspberries can be ordered online frozen but they’re about 20 bucks a pound with shipping. Black raspberry freeze-dried powder is comparatively cheaper, but I’ve always wondered about how much nutrition is lost. Well, there’s finally been a study. The antioxidant concentration was measured in fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried strawberries and strawberry jam, with the intent of measuring antioxidant content of foods typically available to consumers in grocery stores. On a consumed weight basis, the freeze-dried do shine, but just because an ounce of dried is equivalent to about a cup and a half of fresh. Jam, though, presumably because of the heat processing, really takes a hit (chart in my video Black Raspberries versus Oral Cancer). For more on what berries can do, see my videos Cranberries versus Cancer and Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better? I’ve previously covered the clinical trials of black raspberries (though in a different orifice) in Best Fruits For Cancer Prevention.

A-321	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/17/strawberries-can-reverse-precancerous-progression/	Strawberries Can Reverse Precancerous Progression	In my last two posts, Which Fruit is Best at Fighting Cancer? and Anti-Cancer Nutrient Synergy in Cranberries I described what various common fruits could do to human cancer cells in a petri dish.  Studies showing which foods can best suppress the growth of cancer in a test tube are all well and good, but we need to know if they can do the same thing within the human body. It’s considered unethical to withhold conventional cancer therapies to test out some fruit or vegetable, so what do you do? One direction researchers have taken is to use so-called “combinatorial strategies,” for example adding phytonutrients from the spice turmeric and green tea along with chemotherapy to see if that works better than chemo alone, but this gets complicated because chemo and radiation often work by killing cancer cells with free radicals and so though antioxidants may certainly reduce the toxicity of the treatment there’s a theoretical concern it could reduce the efficacy as well. Another way you can study the effects of plants on cancer is by testing dietary interventions on slow growing cancers like prostate, which is how Ornish and colleagues were able to show his apparent reversal in cancer growth with a plant-based diet (see Cancer Reversal Through Diet?). They could get away with treating cancer with a vegan diet alone (no chemo/surgery/radiation) because prostate can be such a slow growing cancer that patients with early disease can be placed in a holding pattern. So if you’re not going to do anything but watch and wait, you might as well test out a dietary intervention. Are there other cancers like that we can try plants on? Esophageal cancer is not the cancer to get. Five-year survival is only about 13 percent, with most people dying within the first year of diagnosis, but the development of esophageal cancer is a multistage process. We start out with a normal esophagus (the tube that connects you mouth to your stomach), then precancerous changes start to take place, then localized cancer starts to grow, then eventually it spreads and we most likely die. Because of the well-defined, stepwise progression of esophageal, researchers jumped on it as a way to test the ability of berries—the healthiest fruits—to reverse the progression of cancer. A randomized phase 2 clinical trial of strawberries for patients with precancerous lesions of the esophagus was undertaken. Six months of eating the equivalent of over a pound of fresh strawberries a day, and the progression of disease was reversed in 80 percent of the high dose strawberry treatment. At the beginning of the study, no subjects had a normal esophagus. They either had mild or moderate precancerous disease. But by the end of the study most lesions either regressed from moderate to mild, or disappeared completely. If you watch my 5-min video Strawberries versus Esophageal Cancer you can see some representative before and after pictures of the lesions literally disappearing. By the end of the study half of those on the high dose of strawberries walked away disease free. This landmark study is one of the most important papers I’ve seen recently. Why isn’t this headline news? If there was instead some new drug that reversed cancer progression, you can bet it would be all over the place. But who’s going to profit from revelations about berries? Other than, of course, the millions of people at risk for this devastating cancer. The findings were heralded as groundbreaking in an editorial in the journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. Given that it was written by a pair of pharmacy professors, though, they of course concluded “that the active components and molecular targets responsible for the efficacy of strawberries must be identified.” Instead of just eating strawberries they suggested that Big Pharma should try to make a strawberry-derived drug. Recent population studies suggest that other plant foods may be protective against esophageal cancer as well. Diets with lots of meat and fat appear to double the odds of cancer; and lots of fruits and vegetables may cut one’s odds of esophageal cancer in half. Studies have shown diets rich in foods from animal origin and poor in plant foods appear to increase esophageal cancer risk. And now we know at least one plant that may even reverse the course of disease if caught early enough. I touched previously on esophageal cancer in Bacon and Botulism and Poultry and Penis Cancer. More on strawberries in Cancer Fighting Berries and Maxing Out on Antioxidants. My favorite way to eat them? My chocolate ice cream recipe. Ornish’s line of anti-cancer work was continued by the Pritikin Foundation in an elegant series of experiments that I describe starting with Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay (along with the “prequel” Engineering a Cure).

A-322	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/12/anti-cancer-nutrient-synergy-in-cranberries/	Anticancer Nutrient Synergy in Cranberries	In research I profiled in my video Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better?, cranberries were found to suppress the growth of human liver cancer cells in vitro. Other studies have found similar effects against human breast, colon, brain tumor, oral, and ovarian cancer cells. In my 4-min video Cranberries versus Cancer I profile the latest looking at prostate cancer cell growth. The United States has the highest rate of prostate cancer in the world, so let’s try a native American fruit! Researchers started out with about 50,000 human prostate cancer cells in a petri dish and if you do nothing, within a day you’re closer to 100,000, then 200,000 and then nearly 400,000 within 72 hours. But by adding just a tiny amount of cranberries, that exponential cancer growth can be blocked. The reason they tested such tiny concentrations is that we only absorb a small fraction of the cranberry phytonutrients we eat into our bloodstream. Still, cranberries are cheap. If drug companies and supplement manufacturers are going to capitalize on this they needed to find cranberry’s active ingredient. In my video Cranberries versus Cancer I show a graph with some of the various phytonutrients in cranberries. Different fractions were tested against various types of cancer to find the magic bullet. Various fractions of phytonutrients inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation about 15 percent, but nothing compared to the total extract of the whole fruit. There seems to be additive or synergistic anti-proliferative effects resulting from the combination of the various components compared to individual purified phytochemicals. So it’s always better to eat the whole fruit. How do you do that with cranberries, though? Although five percent of cranberries are sold fresh, the vast majority are consumed as processed products. To get the same amount of anthocyanin phytonutrients in a cup of fresh or frozen cranberries, you’d have to drink 16 cups of cranberry juice cocktail, eat seven cups of dried cranberries, or 26 cans of cranberry sauce! The problem is that raw cranberries are so tart that folks may opt for the 7 cups of dried. In a taste test survey, consumers said they wouldn’t mind eating dried cranberries every day, but the preference for raw cranberries sloped down toward maybe once a year. The problem is dried cranberries tend to come sweetened. Raw cranberries don’t affect your blood sugar, but sweetened dried cranberries do—even the low sugar varieties. What about cranberry “juice”? Cranberry cocktail is usually only about a quarter cranberry juice. The ruby red phytonutrients in cranberries and pure cranberry juice are powerful antioxidants, increasing the antioxidant capacity of our bloodstream within hours of consumption. But the high fructose corn syrup acts as a pro-oxidant, even with added vitamin C, canceling out some of the cranberry benefit. So how do you get the upsides without the down? Check out my Pink Juice with Green Foam video, where I offer a recipe for making no added sugar whole fruit cranberry cocktail. And for another reason to avoid high fructose corn syrup: Mercury in Corn Syrup? More on nutrient synergy in: Suppressing cancer growth in a petri dish is nice, but what about within the human body?

A-323	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/10/which-common-fruit-fights-cancer-better/	Which Common Fruit Fights Cancer Better?	Recently, researchers compared the ability of eleven common fruits to suppress cancer cell growth in vitro. Which do you think was most effective—apples, bananas, cranberries, grapefruits, grapes, lemons, oranges, peaches, pears, pineapples, or strawberries? There are many ways to compare the healthfulness of different foods. For example, if you were interested in antioxidants you might compare vitamin C content. If you compared vitamin C content between our two most popular fruits, apples and bananas, then bananas would appear twice as healthy (10 mg in a banana compared to only 5mg in an apple). But vitamin C is just one of thousands of different phytonutrients in fruits and vegetables. It turns out the vitamin C in apples accounts for less than 1 percent of an apple’s total antioxidant activity. In my 5-min video Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better? I show a graph of the total antioxidant content of a red delicious apple. The amount contributed to the vitamin C is so tiny you can hardly see it. Even though there are only about 5mg of vitamin C in a small apple, it has the antioxidant equivalent of 1500 mg of vitamin C! I’ve reviewed before how taking that much vitamin C straight in a supplement may actually have a pro-oxidant effect and cause DNA damage (in my video Preventing Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress With Watercress), but you can get three times that antioxidant power eating an apple, without the adverse effects. Of course there’s more than just vitamin C in bananas too. I was surprised to see a study out of Harvard suggesting that bananas were a significant source of anthocyanins, the red/blue/violet phytonutrients found in berries. Maybe I underestimated bananas? They are, after all, technically berries. Anthocyanins have been found in blue, purple, orange-red, red-purple, and pink-purple wild bananas, but none in domesticated yellow. In the Harvard researchers’ defense, they just took values from the USDA, and it turns out USDA apparently made a mistake. There are no anthocyanins in store-bought bananas, and despite twice the vitamin C, bananas are beat out by apples in terms of overall antioxidant power. But that’s just measuring the ability of these fruits to quench an oxidation reaction in a test tube. It would be nice to measure actual biological activity. In the red delicious apple study, researchers also measured the ability of apple extracts, from both peeled and unpeeled apples, to suppress the growth of human cancer cells growing in a petri dish compared to control. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to compare that kind of superpower between different fruits? Well, now we can! In my video Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better? I show a graph of cancer cell proliferation versus increasing concentrations of the 11 most common fruits eaten in the United States. If you drip water on these cancer cells as a control, nothing happens. They start out powering away at 100 percent growth and they keep powering away at 100 percent growth. And pineapples, pears, and oranges don’t do much better. Peaches start pulling away from the pack. At high peach concentrations, cancer cell proliferation drops about 10 percent, but bananas and grapefruits appear to work four times better, dropping cancer growth rates by about 40 percent. Red grapes, strawberries and apples do even better, cutting cancer cell growth up to half at only half the dose, but the two fruits that won, causing a dramatic drop in cancer proliferation at just tiny doses, were lemons and cranberries. So if you look at the effective dose required to suppress liver cancer cell proliferation, apples are more powerful than bananas, but cranberries win the day. And there was no effective dose listed for orange, pear, and pineapple since they didn’t appear to affect the cancer cell growth at all. This study reminded me of my #1 Anticancer Vegetable video (along with its “prequel,” Veggies vs. Cancer). Other videos in which I rank various foods include: How can you consume cranberries palatably, though? Check out my recipe for Pink Juice with Green Foam and my video Cranberries versus Cancer.

A-325	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/12/03/half-of-doctors-give-placebos/	Half of Doctors Give Placebos	About half of doctors admit to intentionally deceiving patients by prescribing placebos, but might the ends justify the means? A controversial paper was published in the American Journal of Bioethics arguing that it’s not only OK for doctors to lie to patients, but that we have a “duty to deceive.” Unlike what you see on television, roughly half the time a patient walks into a doctor’s office, a firm diagnosis cannot be made. Half the time the doctor doesn’t know what’s going on. So why not give the patient a sugar pill, such as a homeopathic remedy—which is often just that, an actual sugar pill—or something like a Bach flower remedy? Just because they don’t work better than placebo, doesn’t mean they don’t work (see my video Is Homeopathy Just Placebo?). Placebos are certainly safer than prescribing an actual drug. As I document in my Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death video, prescription drugs kill an estimated 106,000 Americans a year, effectively making doctors the 6th leading cause of death. Even just offering a made-up diagnosis and false reassurance seems to work. In one landmark study, two hundred patients for whom no definite diagnosis could be made were randomized into two groups. The honesty group was told “I don’t know what’s wrong with you,” and the dishonesty group was given some fake but firm diagnosis and told confidently they’d get better in a few days—and guess what, they did! They were 90 percent more likely to be cured. A “Deception Flowchart” has even been devised to help us doctors decide, for example, if we should consider a “lying” versus a “non-lying deception” to meet objectives. Those on the pro-truth side of the fence argue that first of all, placebos aren’t necessarily always safe. The sugar in the sugar pills is typically lactose (milk sugar), for which most of humanity is intolerant after infancy. There was a famous cancer drug trial in which the chemotherapy caused a surprising reduction in nausea and vomiting compared to placebo, but that may have been because it was compared to a placebo made out of lactose. See my video Infant Nearly Killed by Homeopathy for an extreme example of this. Pro-truth advocates accuse doctors of disease-mongering. By defining vague symptoms as an entity requiring a treatment, healthy people are converted into patients. “They need explanation and reassurance that promote autonomy,” reads one editorial, “not to be given faith in a non-existent disease and crackpot medicine.” If all one cares about is beneficial medical consequences, “might not doctors also have a duty to prescribe things like chanting, crystals, and séances?” Deception advocates reply: “Doctors have a duty to do the best they can to relieve a patient’s symptoms. If that means they prescribe a placebo, or even conduct a séance…then there is a duty to do these things. If a doctor can really convince a patient that a chant will cure his headache, then it very likely will, and she should ululate it at the top of her lungs.” In fact, “It is a type of deception that patients ought to be thankful for, just as we are thankful when we receive a mendacious compliment from a friend.” Of course you don’t look fat in that dress! So how many doctors lie to their patients? About half of surveyed internal medicine doctors and rheumatologists in the United States report prescribing placebo treatments on a regular basis. Similar numbers have been found in Canada, Europe, Israel, and New Zealand. See my video The Lie That Heals: Should Doctors Give Placebos? to see the studies themselves. Surveys show that prescribing placebo treatments seems to be common and is viewed as ethically permissible by physicians. I personally find it ironic that physicians often condemn alternative medicine quacks for giving useless remedies when they themselves do the same thing. As one physician commented, “The vow we take is the Hippocratic oath—not the hypocritic one.” 	-	dairy,deception,deception flow chart,doctors,false diagnosis,homeopathy,lactose,lactose intolerance,lies,lying,medicine,milk,physicians,placebos,prescription drugs	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-homeopathy-just-placebo/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-nearly-killed-by-homeopathy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-lie-that-heals-should-doctors-give-placebos/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-homeopathy-just-placebo/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20013498,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/infant-nearly-killed-by-homeopathy/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20013497,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20013484,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2193166,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20013482,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-lie-that-heals-should-doctors-give-placebos/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3109581,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-326	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/28/breast-cancer-alcohol-how-much-is-safe/	Breast Cancer & Alcohol: How Much is Safe?	Nearly 5,000 breast cancer deaths a year may be attributable to just light drinking (up to one drink a day). The International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organization body tasked with collating the totality of evidence as to whether or not something causes cancer, has now concluded that alcoholic beverages—all alcoholic beverages—are to be considered carcinogenic to humans. There has been convincing evidence that alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer, but most of the data were derived from studies that focused on the effect of moderate or high alcohol intakes, while little was known about light alcohol drinking (up to 1 drink/day). A recent meta-analysis of studies that compared light drinkers to non-drinkers found a moderate but significant association with breast cancer, based on the results of more than 100 studies. The researchers estimate that about 5,000 breast cancer deaths a year are attributable to light drinking, meaning nearly 5,000 women that died of breast cancer maybe wouldn’t have if they had stayed away from alcohol completely, leading to an editorial in the medical journal Breast that concluded “women who consume alcohol chronically have an increased risk for breast cancer that is dose dependent but without threshold.” No threshold means there’s apparently no level of alcohol consumption that doesn’t raise breast cancer risk at least a little. Any level of alcohol consumption appears to increase the risk of developing an alcohol-related cancer. For example, the Harvard Nurses’ Study found that even consumption of less than a single drink per day may be associated with a modest increase in risk. Most recent research has focused on acetaldehyde, the first and most toxic alcohol metabolite, as the primary cancer-causing agent. The bacteria in our mouths appear to oxidize alcohol into this acetaldehyde carcinogen, which we then swallow. So even a single sip of alcohol may be harmful. A new study found that just holding a teaspoon of hard liquor in our mouth for 5 seconds results in carcinogenic concentrations of acetaldehyde—even if we don’t swallow. The exposure continues for at least 10 min after spitting it out. No surprise then alcohol-containing mouthwash can offer a carcinogenic spike as well. Researchers conclude: “All in all, there is a rather low margin of safety in the use of alcohol-containing mouthwash. Typical use will reach the concentration range above which adverse effects are to be expected. Until the establishment of a more solid scientific basis for a threshold level of acetaldehyde in saliva, prudent public health policy would recommend generally refraining from using alcohol in such products.” So why isn’t the same recommendation made for alcoholic beverages? Well, as the Harvard paper concludes, “individuals will need to weigh the risks of light to moderate alcohol use on breast cancer development against the benefits for heart disease prevention to make the best personal choice regarding alcohol consumption.” They’re talking about the famous J shaped curve (watch my 4-min video Breast Cancer and Alcohol: How Much is Safe? to check it out). While smoking is bad and more smoking is worse, and in general exercising is good and more exercise is better, for alcohol there appears to be a beneficial effect of small doses. A six-pack a day raises overall mortality, but so does teetotalling. The #1 killer of women isn’t breast cancer, but heart disease, and a drink a day reduces the risk of heart disease. Why just reduce the risk of heart disease, though, when you may nearly eliminate the risk of heart disease with a healthy enough diet? See, for example, my video Eliminating the #1 Cause of Death. A plant-based diet that excludes certain plant-based (alcoholic) beverages may therefore be the best for overall longevity. For more on this topic, please see my follow-up video Breast Cancer Risk: Red Wine vs. White Wine. I’ve also previously addressed the pros and cons in Alcohol Risks vs. Benefits. The other mouthwash video I refer to in the above video is Don’t Use Antiseptic Mouthwash, part of a video series on improving athletic performance with nitrate-containing vegetables (if interested, start here: Doping With Beet Juice).

A-327	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/26/best-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/	Best Nutrition Bang for Your Buck	When measured on a cost per serving, cost per weight, or cost per nutrition basis, fruits and vegetables beat out meat and junk food: Most Americans don’t even meet the watered down Federal dietary recommendations. Some have suggested this is because healthy foods are more expensive, but is that true? It depends on how you measure the price. For over a century the value of food has been measured cost per calorie. If you were a brickmaker in Massachusetts in 1894, you may have needed more than 8000 calories a day. The emphasis was therefore on cheap calories. So while beans and sugar both cost the same back then–5 cents a pound–table sugar beat out beans for fuel value. Of course food offers much more than just calories, but they can be excused for their ignorance, since vitamins and minerals hadn’t even been discovered yet. Even to this day, though, when the cost of foods are related to their nutritive value, the value they’re talking about is cheap calories. When you rank foods like that, then indeed junk food and meat is cheaper per calorie than fruits and vegetables, but that doesn’t take serving size into account. If you measure foods in cost per serving or cost per pound fruits and vegetables are actually cheaper (see the graphs in my 3-min video Eating Healthy on a Budget). For all metrics except the price of food calories, the USDA researchers found that healthy foods cost less than less healthy foods. Most importantly, though, which is going to have the most nutrition? In the graphs in Eating Healthy on a Budget I show the average nutrient density of fruits, vegetables, refined grains, meats, milk, and empty calorie foods. Turns out that while junk food may be 4 times cheaper than vegetables, there’s 20 times less nutrition. For meat, we’d be spending 3 times more to get 16 times less. Conclusion: “Educational messages focusing on a complete diet should consider the role of food costs and provide specific recommendations for increasing nutrient-dense foods by replacing some of the meat with lower-cost nutrient-dense foods…Modifying traditional mixed dishes to incorporate more beans/legumes and less meat may be a cost-effective way to improve diet quality.” That’s good advice for everyone, not just low-income populations. In my video, Eating Healthy on a Budget, I also show what 100 calories of cheese, candy, chicken, chips, bread, oil, fruits or vegetables looks like.  Which hundred calories do you think would fill you up more? I explore the calorie density of other foods in my video Diet vs. Exercise for Weight Loss.

A-328	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/21/schoolchildren-should-drink-more-water/	Schoolchildren Should Drink More Water	Most children arrive at school in a state of mild dehydration that may negatively affect scholastic performance. Preventing cellular dehydration is integral to hormonal, immune, neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, muscle and skeletal function. So researchers recently set out to determine the hydration status of healthy children in the United States. Urine samples were obtained from groups of 9 to 11 year olds in Los Angeles and Manhattan on their way to school to see how they were doing. The study was motivated by recent studies in Israel showing children did not seem to be hydrated enough. But Israel’s in a desert, so they wanted to repeat the study under cooler and less arid conditions. It turns out the U.S. kids did just as bad as the Israelis. As I show in my video Does a Drink Of Water Make Children Smarter?, urine from nearly two-thirds of the U.S. kids studied was considered too concentrated, an indicator that they were dehydrated. Why? They weren’t drinking enough water. Three-quarters of the kids did not drink water between the time they woke up and when they went off to school. But most ate breakfast, so they must have been drinking something. The problem is that other beverages are not as hydrating. The levels of sodium, sugars, and amino acids in milk and juice can shrink cells and trigger the release of the hormone that spurs dehydration. So what, though? Is there any actual negative impact of mild dehydration on one’s ability to function at school? Historically, most of the studies on hydration and mental functioning were done on adults under extreme conditions, like having people exercise in 113 degree heat, or giving people powerful diuretics like Lasix and putting them on a treadmill. Most of the studies on hydration and cognitive performance have been performed on military personnel to evaluate soldiers’ ability to function in extreme circumstances. It is easy to imagine that a soldier fighting in the desert with a heavy rucksack and a protective suit must be physically and cognitively at his best. It is, however, very difficult to translate this knowledge to normal real-life circumstances. Three new studies changed that. They were simple studies. Researchers took a group of schoolchildren, randomly allocated them to drink a cup of water or not, and then gave them all a test to see who did better. And the winner was… the cup-of-water group. Conclusion: “The results of the present study suggest that even children in a state of mild dehydration, not induced by intentional water deprivation or by heat stress and living in a cold climate, can benefit from drinking more water and improve their cognitive performance.” So water worked for 2nd and 3rd graders, what about 1st grade? Same experimental design but this time instead of forcing kids in the water group to drink a cup, the water group was just given some water and told to drink as much they wanted, and again found significant improvement in the performance of various tasks, leading to the same conclusion: “[E]ven under conditions of mild dehydration…children’s cognitive performance can be improved by having a drink of water.” The latest study that just came out is the largest to date.  It too found a remarkable proportion of children were in a state of mild, voluntary dehydration at the beginning of the school day and a significant negative correlation between dehydration and, for example, the ability to remember numbers. The researchers offered a randomized group some water, and those kids on average felt better and performed better. “To conclude…[mild dehydration] is an adverse state that might render the school day more challenging for children.” Even doctors often apparently fail to realize the connection. A recent survey found that healthcare professionals under-recognized the importance of proper hydration for mental health. Who would care enough about the importance of human hydration to even do a survey? A “Hydration Institute” founded in part by…The Coca-Cola company. These three new studies found drinking resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive performance, but not with Coke. And not with Ritalin or some new drug, either. Just plain water. Think how much drug companies could make if they could sell sugar pills but just tell kids to take the fake pill with… a glass of water. This is one of those groundbreaking findings (like my gargling video) that will likely never see the light of day because there’s no profit motive for promotion. We’re guaranteed to be assailed about all the new drugs and surgical advances because there’s big business behind getting the word out. But who profits from tap water? Or even broccoli for that matter? That’s one of the reasons I created NutritionFacts.org, to bring to light all the findings that would otherwise just get buried in medical library basements (or, increasingly, vast private databases). The water content of plant foods may help explain why those eating plant-based diets are, on average, so slim. Like fiber, water is a source of Nutrition Without Calories. See Dietary Guidelines: It’s All Greek to the USDA for a country with the guts to suggest water might be preferable to drinking soda. Juice and milk may not be as hydrating as water. What about tea?

A-329	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/19/why-are-eggs-linked-to-cancer-progression/	Why are Eggs Linked to Cancer Progression?	About two million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer, but that’s better than dying from prostate cancer. Catch it when it’s localized and our 5-year survival is practically guaranteed, but once it really starts spreading our chances drop to 1 in 3. So Harvard researchers took more than a thousand men with early stage prostate cancer and followed them for a couple years to see if there was anything in their diet associated with a resurgence of the cancer, such as spread to the bone. Compared to men who hardly ate any eggs, men who ate even less than a single egg a day had a significant 2-fold increased risk of prostate cancer progression. The only thing worse was poultry (with skin) consumption, which showed up to 4 times the risk of progression among high-risk men. Researchers believe the higher risk might be caused by the cooked meat carcinogens (heterocyclic amines) that build up more in chicken and turkey muscle than in other meats. But what about the eggs? Why would less than once a day egg consumption double the risk of cancer progression? The Harvard paper suggests that the choline in eggs may increase inflammation. As I explained in my video Carnitine, Choline, Cancer and Cholesterol: The TMAO Connection, eggs are the most concentrated common source of choline in the American diet, which may increase the risk of cancer emergence, spread, and lethality. Another Harvard study, entitled Choline Intake and the Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer, found that those with the highest choline intake had a 70% increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. Another recent study found that men who consumed 2 and a half or more eggs per week—that’s just like one egg every three days—had an 81% increased risk of lethal prostate cancer. In the New England Journal of Medicine the same Cleveland Clinic research team that performed the famous study on carnitine (see my last post Avoid Carnitine and Lethicin Supplements), tried feeding people hard-boiled eggs instead of steak. As they suspected, the egg-eaters experienced a spike of the same TMAO compound associated with red meat consumption (and strokes, heart attack, and death). It’s ironic that the choline content of eggs is something the egg industry actually boasts about. And they are aware of the cancer connection. Through the Freedom of Information Act I was able to get my hands on an email (displayed in my 9-min video Carnitine, Choline, Cancer and Cholesterol: The TMAO Connection) from the executive director of the industry’s Egg Nutrition Center to an American Egg Board executive talking about how choline may be a culprit in promoting cancer progression: “Certainly worth keeping in mind as we continue to promote choline as another good reason to consume eggs.” For another behind-the-curtain peek at the egg industry, see Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis and Egg Industry Blind Spot. 	-	American Egg Board,beef,cancer progression,carcinogens,carnitine,chicken,choline,cooked meat,early detection,Egg Nutrition Center,eggs,heart attack,heterocyclic amines,inflammation,meat,men's health,metastases,mortality,plant-based,poultry,prostate cancer,prostate disease,prostate health,steak,stroke,TMAO,turkey,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21930800,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22952174,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/14/avoid-carnitine-and-lethicin-supplements,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042525,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-330	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/14/avoid-carnitine-and-lethicin-supplements/	Avoid Carnitine & Lethicin Supplements	A landmark study in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that choline in eggs, poultry, dairy and fish produces the same toxic TMAO as carnitine in red meat, which may help explain plant-based protection from heart disease. Earlier this year, a research team at the Cleveland Clinic offered another explanation as to why meat intake may be related to mortality (see, for example, Harvard’s Meat and Mortality Studies). They noted that “Numerous studies have suggested a decrease in atherosclerotic disease risk  [our  number 1 killer] in vegan and vegetarian individuals compared to omnivores,” but reduced intake of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat may not be the full story.  The researchers found that within 24 hours of carnitine consumption—eating a sirloin steak, taking a carnitine supplement—certain gut bacteria metabolize the carnitine to a toxic substance called trimethylamine, which then gets oxidized in our liver to TMAO, trimethylamine-n-oxide, which then circulates throughout our bloodstream. There’s a diagram in my 9-min video Carnitine, Choline, Cancer and Cholesterol: The TMAO Connection. The way we know it’s the gut bacteria is that if you give people antibiotics to wipe out their friendly flora, you can apparently eat all the steak you want without making any TMAO, but then if you wait a couple weeks until your gut bacteria grows back, you’re back to the same problem. What’s so bad about this TMAO stuff? It appears to increase the buildup of cholesterol in the inflammatory cells in the atherosclerotic plaques in our arteries, increasing our risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. The role of these inflammatory “foam” cells (so-called because they’re so packed with cholesterol they look foamy under a microscope) is explained in my video series that starts with Arterial Acne and Blocking the First Step of Heart Disease. What does carnitine do? It’s involved in energy production in the mitochondria (“power plants”) in our cells. The enzyme that uses carnitine to help us burn fat, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, is actually upregulated by about 60 percent in those eating meat-free diets, which may help explain why those eating plant-based diets tend to be slimmer. More details in my video How to Upregulate Metabolism. How do we keep carnitine away from our gut bacteria? Well there’s zero dietary requirement; our body normally makes all that we need. The problem is that the bodies of other animals also make all that they need so when we eat them, their carnitine can end up in our gut for those bacteria to feast upon, resulting in TMAO. Some animals make more carnitine than others. Carnitine is concentrated in red meat, and so this new body of research has led to recommendations to decrease red meat consumption as well as avoid carnitine-containing supplements and energy drinks. What most media reports missed, though, is that gut bacteria can turn the choline found in eggs, poultry, fish, dairy, and lecithin supplements into TMAO too. So it’s not just a problem with red meat. The good news is that this may mean a new approach to prevent or treat heart disease: “The most obvious is to limit dietary choline intake.” But if that just means decreasing egg, meat and dairy consumption, the “new” approach sounds just like the old approach. Unlike carnitine, we do need to take in some choline, so should vegans be worried about the modest amounts of choline they’re getting from beans, veggies, grains, and fruit? And same question with carnitine. There’s a small amount of carnitine found in fruits, veggies, and grains as well. Of course it’s not the carnitine itself we’re worried about, but the toxic TMAO, and you can feed a vegan a steak without getting a TMAO spike. Literally. The researchers convinced a long-time vegan to eat an 8-ounce sirloin, in the name of science. The vegan got the whopping carnitine load, but hardly any TMAO was produced. Apparently, the vegans don’t develop those TMAO-producing bacteria in their gut, and why would they? It’s like the whole prebiotic story I detail in videos like Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics. When we eat a lot of fiber, we select for fiber-munching bacteria, and some of the compounds they make with fiber are beneficial, like the propionate that appears to have an anti-obesity effect I explored in Fawning Over Flora. It seems that if we eat a lot of animal products we may instead be selecting for animal-munching bacteria, and some of those waste products—like the trimethylamine—may be harmful. 	-	atherosclerosis,beans,beef,carnitine,carnitine palmitoyl transferase,chicken,cholesterol,choline,dairy,death,dietary cholesterol,eggs,energy drinks,fish,foam cells,fruit,grains,gut bacteria,gut flota,heart attack,heart disease,inflammatory cells,lethicin,meat,metabolism,milk,mortality,plant-based diet,plaque,pork,poultry,red meat,saturated fat,stroke,TMAO,trimethylamine-n-oxide,vegan,vegetables,vegetarian,weight loss	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fawning-over-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-upregulate-metabolism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-good-bacteria-in-the-colon-without-probiotics/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fawning-over-flora/,http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1109400?query=featured_home,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23563705,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-upregulate-metabolism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arterial-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-good-bacteria-in-the-colon-without-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-331	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/12/treating-breast-pain-with-flax-seeds/	Treating Breast Pain with Flax Seeds	A tablespoon a day of ground flax seeds appears to improve ovarian function and is considered a first-line therapy for breast pain associated with one’s period (cyclical mastalgia). A study I profile in my video Flax Seeds For Breast Pain on the effect of flax seed ingestion on the menstrual cycle found a tablespoon a day lengthened the luteal phase (latter half of the cycle), effectively delaying one’s next period by about a day. Flax seeds also resulted in fewer anovulatory cycles (months in which you fail to ovulate). These are the same kind of improvements in ovarian function that have been found in women eating plant-based diets. In fact, women eating vegan never failed to ovulate in a study comparing meateaters, vegetarians, and vegans, which is similar to what was found in women eating flax daily. Since the same hormonal changes associated with eating more plant-based diets seemed to improve premenstrual and menstrual symptoms such as breast pain (see my video Plant-Based Diets For Breast Pain), researchers decided to test whether flax seeds would help as well. Although hormone treatments can be helpful, they often cause unpleasant side effects and there may be risks associated with long-term hormonal therapy.  Dietary flaxseed is therefore an attractive alternative for controlling these symptoms. So, 116 young women with severe menstrual breast pain were randomized in a double-blind study and given either a muffin containing about 3 and a half tablespoons of flax seed or a placebo muffin with no flax, and then followed for a few cycles. There was some placebo muffin effect, but there was a significantly greater reduction in reported breast pain, breast swelling, and breast lumpiness in the flax seed group. The study concluded that “flax seed is effective in relieving symptoms of cyclical mastalgia without significant side effects and might be considered as an alternative treatment for cyclical mastalgia.” But if flaxseed works, and there are only good side effects, why is it an alternative treatment? Why isn’t it the primary, first-line therapy? Well, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not issued treatment guidelines, but the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has. In their official guidelines they dispel the myth that caffeine is to blame or that vitamin E supplements are helpful. Instead, they prescribe dietary flaxseed “as a first-line therapy for cyclical breast pain.” Drugs are to be considered only if the flax doesn’t work. So nice to see a professional medical association prioritize safe, natural therapies!

A-332	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/07/treating-breast-pain-with-diet/	Treating Breast Pain with Diet	As I explore in my video Plant-Based Diets For Breast Pain, eating healthy appears to offer relief from a variety of menstrual symptoms, including cramping, bloating, and breast pain. Breast pain accompanying one’s period, called cyclical mastalgia, was dismissed in the 70s as ”merely an expression of psychoneurosis.” Women with breast pain were labeled “frustrated unhappy nulliparae,” meaning they were just upset that they hadn’t given their husbands children yet. Now we know what women always knew, breast pain is all too common, and its effect on quality of life is underestimated. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of women experience some type of breast pain at some stage of their lives, and in 10 to 20 percent of cases it is severe. Some breast tenderness during one’s cycle is normal, but breast pain is not. In many cases, surgery was prescribed. Thankfully by the 21st century the medical community had switched course. “We live in an era of evidence-based surgery,” read a 1999 review, “which behooves us all to justify the surgery we undertake.” What a concept! So the profession stopped cutting off the breasts of women in pain. The hormone prolactin is considered to be a central factor, as women with cyclical breast pain have elevated levels, and a prolactin inhibitor drug was found to be an effective treatment. The side effects of the drug are so bad, though, that some women are unable to stay on it. There had to be better way. Well, while up to two-thirds of Western women suffer from breast pain in their lifetimes, it apparently may affect as few as 1 in 6 women in Asian countries. Researchers suspected it might have to do with their lower fat diet. For example, women eating traditional plant-based diets all their lives, like rural Bantu African women, have lower prolactin levels. Their extraordinarily low rates of chronic disease in general were actually one of the inspirations for Nathan Pritikin’s work (see the series of videos that starts with Engineering a Cure). How do we know these differences between countries aren’t just genetic? Well, when researchers fed Bantu women a Western diet—meat, butter, milk, eggs, bread and sugar—for a few weeks, they experienced a significant rise in prolactin. Their hormonal changes on a Westernized diet were comparable to those found in Western women with menstrual irregularities. What part of the Western diet was responsible, though—maybe it was the bread and sugar? To see if it was the meat, researchers took some New Yorkers and put them on a vegetarian diet for two weeks, and that alone brought their prolactin levels down, suggesting that meat was the culprit. So researchers decided to give it a try for breast pain. The first pilot study involved ten women with severe cyclical mastalgia. They were put on a more plant-based low fat diet for three months and all ten women got better. There was no control group, though, so part of their improvement may have just been the placebo effect. Thus a randomized controlled trial was undertaken. A Canadian research group had been carrying out a clinical trial of dietary fat reduction in patients with precancerous breast changes, and they noted that that patients with cyclical breast problems frequently experienced striking relief of symptoms after reduction of dietary fat, so they randomized half the women into a lower fat group. Again, a significant improvement in symptoms was found. Since then, we learned that vegetarian women have fewer menstrual disturbances than nonvegetarian women. Only about five percent of the cycles of vegetarian women were found to be anovulatory (meaning they failed to release an egg) compared to 15 percent of nonvegetarian menstrual cycles.  Those eating more plant-based low fat diets may also experience significantly less bloating compared to placebo, and women with painful menstrual cramps placed on a vegan diet experienced significant relief. Researchers designed a “crossover” study where they put meat-eating women on a plant-based diet for two cycles, and then switched them back to their regular diet with some placebo supplement to show changes before and after dietary improvement, and then back at baseline. The problem the researchers discovered, though, is that several participants felt so much better that they refused to go back to their regular diet, violating the study protocols. Bottom line, the researchers concluded that a plant-based diet may offer relief from breast pain, as well as “significant reductions in menstrual pain duration, pain intensity, and duration of premenstrual symptoms related to concentration, behavioral change, and water retention [bloating].” Some plants may work better than others. See Saffron for the Treatment of PMS and Wake Up and Smell the Saffron, as well as the follow-up video Flax Seeds For Breast Pain.

A-333	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/11/05/tarragon-toxicity/	Tarragon Toxicity?	Decades ago, concern was raised about some of the components of the herb tarragon. The European Union’s Health & Consumer Protection Scientific Committee on Food concluded that one of the constituents may act as a carcinogen and damage DNA, and so recommended its use be restricted. But they were talking about an isolated chemical from tarragon being used as a flavoring agent in items like alcoholic beverages, canned fish, and fats and oils. As recently as 2011, reviews concluded that consumption of the tarragon leaves themselves should present little or no risk, but that was based on studies done on rats. A 2012 study made me feel better, suggesting that while the isolated tarragon chemical was toxic to human liver cells, full extracts of the leaves were not, so the whole food may contain compounds that counteract the toxic effects. I was going to leave it at that and not even do a video about it, but a 2013 study on human white blood cells reopened the question, finding that whole leaf tarragon extracts may have DNA damaging properties after all. I show the results of the comet test in my 3-min video The Safety of Tarragon.  For those scratching their heads over the significance of that red smudge, see my explanation of the comet tail test in Cancer, Interrupted: Garlic & Flavonoids. The researchers postulate that tarragon does indeed appear to be mutagenic, however the current data is “not comprehensive enough to draw definitive conclusions regarding its potential risk to human health with sustained use.” “Nevertheless,” they warn, “future use of tarragon… should be undertaken with an awareness of the… potential toxicity.” So what have I taken away from all this? Well my family eats tarragon so rarely that it’s probably not going to change our intake at all, but if you’re a tarragon fanatic, I’d suggest moderating your intake and substituting another herb like a dash of fennel or anise seed, or chervil, all of which have a similar licorice-like tarragon taste. The only caveat I could find for chervil is that you probably shouldn’t pick it wild, as it bears a resemblance to an herb known all too well to Socrates (poison hemlock). For those that missed my last two videos on the safety of common spices, see Update on Cinnamon for Blood Sugar Control and Don’t Eat Too Much Nutmeg. This new tarragon finding reminds me a bit about the in vitro data raising questions about the safety of avocados (Are Avocados Bad for You?) that thankfully appeared to not translate out in a population study. I’ll keep an eye out for new data and post to the NutritionFacts.org Facebook page if I find anything.

A-334	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/31/nutmeg-toxicity/	Nutmeg Toxicity	The spice nutmeg appears to have a relatively narrow margin of safety. In my research on cinnamon I ran across a peculiar paper entitled “Christmas Gingerbread and Christmas Cheer: Review of the Potential Role of Mood Elevating Amphetamine-like Compounds.” The author suggested that certain natural constituents of spices such as nutmeg may form amphetamine compounds within the body “sufficient to elevate the mood and help provide some added Christmas cheer” during the holiday season. This hypothetical risk was raised as far back as the Sixties in the New England Journal of Medicine in an article called “Nutmeg Intoxication.” The paper pondered whether the age-old custom of adding nutmeg to eggnog arose from the psychopharmacological effects described in cases of nutmeg intoxication. Such cases evidently go back to the 1500s, when it was used as an abortifacient to induce a miscarriage and in the 1960s as a psychotropic drug. Mental health professionals from the ’60s concluded that while nutmeg “is much cheaper for use and probably less dangerous than the habit-forming heroin, it must be stated that it is not free from danger and may cause death.” The toxic dose of nutmeg is two to three teaspoons. I assumed no one would ever come close to that amount unintentionally until I saw report in which a couple ate some pasta, collapsed, and were subsequently hospitalized. It was a big mystery until “On close questioning, the husband revealed that he had accidentally added one third of a 30g spice jar of nutmeg to the meal whilst cooking it.” That’s about 4 teaspoons–I don’t know how they could have eaten it! I imagine the poor wife just trying to be polite. There are also potentially toxic compounds in certain types of cinnamon. See my video Update on Cinnamon for Blood Sugar Control. We can also overdo other healthful plant foods if we consume too much of the yellow curry spice turmeric, drink too much tea, or eat too much soy, too much seaweed, too many broccoli sprouts, and even too many raw cruciferous vegetables.

A-335	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/29/cinnamon-for-diabetes/	Cinnamon for Diabetes	The use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial. We know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one’s blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming two teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test. That’s where they make you drink some sugar water to see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control, and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike. Even a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference. A review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly. So what’s the controversy? Well, as I described in my video The Safer Cinnamon, cassia cinnamon, also known as Chinese cinnamon (probably what you’re getting at the store if it just says “cinnamon”) contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver at high doses. Originally the concern was mainly for kids during Christmas-time where they might get an above average exposure, but more recently some researchers suggest that kids just sprinkling some cassia cinnamon on their oatmeal a few times a week might exceed the recommended safety limit. As you can see in my 5-min video Update on Cinnamon for Blood Sugar Control just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much for little kids, and if they’re eating that cinnamon-sprinkled oatmeal more like every day they can bump up against the limit for adults. So a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone, but can’t we just switch from cassia cinnamon to Ceylon cinnamon and get the benefits without the potential risks? Without the risks, yes, but we’re no longer so sure about the benefits. Nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia. We’ve just assumed that the same would apply for the safer cinnamon, Ceylon, but only recently was it put to the test. That nice blunting of blood sugars we saw in response to cassia cinnamon disappeared when the researchers tried Ceylon cinnamon instead.  In fact, it may actually be the potentially toxic coumarin that was the active ingredient in the cassia cinnamon all along. Thus, sidestepping the toxin by switching may sidestep the benefit. So should we just give up on going out of our way to add cinnamon to our diet? No, I think it’s still a good idea to shoot for a teaspoon a day of Ceylon cinnamon since there are a bunch of other benefits linked to cinnamon besides blood sugar control, not the least of which is it’s potent antioxidant content (as I show in my one of my favorite videos Antioxidants in a Pinch). In my Superfood Bargains video, where I rank foods in terms of antioxidants per unit cost, cinnamon comes out as one of the cheapest food sources of antioxidants, beating out cloves and coming in just under purple cabbage. What about the Oxalates in Cinnamon? Not a problem, but the oxalates in too much turmeric may be a concern. As you’re making a Healthy Pumpkin Pie with all that cinnamon, don’t accidentally add too much nutmeg, though, the subject of my follow-up video Don’t Eat Too Much Nutmeg. Ultimately cinnamon can no longer be considered a safe and effective treatment for diabetes. Either you’re using cassia cinnamon, and it’s effective, but may not be safe, or you’re using Ceylon cinnamon, which is safe, but does not appear effective. Note that even the cassia cinnamon only brought down blood sugars modestly (in other words, only as good as the leading diabetes drug in the world, metformin, sold as Glucophage). So yes, it may work as good as the leading drug, but that’s not saying much. The best way to treat diabetes is to attempt to cure it completely, reversing diabetes with a healthy diet.  Books I would recommend (in order of publication) are Defeating Diabetes, Dr. Neal Barnard’s Program for Reversing Diabetes, and The End of Diabetes. I talk more about the potential potency of plants in general in Power Plants and more about spices in particular in videos such as: Amla Versus Diabetes explores the use of Indian gooseberries as a way to help control blood sugar, though, again, the best way to deal with diabetes is to prevent and treat it with a healthy diet. 	-	antioxidants,blood sugar,cassia cinnamon,Ceylon cinnamon,children’s health,Chinese cinnamon,cinnamon,coumarin,diabetes,Glucophage,glucose tolerance,Indian gooseberries,liver,liver disease,liver health,metformin,nutmeg,oxalates,plant-based diet,toxins,vegan,vegetarian,youth health	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-too-much-nutmeg/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-cinnamon-for-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795757572,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/780000249,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-too-much-nutmeg/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/update-on-cinnamon-for-blood-sugar-control/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&term=cinnamon+intake+lowers+meta,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74649104,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-336	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/24/can-cellulite-be-treated-with-diet/	Diet & Cellulite	Two theories about the build-up of subcutaneous fat, involving the chemical spermine and the hormone adiponectin, suggest a plant-based diet may help with cellulite. Gynoid lipodystrophy, known colloquially as cellulite, is the orange peel-type or cottage cheese-like dimpling of the skin on the thighs and tushes of the majority of women. Since it basically results from excess fat storage, attention has turned to spermine and spermidine as potential culprits, since a study found that rubbing a spermine-trapping molecule on one’s thighs apparently results in a significant drop in thigh volume, circumference, and cellulite scores. Spermine was first discovered in human semen back in the 1600s, but only recently quantified in food. The top sources in the American diet were found to be ground meat and lunch meat such as ham, turkey, bologna and salami; green peas, which are also the primary source of spermidine; and cheese such as American and cheddar. So would eating some cheesey peesey meat casserole make cellulite worse? It’s never been tested, but if it did, that could be one of the mechanisms. The reason the food study was funded by the National Cancer Institute is because of a concern that this whole class of compounds may increase cancer risk. For example, polyamine intake was recently associated with increased risk of colorectal polyps. For more on the adverse health effects associated with the intake of “biogenic amines” (chemical compounds of decay such as spermine and cadaverine) see my videos New Corpse Smell and Carcinogenic Putrescine. The other cellulite theory has to do with the hormone adiponectin. If you biopsy the fat in the gluteal region of women with and without cellulite, there seems to be less adiponectin expression in the cellulitic butt fat, so maybe adiponectin is protective. How do you keep adiponectin levels from dropping? Don’t eat a sausage and egg breakfast, which a study showed can lead to a drop in levels within hours (compared to a vegetarian meal). Additionally, switching to a vegetarian diet appears to increase adiponectin levels 19 percent. A meat-free, egg-free diet of vegetables, grains, beans, fruits, and nuts with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of low fat yogurt a day was compared to the conventional diabetic diet. Though all study participants in both groups were made to eat the same number of calories, the vegetable-heavy group lost more weight, lost more waist, lost more cholesterol, more subQ fat, and more belly fat. The subcutaneous fat is what makes up cellulite, so a plant-based diet could potentially decrease cellulite, but we won’t know for sure until it’s experimentally tested directly.

A-337	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/22/big-food-wants-final-say-over-health-reports/	Industry Influence on Our Dietary Guidelines	The story behind the first U.S. dietary guidelines explains why, to this day, the decades of science supporting a more plant-based diet have yet to fully translate into public policy. George McGovern, who died last year at age 90, was best known for his presidential defeat to Richard Nixon, but he also chaired a committee that released the first dietary guidelines in January 1977. From the press conference of their release: The simple fact is our diets have changed radically in the last 50 years with very harmful effects on our health. These dietary changes represent as great a threat to public health as smoking. The diet of the American people has become increasingly rich –rich in meat and other sources of saturated fat and cholesterol and sugar. Most all of the health problems underlying the leading causes of death in the United States could be modified by improvements in diet…. Ischemic heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension are the diseases that kill us. They are epidemic in our population. We cannot afford to temporize. The public wants some guidance, wants to know the truth, and hopefully today we can lay the cornerstone for the building of better health for all Americans through better nutrition. Dr. Hegsted, a founding member of Harvard’s nutrition department that spoke at the press conference, later recounted in an interview, “The meat, milk and egg producers were very upset.” And they weren’t the only ones. The president of the International Sugar Research Foundation called the report “unfortunate and ill-advised,” all evidently part of an “emotional anti-sucrose [table sugar] tidal wave.”  From the official record: “Simply stated, people like sweet things, and apparently the McGovern Committee believes that people should be deprived of what they like. There is a puritanical streak in certain Americans that leads them to become ‘do-gooders.’” You can see all the quotes in my video The McGovern Report. The president of the Salt Institute felt that there was “definitely” no need for a dietary goal that called for the reduction of salt consumption. In fact, the assertion that “improved nutrition may cut the nation’s health bill by one third” was challenged. He tried to explain that healthcare expenditures increase if the lifespan is prolonged. If people live longer because they eat healthier it could be more expensive. As one researcher pointed out, “If tobacco were banned the increase in the expected lifespan would simultaneously increase the cost of care of old people which comes under the category of healthcare expenditures.” If people eat healthier we might have more old people to take care of! The National Dairy Council likewise recommended the dietary goals be withdrawn and reformulated to have the “endorsement of the food industry.” So as soon as Häagen-Dazs says they’re okay? The two industries that went the most ballistic, though, were the meat and egg producers who demanded additional hearings be held. The president of the American National Cattlemen’s Association described why the industry “reacted rather violently,” complaining that meat is never mentioned in a positive way in the guidelines. The only mentions of meat were those associating meat consumption with various degenerative diseases. “If these dietary goals are moved forward and promoted in the present form…entire sectors of the food industry (meat, dairy, sugar, and others) may be so severely damaged that when it is realized that the dietary guidelines are ill-advised, as surely will be the discovery, recovery may be out of reach.” “Thus guided by my conscience,” said the president of the National Livestock and Meat Board, “I am certain that actions of the animal industries to ensure Americans are properly fed with abundant meat and other animal foods is an honorable and morally correct diet course.” The meat industry recommended the committee withdraw the dietary guidelines and issue a corrected report. They especially didn’t like guideline #2 to decrease meat consumption to lower saturated fat intake. Senator Dole—Kansas Senator Dole— offered to have that amended from decrease consumption of meat to instead “Increase consumption of lean meat.” “Would that taste better to you?” he asked the president of the cattlemen’s association, who replied, “Decrease is a bad word, senator.” By the end of the year, a revised version was released. Guideline #2 was changed to “Choose meats, poultry, and fish which will reduce saturated fat intake.” That wasn’t enough for the meat industry. They wanted the whole committee on nutrition eliminated completely and its functions turned over to the agriculture committee. The New York Times, noting that the Agriculture Committee looks after the producers of food, editorialized that this would be like “sending the chickens off to live with the foxes.” And that’s what happened. The Senate Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs got disbanded. McGovern never gave up the fight, though. When an interviewer confronted him with the Serenity Prayer’s “grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,” McGovern rejected the notion, saying: “I keep trying to change them.” This story of the first dietary guidelines gets at a fundamental issue that I raised previously in another of my favorite videos, The Tomato Effect. If the data are so strong and consistent that a plant-based diet can not only prevent and treat but cure our number one killer (not to mention play a role in helping with 14 of our other top 15 leading causes of death), why isn’t it not only the treatment of choice but also incorporated into the official federal dietary guidelines (as is the case to a small but wildly successful degree in countries like Finland)? 	-	beef,cancer,cholesterol,dairy,degenerative disease,diabetes,dietary guidelines,eggs,fat,fish,George McGovern,Harvard,hypertension,International Sugar Research Foundation,ischemic heart disease,lamb,meat,milk,National Livestock and Meat Board,plant-based diet,poultry,public health,public policy,salt,Salt Institute,saturated fat,sugar,The National Dairy Council,The Senate Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-pushback-from-the-sugar-salt-and-meat-industries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nations-diet-in-crisis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-from-dairies-to-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-mcgovern-report/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-pushback-from-the-sugar-salt-and-meat-industries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nations-diet-in-crisis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-from-dairies-to-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-338	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/17/flaxseeds-breast-cancer-survival/	Flax & Breast Cancer Survival	 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of flaxseeds in breast cancer patients found that flaxseeds appear to have the potential to reduce tumor growth in just a matter of weeks. Scientists believe this is due to a class of phytonutrients known as lignans, which are present in flaxseeds at levels up to 800 times other plant foods. Lignans can be thought of as the Western equivalent of the isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soy foods popular in traditional Asian diets, as they share many purported anti-cancer mechanisms. Since soy food consumption is associated with both preventing breast cancer and prolonging breast cancer survival, one might expect the same to be found for lignans. In Flaxseeds & Breast Cancer Prevention I covered the population-based, in-vitro, and clinical evidence supporting prevention, but what about for women already diagnosed with the dreaded disease? Three studies were recently published that followed a total of thousands of women diagnosed with breast cancer. The first study from New York reported substantially reduced risks of overall mortality and especially breast cancer mortality associated with higher lignan intakes in postmenopausal women. The next population study was out of Italy. At surgery, when the women were getting their primary breast tumors removed, they had some blood drawn; within 5 years those who had lower circulating levels of lignans were significantly more likely to die from their cancer coming back than those with more lignans in their bloodstream. The researchers concluded “Lignans might play an important role in reducing all-cause and cancer-specific mortality of the patients operated on for breast cancer.” The latest and largest study to date was performed in Germany. Postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who had high blood lignan levels appeared to have better survival, and the higher the better. You can see the survival curve in my 3-min video Flaxseeds and Breast Cancer Survival: Epidemiological Evidence. Those who had the most lignans in their blood lived the longest and tended to live the longest disease free. The population data looked so promising that researchers decided to put lignans to the test by feeding women flaxseeds, the most concentrated source of lignans, to see what would happen. One of the ways the chemotherapy drug tamoxifen works is by boosting the levels of angiogenesis inhibitors like endostatin, which is a protein the body makes to try to starve tumors of their blood supply. Using a technique called microdialysis, you can stick a catheter into a woman’s breast and suck out some of the fluid bathing the breast cells. If you give women tamoxifen for 6 weeks, the levels of endostatin within the breast tend to go up, and the same thing happens when you instead add three and a half tablespoons of ground flaxseeds to their daily diet. As you can see in my video Flaxseeds and Breast Cancer Survival: Epidemiological Evidence, the flaxseed doesn’t seem as powerful as the chemo, but the results were so exciting that researchers undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of flaxseeds in breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients were randomized into either the treatment or the placebo group; either a flaxseed-containing muffin or a control placebo muffin every day between the time of their first biopsy and surgery. Researchers then had tumor samples before and after about a month of flaxseeds or no flaxseeds. Those lucky enough to be randomized into the flax group saw, on average, their tumor cell proliferation go down, cancer cell death go up, and their c-erbB2 score go down (a marker of cancer aggressiveness and potential for forming metastases and spreading). The researchers concluded: “Dietary flaxseed has the potential to reduce tumor growth in patients with breast cancer. If the therapeutic index seen in this short-term study can be sustained over a long-term period, flaxseed, which is inexpensive and readily available, may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used breast cancer drugs.” For more on breast cancer survival, see: What about the role of flaxseeds in preventing breast cancer in the first place? See my video Flaxseeds & Breast Cancer Prevention. A study similar to this was also carried out in prostate cancer patients: Flaxseed vs. Prostate Cancer. See Anti-Angiogenesis: Cutting Off Tumor Supply Lines for more on the role diet plays in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels to enable tumors to grow. I also have touched on briefly in Cancer as an Autoimmune Disease and How Tumors Use Meat to Grow: Xeno-Autoantibodies. This is the final installment of my latest video series on flax.

A-339	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/15/flaxseeds-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	Flax & Breast Cancer Prevention	Just a teaspoon of ground flaxseeds a day may help protect against breast cancer. In 1980 a new compound was discovered in human urine. Researchers called it “compound X.” Originally it was thought to be a new human hormone, but it was soon identified as part of a large group of fiber-associated compounds widely distributed in edible plants known as lignans. Vegetarians have about twice the level of lignans circulating within their bodies given their greater intake of plant foods. Since population studies suggested that high intake of lignans reduces breast cancer risk, perhaps lignans are one of the reasons those eating plant-based diets have lower cancer rates. Where are lignans found most in the diet? Seeds, whole grains, vegetables, fruits and berries. Since these are all really healthy foods in their own right, maybe lignan intake is just acting as a surrogate marker for whole plant food intake? (Like the fiber story I detail in Fiber vs. Breast Cancer). Well, in a petri dish lignans do directly suppress the proliferation of breast cancer cells but only after the plant lignans are converted into human lignans by the bacteria in our gut. (More detail in Flax & Fecal Flora). That’s why we want to use antibiotics judiciously. A few days on antibiotics dramatically drops our body’s ability to make these anticancer compounds from the plants that we eat, and it can take weeks for our gut bacteria to recover. That may be why women with urinary tract infections have been found to be at higher risk for breast cancer. Every time they took a course of antibiotics they may have been stymying their good bacteria’s ability to take full advantage of all the plants they were eating. In my 4-min video Flaxseeds & Breast Cancer Prevention I profile the National Cancer Institute study that provides the strongest evidence to date that there might indeed be something special about this class of phytonutrients for breast cancer prevention. They took a bunch of young women at high risk for breast cancer (meaning they had a suspicious breast biopsy showing either atypical hyperplasia or carcinoma in situ, or already had breast cancer in the other breast) and gave them a teaspoon of ground flaxseeds every day for a year before getting a repeat needle biopsy to see if there was any change. Yes, there are lignans in sesame seeds, nuts, whole grains, legumes, certain fruits, and veggies, but they’re most concentrated in flax seeds. They could have instead asked women to eat ten cups of strawberries a day for a year to get the equivalent amount, but they’d probably get better compliance with just a teaspoon of flax :) So what happened by the end of the year? The primary end point was the expression of a proliferation biomarker associated with cancer called ki-67. In 9 of the 45 women it went up, pictured in red in the video, but in the other 80% of the women it went down. And, indeed, on average they found less cellular proliferation in their breast tissue and fewer precancerous changes. For those that don’t like the taste of flaxseeds, sesame seeds are also high in lignans. Even though flaxseeds have significantly more lignans than sesame, you appear to produce about the same amount of lignans from them. This was, however, comparing them whole. When people are fed whole flaxseeds, some may not be chewed up and can pass right through you. So ground flaxseed may be best overall. As I note in the Flaxseeds For Sensitive Skin video, ground flax stays fresh even at room temperature for at least a month. What if you or a loved one has already been diagnosed with breast cancer?

A-340	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/10/flaxseeds-for-sensitive-skin/	Treating Sensitive Skin from the Inside Out	 Instead of treating sensitive skin topically, with lotions and creams, why not treat it from the inside out with diet? About half of the American population says they have sensitive skin, defined loosely as tingling, chafing, burning, itching sensations when exposed to various environmental factors. A similar high prevalence has been reported throughout Japan and Europe, and it appears especially prevalent among women. Often there are no obvious signs, so it was dismissed as a “princess and the pea” phenomenon by the medical community. Now it’s largely recognized as a genuine physiological phenomenon, thought to arise from a breakdown of the skin barrier that allows potentially irritating substances to penetrate the skin and generate an inflammatory reaction. So what can we do about it? In 2011, a paper was published entitled “Supplementation of Flaxseed Oil Diminishes Skin Sensitivity and Improves Skin Barrier Function and Condition.” In a randomized double-blind 12-week study, researchers gave women about a half teaspoon of flaxseed oil a day versus safflower oil as a control. That’s the amount of oil found in about a teaspoon and a half of flax seeds. To measure skin sensitivity they painted an irritant chemical on their forearms, and after three months there was significant decrease in skin reddening in the flax group compared to the safflower group. Their skin ended up significantly better hydrated, had significantly better barrier function, was less rough, less scaly, and was smoother. If you watch my 3-min video Flaxseeds For Sensitive Skin you can actually see the changes in a close-up view of the skin. Their skin looked just as dry and scaly before and after the safflower oil intervention, but significantly improved after flaxseed oil. The best source of flaxseed oil is within the flaxseed itself.  Then you get all the nutrition of the whole food, and it’s cheaper and more stable than the oil. Make sure to grind them up to maximize nutrient absorption. Unlike flaxseed oil, you can bake flaxseeds without destroying the omega 3s, and you can even store ground flaxseed for a month at room temperature without spoilage or oxidation.

A-341	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/08/flaxseeds-for-diabetes/	Flax Seeds for Diabetes	Drug companies hope to capitalize on the fact that the consumption of certain plants appears to lower the risk of diabetes by isolating these plants’ active components for use and sale as pharmacological agents. Though not as profitable, why don’t we just eat the plants themselves? One plant in particular that’s now been tested is flax. We’ve known for 20 years that having ground flax in your stomach can blunt the blood sugar spike from a meal, but it’s never been tested in diabetics–until now. World Health Organization researchers published an open-label study on the effect of flax seed powder supplementation in the management of diabetes. Diabetic subjects took a tablespoon of ground flax seeds every day for a month, and, compared to the control group, experienced a significant drop in fasting blood sugars, triglycerides, and cholesterol, as well as the most important thing, a drop in A1C level. If one’s sugars are already well controlled, though, there may be no additional benefit. How does flax help control blood sugars? Flaxseeds may improve insulin sensitivity in glucose intolerant people. After 12 weeks of flax, researchers found a small but significant drop in insulin resistance, perhaps related to the drop in oxidant stress due to the antioxidant qualities of flaxseeds. The study profiled in my 3-min video Flaxseed vs. Diabetes showing a tablespoon of daily ground flax seeds for a month appears to improve fasting blood sugars, triglycerides, cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c levels in diabetics was a non-blinded, non-randomized small study. If it was some drug they were testing, I’d never prescribe it based on this one study, but this isn’t a drug. It’s just flaxseeds. There are just good side effects, so even if this study was a fluke or fraud, flaxseeds have other benefits. In the worst case scenario the seed would still end up benefiting patients who aren’t quite ready or able to reverse their diabetes completely with a plant-based diet. Flaxseeds are calorically dense, but even adding a half cup of ground flax a day may not lead to weight gain. When 4 tablespoons a day were tested for 3 months the flax group ended up with a slimmer waist than the flaxseed oil or control group. Because of the potential of raw flax seeds to interfere with thyroid function at high doses, though, I would only recommend 2 tablespoons a day. And I would not recommend flaxseed supplementation during pregnancy. The flaxseed study reminds me of the Prunes vs. Metamucil for Constipation one, or any of those talking about various foods that may control blood sugar (Amla Versus Diabetes), weight (Fat Burning Via Flavonoids), cholesterol (Dried Apples Versus Cholesterol), or sexual dysfunction (Watermelon as Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction). Yes, these foods may help, but why not get at the root of the problem and try to reverse the condition altogether with a healthier diet overall? The three best books on reversing type 2 diabetes with diet are Defeating Diabetes, co-authored by my favorite dietician, Brenda Davis, and from two of my medical mentors: Dr. Neal Barnard’s Program To Reverse Diabetes Now and Dr. Joel Fuhrman’s The End of Diabetes. -Michael Greger, M.D. 	-	A1C,antioxidants,blood sugar,cholesterol,diabetes,fasting blood sugars,flax,flax seed powder,flaxseeds,insulin,insulin resistance,oxidant stress,plant-based diet,sexual dysfunction,supplements,triglycerides,vegan,vegetarian,weight gain,weight loss,World Health Organization	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flaxseed-vs-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795757572,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3112403/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prunes-vs-metamucil-vs-vegan-diet,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/85485215,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51264427,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22432725	
A-342	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/03/flaxseeds-for-prostate-cancer/	Flax Seeds for Prostate Cancer	 Why is there such a huge disparity in prostate cancer rates around the world? The incidence of malignant prostate cancer is highest in African Americans, some 30 times greater than in Japanese men, and 120 times greater than in Chinese men. The conventional thinking is that this may be due to the higher intake of animal fat and protein in the Western diet, but it could also be the protective phytoestrogens found in plant foods. There are two major types of phytoestrogens: soy isoflavones and lignans. Researchers have found higher levels of lignans in the prostate fluids of men in countries with relatively low rates of prostate cancer, and in vitro studies show lignans can slow the growth of prostate cancer cells in a Petri dish, so a pilot study was performed on flax seed supplementation in men with prostate cancer. Why flax seeds? Because, while lignans are found throughout the plant kingdom, flax has up to 800 times more lignans than any other food. The research team took a bunch of men with prostate cancer, about a month before they were scheduled for surgery to get their prostates removed, and put them on a relatively low-fat diet with three tablespoons a day of ground flax. Though the scientists were skeptical that they would observe any differences in tumor biology in the diet-treated patients in such a short time span, they found significantly lower cancer proliferation rates, and significantly higher rates of cancer cell death. That was compared to so-called “historical controls,” meaning compared to the kind of growth one typically sees in their situation, not to an actual randomized control group. A few years later, though, a controlled study was published. Researchers enrolled men who recently had their prostates biopsied and were scheduled to have repeat biopsies in six months. Then, they did the same thing as the previous study: they reduced the fat in their diet and put them on ground flax seeds to see if it made their repeat biopsy look any different. These were men with what’s called PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), which is like the prostate equivalent of ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast. That’s why they were getting repeat biopsies–to make sure it wasn’t spreading. There hadn’t been much research on this kind of prostatic hyperplasia, with only four epidemiologic studies reported at the time. They yielded varying findings, with increased risk associated with higher energy, protein, and animal product intake, and decreased risk related to the consumption of alcohol, fruit, and green and yellow vegetables—in sum, a low-fat, plant-based diet, high in phytoestrogens. The researchers wanted to know if that kind of diet could be used to treat it too. Watch my 4-min video Flax Seeds vs. Prostate Cancer to see what they found. Study subjects experienced a significant drop in PSA levels (a biomarker of prostate cell growth), a drop in cholesterol (what one would expect with a lower-fat diet with extra fiber), and most importantly, a significant decrease in the cellular proliferation rate. In fact, in two of the men, their PSA levels dropped so much they didn’t even have to go through with the second biopsy! Slowing the Growth of Cancer is good, but how about Cancer Reversal Through Diet? In other words, if one plant could do that, what about a whole diet full of plants? See my video series that goes from Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay (actually Engineering a Cure) to The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle. For benign prostate gland enlargement see Prostate vs. Plants, and Prostate vs. a Plant-Based Diet (with background in Some Prostates Are Larger than Others). What about for breast cancer? See Breast Cancer Survival and Lignan Intake. More on these wonderful seeds in Flax and Fecal Flora, my smoothies (A Better Breakfast), and the oldie but goodie Just the Flax, Ma’am. What about chia? Find out which is better in Flax Seeds vs. Chia Seeds. Since the dietary intervention involved both reducing fat intake and increasing flax seed consumption, how do we know the flax had anything to do with it? Given the composite nature of the intervention—both a lower fat diet and addition of flax seeds, it was unknown whether the effects could be attributed to flax seed supplementation, a fat-restricted diet, or both factors working together.  To figure that out you’d have to do a study where you split men into four groups: a control group, a flax seed-only group, a lower-fat only group, and then a flax seed and lower-fat group; and that’s exactly what they did.

A-343	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/10/01/why-is-selling-salmonella-tainted-chicken-still-legal/	Why Is Selling Salmonella-Tainted Chicken Legal?	When researchers last year at the Emerging Pathogens Institute ranked foodborne pathogens to figure out which was the worst, Salmonella was number one on their list. Salmonella was ranked the food poisoning bacteria with the greatest public health burden on our country, the leading cause of food poisoning hospitalization, and the number one cause of food-related death. Where do you get it from? In my video Total Recall I talked about the threat of eggs. According to the FDA, 142,000 Americans are sickened every year by eggs contaminated with Salmonella. That’s an egg-borne epidemic every year. But Salmonella in eggs was only ranked the tenth worst pathogen-food combination. Salmonella in poultry ranks even worse, the fourth worst contaminated food in the United States in terms of both cost and quality-adjusted years of life lost.  In terms of getting Salmonella poisoning from various U.S. foods, eating chicken may be eight times riskier than eating eggs. Due to strengthening of food safety regulations under the Clinton administration, the number of Americans poisoned by chicken dropped every year from about 390,000 to 200,000. This was rightly hailed as a significant accomplishment. So now eating chicken only sickens 200,000 people in the U.S. every year. Isn’t that a bit like some toy company boasting that they’ve reduced the amount of lead in their toys and they’re now poisoning 40 percent fewer kids? Hundreds of thousands sickened isn’t exactly something to boast about, and the numbers have since rebounded upwards. Since the late ’90s human Salmonella cases have increased by 44 percent. The rebound in incidence of Salmonella infection is likely a result of several factors, but one important risk factor singled out is eating chicken, since the proportion of chicken carrying infection has increased.  When people think manure in meat they typically think ground beef, but when you look at E. coli levels there’s fecal matter in about 65 percent of American beef, yet in more than 80 percent in poultry (chicken and turkey). Why have we seen a decrease in the Jack-in-the-box E. coli O157 but not chicken-borne Salmonella? In the last decade or so, E. coli infected beef and children has dropped by about 30 percent. Salmonella, on the other hand, has actually increased over the last 15 years. One reason for the difference is that the O157:H7 was declared an “adulterant,” defined as any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render meat injurious to health. So selling E. coli laden beef is illegal. Why is beef laced with E. coli contaminated fecal matter considered adulterated, but chicken laced with Salmonella contaminated fecal matter okay? Salmonella certainly kills more people than the banned E.coli. It all goes back to a famous case I detail in my video Salmonella in Chicken & Turkey: Deadly But Not Illegal, when the American Public Health Association sued the USDA for putting its stamp of approval on meat contaminated with Salmonella. What could the USDA possibly say in meat’s defense? They pointed out that there have been Salmonella outbreaks linked to dairy and eggs, for example, too, so since “there are numerous sources of contamination which might contribute to the overall problem.” It would be “unjustified to single out the meat industry and ask that the Department require it to identify its raw products as being hazardous to health.” That’s like the tuna industry arguing there’s no need to label cans of tuna with mercury levels because you can also get exposed eating a thermometer. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the meat industry position, arguing you can allow potentially deadly Salmonella in meat because, “American housewives are…normally are not ignorant or stupid and their methods of preparing and cooking of food do not ordinarily result in salmonellosis.” What?! That’s like saying oh, minivans don’t need seatbelts because soccer moms don’t ordinarily crash into things. I’ve talked about this travesty before in my blog post Why is it Legal to Sell Unsafe Meat? and video Unsafe at Any Feed. Don’t worry, though, the meat industry is on it! See my videos Viral Meat Spray and Maggot Meat Spray (if you dare! :) My video Food Poisoning Bacteria Cross-Contamination explains that raw meat can be dangerous no matter how long you cook it and Fecal Bacteria Survey features an industry trade journal explaining the difference between the attitude in Europe and The United States. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has petitioned the USDA to bar the sale of Salmonella-contaminated meat, but so far to no avail. 	-	adulterant,adulterated,American Public Health Association,bacteria,beef,cheese,chicken,contamination,dairy,e. coli,eggs,fecal contamination,fish,food poisoning,foodborne pathogens,maggots,meat,milk,pathogens,poultry,public health,salmonella,U.S. Food and Drug Association,viruses,yogurt	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/23/why-is-unsafe-meat-legal/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/23/why-is-unsafe-meat-legal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22980012,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray,http://cspinet.org/new/pdf/cspi_petition_to_usda_on_abr_salmonella.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/salmonella-in-chicken-turkey-deadly-but-not-illegal/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/

Order on my website or through Amazon (all proceeds go to the 501c3 nonprofit charity that keeps NutritionFacts.org up and running). It can also now be ordered as a video download. The current batch of videos from volume 14 on NutritionFacts.org is set to run out soon, so starting this month and running through November I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 15. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works–more than 30 hours of video(!)–I have a special on my complete DVD collection. Here’s the list of chapters from the new volume 15 DVD — a preview of what’s to come over the next few months here on NutritionFacts.org: As usual, I’m honored to feature some of the most groundbreaking research (as in BRCA Breast Cancer Genes and Soy and Treating Multiple Sclerosis With Diet) and practical tips (Canned Beans or Cooked Beans? and How to Avoid Phosphate Additives–hint: they’re often not labeled) along with some mythbusting (BOLD Indeed: Beef Lowers Cholesterol? and Alkaline Diets, Animal Protein, and Calcium Loss) and life-changers (Cavities and Coronaries: Our Choice and Ending the Heart Disease Epidemic) thrown in for good measure. And of course there are the fun ones (with a name like Testing Your Diet with Pee & Purple Cabbage you know it’s got to be good!). Order at DrGreger.org/DVDs or through Amazon. All the money from DVD sales goes to keep NutritionFacts.org alive and kicking. Because NutritionFacts.org’s financial situation remains precarious, the price of new DVDs has been raised to $25. However, you can still get the new DVD for $20 as a video download. That way you can watch these two hours of new material instantly rather than waiting on snail mail. To encourage everyone to become a regular supporter, anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both–your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs. I have been writing, researching, and speaking about nutrition for more than a decade. In that time, every penny I received from the sales of all my books went to charity, as did every penny from the sales of every DVD and every penny from every speaking engagement. In retrospect, instead of giving the money away, maybe I should have saved it so that should I ever start a website to give all my work away for free, I’d have enough to keep it going! 	-	DVD	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/11/new-dvd-on-the-latest-in-nutrition-all-proceeds-to-charity/	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/11/new-dvd-on-the-latest-in-nutrition-all-proceeds-to-charity/,http://smile.amazon.com/Latest-Clinical-Nutrition-Michael-Greger/dp/B00F6WQTUC/ref=pd_sim_mov_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=1DZQBP9N6XJNG2XJE9YV&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20,http://www.DrGreger.org/dates.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/,http://www.drgreger.org/downloads,http://www.amazon.com/gp/node/index.html/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&me=A1QZTUS5K8MU75&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20,http://www.drgreger.org/DVDs,http://www.drgreger.org/writings.html	
A-345	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/24/raisins-vs-energy-gels-for-athletic-performance/	Raisins vs. Energy Gels for Athletic Performance	After about an hour of strenuous exercise, long-distance athletes can really start to deplete their glycogen stores, the body’s source of quick energy. Studies dating back to the ’30s found that by hooking athletes on a treadmill up to an IV drip of sugar water, you could delay fatigue, and that drinking sugar water could help as well.  So the sports supplement industry has come up with an array of energy shots, gels, bars, and chews—even sports jelly beans, used (what a coincidence) by the Jelly Belly Cycling Team. In fact the Jelly Belly Candy Company paid for a study that found that said jellybeans could shave 4 or 5 seconds off of a 10km cycling trial compared to sports drinks or gels. But what about compared to a natural, nutrient-rich source of energy such as raisins? As I explain in my 3-min video Raisins vs. Jelly Beans for Athletic Performance, athletes are so heavily marketed to that they may be left with the impression that specially designed supplements are essential for optimal performance. Yet cheaper, healthier alternatives may be overlooked. A research team at Louisiana State University tested low-cost, natural food products rich in carbs such as sun-dried raisins to see if they had the potential to improve performance to a similar degree. Raisins are described as a nutritious, convenient, palatable, cost-effective source of concentrated carbohydrates. But do they work as well? The researchers found they work just as well. Trained cyclists and triathletes put raisins to the test against sports jelly beans and arrived at the same competitive times and achieved the same power output. San Diego State University researchers stacked raisins up against commercial sports gels and arrived at the same conclusion: same respiratory exchange, carb and fat oxidation, and energy expenditure. In fact the only significant difference was in “hedonic scores.” In scoring the pleasantness of the contenders, raisins beat out the jelly beans. Compared to jelly beans with flavors like “extreme watermelon” there was a greater preference for just plain raisin-flavored raisins. Beans, Beans, Good for Your Heart—but only the non-jelly variety! Other sports supplements may be worse than just a waste of money. See, for example my videos Heterocyclic Amines in Eggs, Cheese, and Creatine? and Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. Compare the antioxidant content of raisins to other dried fruits in my videos Dried Apples Versus Cholesterol and Better Than Goji Berries.

A-346	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/19/choosing-the-best-nutrition-bar/	The Best Nutrition Bar	There are a variety of healthier fruit and nut bars on the market now that boast dried fruit as a primary ingredient. Dried fruit is calorically dense, though. Should we be concerned that eating such bars may make us fat? You may have noticed in the conclusion of the fig study I covered in Best Dried Fruit for Cholesterol that adding 14 figs to people’s daily diets did not lead to significant weight gain. Wait a second. That’s 300 calories of figs a day. Over 5 weeks that’s 10,000 calories. How did 10,000 calories disappear into thin air? Figs are so satiating and packed with fiber that even without trying people just end up eating less of other foods throughout the day. I get full just thinking about eating 14 figs! Was that study just a fluke? Let’s look at the other new studies I covered. What about adding three quarters of a cup of dried apples to our diet every day for a year? Two hundred extra calories a day, but no significant change in weight. Two hundred extra calories of prunes a day for a year? No significant change in weight and same thing with a month of a daily 300 calorie load of dates. In general, the 5-10% of Americans that average a tablespoon or more of dried fruit a day tend to be less overweight, less obese, and have a slimmer waist with less abdominal obesity. They tended to eat more, but weighed less.  Similar findings were found for those that eat nuts and nut butters, lower body mass index, slimmer waist, and significantly less excess weight and obesity. See my video Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence. The various mechanisms are summarized in Solving the Mystery of the Missing Calories and explored further in a four-video series: What if you put dried fruit and nuts together? What would be the effect of adding daily fruit and nut bars on top of one’s regular diet for two months? Researchers took about a hundred folks who were overweight and randomized them into two groups. Half ate their regular diet, and the other half ate their regular diet plus two fruit and nut bars a day, totaling an extra 340 calories. But these weren’t candy calories; these were largely whole plant food calories, dried fruits and nuts. Two daily fruit and nut bars for two months did not cause weight gain. And they had additional sugar in them (they were KIND brand bars). Maybe that may be why the participants’ cholesterol didn’t get better despite the nuts, which should have helped. I highlight some brands in my 3-min video Do Fruit & Nut Bars Cause Weight Gain? with no added sugar, but it’s even cheaper to just concoct one’s own trail mix and eat dried fruits and nuts on their own. 	-	abdominal obesity,almond butter,caloric density,cholesterol,dried apples,dried fruit,figs,fruit,nut bar,nut butter,nutrition bar,nuts,obesity,peanut butter,satiety,weight gain,weight loss	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/12/best-dried-fruit-for-cholesterol/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-fruit-nut-bars-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-fruit-nut-bars-cause-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/12/best-dried-fruit-for-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-347	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/17/prunes-metamucil-or-a-plant-based-diet/	Best Treatment for Constipation	Constipation is a common problem that affects up to 20 percent of the world’s population. Nearly 60 million Americans suffer from chronic constipation, which is particularly a problem in women and the elderly. It is a pathological condition that is often severe enough to disrupt daily activities and derange quality of life. It responds poorly to available medical remedies and may prompt sophisticated and potentially harmful surgical procedures. Despite all this, it is still frequently considered a trivial issue and affected individuals tend to self-medicate either using over-the-counter laxatives or ‘natural’ remedies, none of which had been adequately investigated. Until now. Fiber supplements can be inconvenient, taste nasty, and cause bloating—even choking. Prunes could present a natural, convenient, tasty alternative, but do they work? A randomized clinical trial of prunes vs. Metamucil was recently published. I present the results in my 4-min video Prunes vs. Metamucil vs. Vegan Diet. Each dot on the graph represents a complete spontaneous bowel movement. You’ll notice when you watch the video how many had zero a week. Study participants went from an average of 1.7 a week up to 3.5 on prunes (at least one every other day), then back to baseline when prunes were removed. On Metamucil they got up to 2.8  a week. Not as good as the prunes, and a significantly better stool consistency was also noted when using the prunes, as measured by the famous Bristol Stool Scale. The researchers concluded that treatment with dried plums resulted in a greater improvement in constipation symptoms than the commonly used fiber supplement. Given their palatability, tolerability, and availability, dried plums should be “considered as a first line therapy for chronic constipation.” If that’s what adding one plant can do, though, what if all you ate was plants? Vegans are off the charts, averaging 10.9!

A-348	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/12/best-dried-fruit-for-cholesterol/	Best Dried Fruit for Cholesterol	When I saw there was a paper entitled “Daily Dried Apples Versus Daily Dried Plums: Impact on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Postmenopausal Women,” the first thing I thought was well, was the study funded by the U.S. Apple Association, or the International Prune Association? Turns out neither. Just our taxpayer dollars hard at work. Great! So, what did they find? One hundred and sixty older women were randomly assigned to a dried apple group or a dried plum group and followed for a year. A dozen dried apple rings a day, or about eight prunes. As you can see in my three-minute video, Dried Apples, Dates, Figs, or Prunes for Cholesterol?, within three months, the apple group experienced a significant drop in cholesterol that stayed down throughout the rest of the study, but no cholesterol benefit in the prune group. Both dried fruit regimens lowered C-reactive protein levels about the same—though dried plums may cause a quicker decrease in inflammation, whereas dried apples may result in a greater decrease overall. Prunes may not help our cholesterol, but they may improve the health of our skin—see Beauty Is More Than Skin Deep. That’s, of course, in addition to their customary regularity role—something I address in Prunes vs. Metamucil vs. Vegan Diet. Twelve apple rings is equivalent to eating about two apples a day. They think that the cholesterol-lowering properties of apples may be due to their unique pectin fiber composition, which may increase fecal excretion of bile. Or, there may be cholesterol-lowering phytonutrients unique to the apples. Either way, this supports the extraordinary findings detailed in my previous video, Dried Apples Versus Cholesterol. What about dried figs? The California Fig Board did not want to be left out. They put people on 14 figs a day (that’s a lot of figs!) for five weeks, and…nothing. Daily consumption of figs did not appear to reduce bad (LDL) cholesterol. Finally, what about dates? Another recent study tested four or five dates a day, for a month, and again nothing. The dates did tend to bring down triglyceride levels, though, which is surprising, given their sugar content. Studies of the glycemic index of dates found them to have a surprisingly mild effect on blood sugar levels. In Dried Apples, Dates, Figs or Prunes for Cholesterol?, I show graphs comparing the blood sugar effects of straight sugar water, versus that same amount of sugar in date form. More on the sugar content of dates in Are Dates Good For You?; a recipe in Healthy Pumpkin Pie; and my favorite source for dates here (the season just started!). Dates beat out other common fruits in terms of containing more vitamins and minerals. They’ve even been touted as the “richest source of dietary minerals,” but, because they’re dried, they have about five times more calories than fresh fruits.

A-349	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/10/eggs-vs-cigarettes-in-atherosclerosis/	Eggs, Cigarettes, and Atherosclerosis	A study in the journal Atherosclerosis found that eating just 3 eggs or more a week was associated with a significant increase in artery-clogging plaque buildup in people’s carotid arteries going to their brain, a strong predictor of stroke, heart attack, and death.  If you check out my 3-min video Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis you’ll see they found an exponential increase in arterial plaque buildup for smokers and egg-eaters. Those that ate the most eggs had as much as two-thirds the risk of those that smoked the most, the equivalent of a pack-a-day habit for 40 years or more. This did not go over easy with the egg industry. As revealed in a series of internal memos about this group of researchers retrieved through the Freedom of Information Act, the American Egg Board discussed the “wisdom of making industry responses when the public knows there is a vested interest…” So the Executive Director of the Egg Board’s “Egg Nutrition Center” proposed they contact “some of our ‘friends’ in the science community” to have an “objective, external source author the response.” “If you do so,” the Egg Board wrote to one of their “friends” at Yale, “we’ll certainly compensate you…” But the prominent Yale physician refused to “participate in an overtly antagonistic letter” given his friendship with one of the co-authors of the eggs and atherosclerosis review. If you can’t find someone with credentials to counter the science, why not just make one up? Check out Eggs vs. Cigarettes in Atherosclerosis to see this story’s bizarre twist involving an attempt to discredit the egg & smoking study with a hacked email account. This is the same prestigious research team that wrote the landmark review upon which I based my videos Egg Cholesterol in the Diet and Avoiding Cholesterol Is a No Brainer.

A-350	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/05/latest-science-on-rooibos-nettle-tea/	Rooibos & Nettle Tea	Rooibos, or red tea, is anecdotally reported to aid stress-related symptoms, but it has none of the mood-altering phytonutrients thought responsible for the increased calm and decreased stress after drinking green tea (see Dietary Brain Wave Alteration). So why do some people feel less stressed drinking red tea? Researchers recently found that human adrenal gland cells in a petri dish produce about 4 times less steroid hormones in the presence of red tea. This could certainly result in lower stress hormone levels if it happened within the body, but the effect was so dramatic the researchers were concerned it might adversely effect the production of sex steroid hormones as well. Thankfully, that’s not what they found when they tested it in human subjects. The same, however, may not be true of nettle tea. Nettle is used to relieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement by boosting estrogen levels, but case reports show men drinking too much may grow breasts and women may actually start lactating. Nettle tea is safe as long as you 1) don’t drink too much, 2) don’t mistake it for deadly nightshade if you forage it, and 3) don’t put the leaves in your mouth fresh–they don’t call them stinging nettles for nothing! In my 3-min video Herbal Tea Update: Rooibos & Nettle I show a close-up of the impalement of a nettle spicule in the skin. My go-to herbal tea is hibiscus (see my last article Hibiscus Tea: The Best Beverage?). But nettle tea is touted for being packed with minerals. That always seemed a bit strange to me. Yes, if you boil dark green leafy vegetables long enough, you do lose minerals into the cooking water, but how many minerals could we be getting if you just steep some tea? We never knew because it hadn’t been tested, until now. Researchers compared the mineral content of nettle tea to chamomile tea, mint tea, St. John’s Wort, and sage. If you watch the video you’ll see that nettle tea didn’t seem to have much more than any of the others, but maybe they’re all really high? One cup of nettle tea has the same amount of iron as dried apricot, the zinc found in a single pumpkin seed, one-twentieth of a mushroom’s worth of copper, and 4 peanuts’ worth of magnesium and a fig’s worth of calcium. I agree with the researchers that a cup of herbal tea may not be an important source of minerals, but it’s not negligible. Greens are so packed with nutrition that we can benefit by just drinking some hot water they’ve been soaking in for a few minutes. The fact that so much nutrition leaches into the water in nettle tea is a reason we don’t want to boil greens unless we’re making soup or otherwise consuming the cooking water. See Best Cooking Method for more tips on preserving nutrients. 	-	calcium,chamomile tea,copper,estrogen,Green tea,hibiscus,iron,magnesium,minerals,mint tea,nettle tea,phytonutrients,prostate enlargement,red tea,rooibos,sage,St. John’s Wort,steroid hormones,steroids,zinc	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/herbal-tea-update-rooibos-nettle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/03/hibiscus-tea-the-best-beverage,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-351	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/09/03/hibiscus-tea-the-best-beverage/	Hibiscus Tea: The Best Beverage?	A landmark investigation of the Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods put all previous rankings to shame. That’s where I got the data to create my videos Best Berries, which compares hundreds of berries to common fruits, and Better Than Goji Berries, which highlights the dried fruit most packed with anti-aging, anti-cancer antioxidants. Antioxidants in a Pinch and A Better Breakfast can help one visualize the effects of adding just tiny amounts of antioxidant-packed foods to our daily diets. The international team of researchers also compared hundreds of different beverages. They tested everything from Red Bull to crowberry liqueur. I could never imagine any beverage more antioxidant-packed than matcha, which is a drink made out of powdered green tea leaves (so you’re actually eating green tea). But as I showed in Better Than Green Tea?, matcha may have met its match. Hibiscus tea, made from the dried petals of hibiscus flowers, topped the rankings. It’s known as flor de Jamaica in Mexico, sorrel in the Caribbean, and roselle in many parts of the world. It’s what gives the “zing” to red zinger tea. My family’s recipe is to soak a handful of bulk dried organic hibiscus flowers overnight and then blend with a knuckle of fresh ginger, a teaspoon of amla, three tablespoons of erythritol, and a handful of fresh mint leaves to make the half-gallon we drink throughout the day. By blending in the mint, you’re adding dark green leafies to what may be the highest antioxidant beverage in the world, and it tastes like fruit punch! Your kids will love it. You can overdo it though. The impressive manganese content of hibiscus tea may exceed recommended limits at high intakes, though, so we probably shouldn’t drink more than a quart a day (for someone that weighs about 150 pounds; a kid weighing 75 pounds wouldn’t want to regularly drink more than 2 cups a day). Just because something has antioxidant power in the test tube, though, doesn’t mean it has antioxidant flower power in the body. Maybe the phytonutrients aren’t even absorbed. A human investigation of hibiscus tea has finally been published, though. If you take people and have them drink only water for 10 hours the antioxidant level of their bloodstream drops throughout the day. The antioxidants we’ve accumulated eating healthy foods get slowly used up throughout the day fighting off all those free radicals unless we replenish our antioxidant stores. For a primer on the fluctuating levels of oxidant stress, see Antioxidant Level Dynamics. It’s hard to get people to fast for 10 hours, though. So, in addition to water, researchers gave the study subjects something they knew wouldn’t mess up their antioxidant measurements: white bread and cheese. What if at the beginning of the experiment you instead gave people a single cup of hibiscus tea? As you can see in my 2-min Herbal Tea Update: Hibiscus, within an hour there’s a nice spike in the antioxidant level in the blood stream. The effect disappears, however, unless you sip hibiscus throughout the day (or eat something other than Wonderbread cheese sandwiches). Where are antioxidants concentrated the most? Whole plant foods. See the remarkable contrast in Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. What’s so great about antioxidants? See The Power of NO and Mitochondrial Theory of Aging. How do we know more is necessarily better? See, for example, Anti-Inflammatory Antioxidants. For more flower power, check out what the saffron crocus can do against depression (Saffron vs. Prozac), PMS (Saffron for the Treatment of PMS), stress (Wake Up and Smell the Saffron), and dementia (Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s). There are also chamomile flowers (Red Tea, Honeybush, & Chamomile), though Chamomile Tea May Not Be Safe During Pregnancy, and the rose bush: Dietary Osteoarthritis Treatment. More comparisons of herbal teas here: The Healthiest Herbal Tea. I should note that there are unique phytonutrients found in the tea plant missing from all herbal teas, so one would not expect Dietary Brain Wave Alteration from drinking hibiscus.

A-352	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/29/treating-parkinsons-disease-with-diet/	Treating Parkinson’s Disease With Diet	Caffeine consumption appears to help prevent Parkinson’s, but what if you already have the condition? A recent study found that giving folks the equivalent of about two cups of coffee a day worth of caffeine significantly improved symptoms of the disease. Of course, there’s only so much you can charge for coffee, so drug companies took caffeine and added a few side groups so they could patent it into new drugs (Preladenant and Istradefylline). These drugs appear to work no better than plain caffeine, which is dramatically cheaper and probably safer. You can see more of the risks and benefits of coffee and caffeine in Coffee and Cancer and What About the Caffeine? Similarly, certain plants, such as berries, and plant-based diets in general may help prevent Parkinson’s. See my last post Avoiding Dairy to Prevent Parkinson’s. This may be partially because of pollutants that magnify up the food chain into the meat and dairy supply, but it could also be from the protective phytonutrients in healthy plant foods. For example, as you can see in my 3-min video Treating Parkinson’s Disease With Diet, I profile a case report in which a dietician struck with Parkinson’s was able to successfully clear most of her symptoms with a plant-based diet rich in strawberries, whole wheat, and brown rice. These are rich sources of two particular phytonutrients, N-hexacosanol and fisetin, but there hadn’t been a formal interventional trial published, until now. At its root, Parkinson’s is a dopamine deficiency disease due to a die-off of dopamine-generating cells in the brain. These cells make dopamine from L-dopa derived from an amino acid in our diet. Just like we saw with the serotonin story I described in my three-part series The Wrong Way to Boost Serotonin, A Better Way to Boost Serotonin, and The Best Way to Boost Serotonin, the consumption of animal products blocks the transport of L-dopa into the brain, crowding it out.  With this knowledge, researchers first tried what’s called a “protein redistribution diet.” This is where people could only eat meat for supper so the patients would hopefully be sleeping by the time the negative effects of the animal protein hit. The researchers didn’t consider cutting out all animal products altogether until it was discovered that fiber consumption naturally boosts L-dopa levels. Thus, a plant-based diet would be expected to raise levodopa bioavailability and bring some advantages in the management of the disease through two mechanisms: reduced animal protein intake and an increased fiber intake. That’s why plant protein is superior, because that’s where fiber is found. So researchers put folks on a strictly vegan diet, saving beans for the end of the day, and indeed found a significant improvement in symptoms.

A-353	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/27/want-to-help-prevent-parkinsons-disease-avoid-this/	Avoiding Dairy to Prevent Parkinson's	There are four things that may reduce our risk of developing Parkinson’s disease: increase exercise, and avoid dairy products, pesticides, and head trauma (please  wear your seatbelt and bike helmet!). What about avoiding pesticides and other industrial pollutants? A recent autopsy study found higher levels in the brains of Parkinson’s victims of certain PCBs found in Monsanto’s Aroclor, which was banned in 1979. The more PCBs found in the brain, the worse the brain damage. The worst three appeared to be PCBs 138, 153, and 180, all of which are significantly lower in the bodies of those eating plant-based diets (see Industrial Pollutants in Vegans). So, does a vegan diet reduce the risk of Parkinson’s disease? If you watch my 3-min video Preventing Parkinson’s Disease With Diet you’ll see that every prospective study looking at dairy products and Parkinson’s disease found an increased risk associated with consumption. This may be because dairy products in the United States are contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals. Autopsy studies consistently find higher levels of pollutants in the brains of Parkinson’s disease patients, and some of these toxins are present at low levels in dairy products. Tetrahydroisoquinoline is one such parkinsonism-related toxin found predominantly in cheese. Although the amounts of this neurotoxin—even in cheese—are not very high, the concern is that the chemical may accumulate in the brain over long periods of consumption resulting in the brain damage associated with Parkinson’s diease. I also touch on Parkinson’s in: Avoiding dairy may have other benefits. See, for example: What if it’s too late and you or a friend or family member already have Parkinson’s?

A-354	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/22/the-science-on-acai-berries/	The Science on Açaí Berries	An independent review of the effects of açaí berries was recently published, which included studies on immune function, arthritis, and metabolic parameters. The “Evidence-Based Systematic Review of Acai” was issued by the Natural Standards Research Collaboration (NSRC), an impartial scientific body that refuses to take support from product manufacturers. They are cited by the World Health Organization as one of the most authoritative sources on such matters. What did the NSRC find? Whenever a new purported superfood hits the market, the first thing researchers tend to look at its chemistry such as antioxidant capacity, which was done back in 2006. Based on one measure of antioxidants, it had “the highest of any food reported to date,” — a remarkable finding I reported at the time in my video Antioxidant Content of 300 Foods. I’ve since unveiled Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods, and while açaí’s title has been stripped, it’s still high in the list. Despite its cost, as I noted in Superfood Bargains, frozen açaí pulp represents one of the best antioxidant bangs for our buck. We still didn’t know what it did outside of a test tube, though. The next step is to go from test tube to petri dish and try it out on some human cells. They dripped the concentration of açaí berry phytonutrients expected in one’s bloodstream after consumption on some cancer cells taken from a 36-year-old woman with leukemia. They saw a dramatic rise in cancer cell mortality–about twice that found previously using similar concentrations of hibiscus tea on the same cancer. Açaí was also found to boost immune cell function at extremely low doses. If you watch my 5-min video Clinical Studies on Acai Berries you can see actual footage of a human white blood cell gobbling up some invading yeast cells. Sprinkle some açaí berry powder on them and they gobble more. With no açaí for breakfast, white blood cells were able to engulf about 140 yeast, but in the presence of tiny amounts of açaí they engulfed closer to 200. Slowly but surely researchers began piecing together the mechanism by which açaí affected cellular function. Still, no human studies had yet appeared. Researchers moved from cells to animal models. Who can forget the paper “Addition of Açaí to Cigarettes has a Protective Effect Against Emphysema in Mice” from my video Treating COPD With Diet? Instead of adding berries to their cigarettes, though, maybe mice shouldn’t be smoking. Then, finally, starting in 2011, studies on actual people. The first paper, “Pain Reduction and Improvement in Range of Motion After Daily Consumption of an Açaí,” studied about a dozen folks with painful conditions like osteoarthritis.  After 3 months, antioxidant levels went up, and pain levels went down. However, since there was no blinded control group drinking some kind of artificially açaí-flavored Kool-Aid, placebo effects cannot be excluded. The only other clinical study investigated the effects of açaí berries on metabolic parameters. Ten overweight folks were given two packs of frozen açaí pulp every day for a month. Even though they were allowed to take it with sugar, their fasting blood sugars dropped, as well as their insulin levels and cholesterol. It appeared to significantly blunt the sugar spike caused by a standardized meal–all without any obvious adverse effects. In fact the only theoretical concern cited in the NSRC review was that it may work too well. If you’re on diabetic blood sugar lowering medications it could potentially drop your blood sugar too low, or if you have an autoimmune disease or are on immunosuppressants it could stimulate your immune system too much. Caution: there was a case report of a guy whose muscles started dissolving after using an açaí berry supplement. But it turns out there were no açaí berries in it at all! That’s the problem with taking supplements; the industry is so poorly regulated you never know what you’re getting. A study was done on 27 supplements of another purported superfruit, pomegranate.  Of the 27 tested only 5 appeared to be what the labels actually said. Fine, you say, no pills—you’ll just stick to the juice. Another study looked at 45 commercial pomegranate juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States.  They each said 100% pomegranate juice on the label, but most of them lied. Only 6 out of 23 were what they said they were. The only source where you can be guaranteed to get authentic pomegranate juice has no label at all—the fruit itself! I also have a video about pomegranate juice claims: Is Pomegranate Juice That Wonderful? And what’s true of pomegranate juice is true of other juices (Best Fruit Juice) with one exception (The Fruit Whose Juice Is Healthier). Even if supplements contain what they say, they may not be useful (Dietary Supplement Snake Oil) and sometimes it’s what’s added rather than what’s missing that’s the problem (Some Ayurvedic Medicine Worse Than Lead Paint Exposure).

A-355	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/20/the-first-nutritionfacts-org-video-to-hit-a-million-views/	NutritionFacts.org Video Hits a Million Views	I’m so excited to share that my newest live presentation, More Than an Apple a Day: Preventing Our Most Common Diseases, has reached over a million views on YouTube, breaking my previous record for last year’s Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death. If you have not yet shared my new video with everyone you know (and even a few people you don’t! :) please do. If they find it useful, tell them they can subscribe to NutritionFacts.org for free and receive emails daily, weekly, or monthly highlighting all the new content. New content like yesterday’s video-of-the-day, Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death, one of the topics I cover in the live video. If you have already shared it–thanks a million! If you’d like to hand out copies of the new talk on DVD, I continue to offer a five for $40 special (all proceeds go to the nonprofit organization that keeps NutritionFacts.org afloat). Normally, going “viral” is not something a doctor wants to see, but in this case I’ll take it! In other NF news, I’ve just completed my annual review of the medical and scientific nutrition literature. Throughout the year, I collect all the most interesting, practical, and groundbreaking new studies. I accomplish this through PubMed alerts, browsing through every issue of every English-language nutrition journal, and living near the largest medical library in the world. Then I get to scale up this mountain of science in search for hidden treasure. Normally this may mean sifting through a few thousand papers. To my shock, however, as I eagerly pulled up this year’s batch, I discovered that I had chosen and downloaded over 8,000 new articles. There’s no way I can get through all those on my own. We do have a wonderful team of volunteers tirelessly donating hours whenever they can, but I knew such a monumental task would require someone’s full-time attention. So I’m happy to report we’ve hired our first full-time employee (all of my time is donated). To help me handle this next batch of research I’ve brought on Jeff Thomas (welcome Jeff!) on a three-month contract, hoping that end-of-year donations will get us back in the black. Though given this new overhead, mid-year donations would be much appreciated too!

A-356	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/15/why-are-children-starting-puberty-earlier/	Why Are Children Starting Puberty Earlier?	Early onset of puberty is considered a risk factor for a number of diseases in adulthood, including hormone-related cancers, a shorter lifespan, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. The conventional thinking has been that the age of puberty has been getting earlier and earlier because our children have been getting fatter and fatter. However, European kids are also getting heavier, yet there has not been a steady decline in puberty onset (see graphs here). So it may be less about how much kids are eating and more about what they’re eating. The most consistent link between diet and premature puberty has been found to be animal protein consumption. Every gram of daily animal protein intake—that’s just like the weight of a paperclip—has been associated with a 17% increase in the risk of girls starting their periods earlier than age 12. Why this link between animal protein and premature puberty? We know meat increases the level of IGF-1 and that alone is associated with early onset puberty. If you’re not familiar with insulin-like growth factor 1, I have a series of videos about the growth hormone (though mostly in relation to cancer risk). See, for example, The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle and Cancer-Proofing Mutation. The early onset of puberty in girls associated with animal protein consumption may also be due to endocrine disrupting chemical pollutants in the meat supply. Watch my 4-min video Protein, Puberty, and Pollutants.

A-357	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/13/is-titanium-dioxide-in-food-harmful/	Should We Avoid Titanium Dioxide?	Two potential risk factors that may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) are animal protein and nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide. Of all dietary factors, animal protein from meat and fish is most associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease. As you can see in my 6-min video Titanium Dioxide & Inflammatory Bowel Disease, the researchers think it may be the blood in meat which is degraded to carbon monoxide, or some of the toxins created by cooking muscle or added to processed meats, or the pro-inflammatory omega-6  arachidonic acid. Meat may also contain certain bacteria that have been linked to inflammation, but then again maybe it’s the antibiotics in meat mucking with people’s intestinal flora. Whatever the reason, the study concluded that a diet high in animal protein may not only be associated with increased risk of getting inflammatory bowel disease in the first place, but also a higher relapse rate if you already have it. This is consistent with the data I presented last year that even a semi-vegetarian diet was highly effective in preventing flares in Crohn’s disease (see my video Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease). One potential risk factor that I had never heard of, though, was micro- or nanoparticles. Foodstuffs in developed countries contain increasing quantities of microscopic particles such as titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is used by the millions of tons as a whitening or brightening pigment to make white-colored paint, but also as an additive to make white-colored food. It’s added to food so much so that people eating conventional diets may be ingesting a trillion particles of titanium dioxide every day! Who cares, though? Well a few years ago researchers found evidence of micro and nanoparticles in all 18 out of 18 samples of diseased colons they looked at—either colon cancer or inflammatory bowel, but none in the 3 healthy colons they looked at from folks who died in a car accident or from a heart attack. That’s a tiny sample but it got people thinking, and more importantly, inspired scientists to put it to the test. Researchers took intestinal biopsies from people and added some titanium dioxide to see if it would cause inflammation. Watch my video Titanium Dioxide & Inflammatory Bowel Disease to see the results, but basically they concluded that titanium dioxide may transport inflammatory substances like endotoxin into the gut wall via a ‘Trojan horse’-type mechanism. What happens in a petri dish, however, may not happen in a person. How are you going to test the theory in people, though? You can’t go around trying to give people inflammation, but you can take a bunch of people actively suffering from Crohn’s and take microparticles out of their diet to see if they get better.  A study was performed in which of 18 patients with active Crohn’s, 9 were kept on their regular diet and 9 were placed on a low microparticle diet. Within a month, those on the low microparticle diet had a significant decrease in disease severity, and by the end of the study 7 of the 9 were in remission, whereas none were in remission in the regular diet group. In addition to removing things they expected to contain titanium dioxide–coffee whitener, white cheese, powdered sugar–they also removed processed meats and fish, fearing that there were microparticles in them too. This complicates things, though. Just cutting down on meat alone is one of the most powerful Crohn’s interventions, so maybe that’s why they got better and perhaps the titanium dioxide had nothing to do with it. Indeed a larger trial in which both groups were told to cut down on processed meat and seafood found no benefit to also cutting microparticles. This is consistent with another study that did not find that Crohn’s patients were eating significantly more white foods—like crispy shell chewing gums, marshmallows, and powdered doughnuts. So where are we now? Well, high concentrations of dietary microparticles should not be completely ruled out as potential contributors to intestinal inflammation, but there’s little evidence at this point suggesting they’re harmful. Note, though, that the most concentrated sources (out of nearly 100 products tested that I feature in the video) aren’t any good for you anyway, so if you want another excuse to avoid Hostess donuts, there you go! For more on that list of concerning compounds they noted in animal products, see Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens for the heterocyclic amines, Chicken, Eggs, and Inflammation for arachidonic acid, Meat Additives to Diminish Toxicity for heme iron, Yersinia in Pork for the inflammation-linked bacteria, and Lowering Dietary Antibiotic Intake on some of the drugs fed to animals.

A-358	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/08/the-best-way-to-prevent-the-common-cold/	The Best Way to Prevent the Common Cold?	Gargling is one of the best things to do to treat a sore throat. As one of my medical mentors Dr. Klaper instructs: Take a glass of warm water, add a pinch of salt, hold the glass of salt water in your hand, open your mouth, and take a deep breath. Tilt your head back, slide a generous mouthful to the back of your throat, and, with your mouth still open, gently breathe out through the water. Continue until the end of the breath, and then spit it into the sink. Repeat until the full glass of salt water is used. This technique works wonders to soothe a sore throat when you have a cold. But I had never heard of gargling to prevent a cold. Though not popular in the Western world, gargling has been strongly recommended in Japan to prevent upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold. However, there have been no controlled trials, and it remained unresolved as to whether gargling was really effective, until the first study was published in 2005. As you can see in my video Can Gargling Prevent The Common Cold?, they found a significant drop in the incidence of the common cold, suggesting that simple salt water gargling is effective in preventing respiratory infections among healthy people. They concluded: “This virtually cost-free modality would appreciably benefit people both physically and economically around the world.” What do they mean economically? Well most Americans, for example, report about two and a half colds a year. Between medical costs and work absenteeism, we’re talking nearly $40 billion a year. So even if you take into account the 71 seconds it took on average to walk to and from the sink and gargle, and multiply that by the average wage to calculate the “cost of gargling” in wasted time, it’s still considered a cost-effective strategy. This is one of the landmark findings that I’m afraid no one will ever hear about because no one profits (other than all those who don’t get sick!). The latest study was performed to see if it works in kids. A total of nearly 20,000 preschoolers were observed for 20 days, and just like the study in adults, gargling appears to lower the odds of illness by about a third. Gargling with green tea appeared to work even better. Note they speculate that the fact that tap water is chlorinated may have played a role, so gargling with filtered water may be less effective. Also, I would stay away from iodine solutions such as betadine since one can run into the same kind of iodine overload thyroid dysfunction caused by eating too much kelp or thyroid-gland-containing sausages (see my video Too Much Iodine Can Be as Bad as Too Little).

A-359	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/06/which-pets-improve-childrens-health/	Which Pets Improve Children’s Health?	To my surprise, studies of the effects of pets on human health and well-being have actually produced a mishmash of conflicting results. For example, some studies show pets lower your blood pressure—in some cases more than drugs do—but other studies found no effect, or even that pet owners have higher blood pressure! One area where there’s a bit more consistency is children’s health. The presence of pets in the home appears to significantly decrease the risk of infectious diseases in children, including ear infections, respiratory illnesses, and gastroenteritis. But which pets work better–cats or dogs? Find out by watching my 3-min video Are Cats or Dogs More Protective For Children’s Health? (starring members of my furry family!)

A-360	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/08/01/vitamin-d-from-mushrooms-sun-or-supplements/	Vitamin D from Mushrooms, Sun, or Supplements?	Years ago, it was shown that vitamin D isn’t just the sunshine vitamin for us, but for mushrooms as well. You take some mushrooms, put them under a sun lamp for an hour, and they’ll make vitamin D just like we do lounging at the pool. Unfortunately most mushrooms you buy at the store don’t have any vitamin D because they’re grown in the dark, but now there are sun-bathed varieties on the market that boast significant levels. Some mushrooms grown out in the wild have vitamin D as well, but only about 12% of one’s recommended daily allowance per cup. Is the vitamin D in mushrooms bioavailable? In 2008 there was a case report of a dark skinned individual living in England in the winter who–like the other 9 out of 10 South Asians living in the UK–was vitamin D deficient. His physician prescribed a vitamin D supplement, but after doing his own research this patient decided to self-treat. He bought a UV bulb from a local hardware shop and proceeded to shine it directly onto 2 cups of regular mushrooms a day before stir-frying and consuming them. He repeated this on a daily basis for 3 months, and indeed his vitamin D levels shot up and he was cured.  So it’s reasonable to assume that such mushrooms may be able to provide a source of vitamin D for those at risk for deficiency. This was just one person though, so further studies were necessary, and finally those studies have been done. In my 5-min video Is Vitamin D3 Better Than D2? I profile a study entitled Bioavailability of Vitamin D from Ultraviolet Light Irradiated Button Mushrooms in Healthy Adults Deficient in Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D: A Randomized Controlled Trial. The mushrooms were compared to vitamin D supplements and placebo, and both the mushrooms and the supplements were equally effective in raising vitamin D levels compared to the placebo. The type of D made by mushrooms is vitamin D2, which is typically derived from yeast and is the form traditionally prescribed by doctors to cure D deficiency. Most supplements, though, are D3, which is the type found in plants and animals, typically derived from sheep’s wool. Back in 2008 it was established that vitamin D2 was as effective as D3 in maintaining one’s vitamin D levels at standard daily dosing levels. As you can see in the video, whether folks were given D3, D2, or a combo of half D3 and D2, it didn’t seem to matter much in terms of improving vitamin D levels in the bloodstream. But that was 5 years ago–what’s the update? Is vitamin D2 better than vitamin D3? It depends how you take it and what your starting levels are. Watch my video Is Vitamin D3 Better Than D2? for the latest details. Here are my vitamin D recommendations for those in the northern hemisphere: That’s not what the Institute of Medicine says though.

A-361	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/30/is-coconut-oil-good-for-you/	Is Coconut Oil Bad For You?	Some who profit from coconut oil claim it has miraculous powers, curing everything from cancer to jock itch. The boldest claim may be that it is a potential cure for Alzheimer’s, based on a series of anecdotes and one study I profile in my 3-min video Does Coconut Oil Cure Alzheimer’s? Long story short, as the Alzheimer’s Association put it, “there is no scientific evidence that coconut oil helps with Alzheimer’s. The coconut oil promise has been around for more than three years. If the administration of coconut oil was, indeed, beneficial, it would presumably be shouted from every mountaintop.” I don’t find that argument entirely convincing. For example, we’ve known for decades that our leading cause of death is preventable and reversible (see Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped), yet the medical community continues to rely more on drugs and surgery. Why? Well they likely weren’t taught clinical nutrition in medical school (Medical School Nutrition Education), or after medical school (Medical Associations Oppose Bill to Mandate Nutrition Training), and the medical establishment has shown a disturbing inertia even when presented with convincing evidence (The Tomato Effect). The difference is that coconut oil doesn’t have the data to back it up. What’s the potential downside of giving coconut oil a try? I cover that in my 5-min. video Does Coconut Oil Clog Arteries? Unlike other natural remedies, such as the spice saffron that was able to beat out placebo (Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s) and seemed to work as well as a leading drug without the side effects (Saffron Versus Aricept), coconut oil is one of the rare plant sources of saturated fat. Primarily found in animal-derived foods, saturated fat tends to increase LDL (“bad” cholesterol), the leading risk factor for our leading killer, heart disease. So hey, if you want to try it on someone with Alzheimer’s for a few days to see if it makes a difference, fine. I’d try almost anything! But if, as expected, you don’t see an improvement, I would be hesitant to keep anyone on it long-term. Those selling coconut oil say one needn’t worry because coconut oil contains a type of saturated fat that doesn’t raise cholesterol. That’s a page straight out of the beef industry playbook: The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association is always going on about how beef contains a saturated fat called stearic acid.  Unlike the cholesterol-elevating saturated fats (palmitic, myristic, and lauric acids), stearic acid has been shown to have a neutral effect on blood cholesterol. That’s true, and beef does have stearic acid, but it has twice as much of the palmitic and myristic, which they admit does raise cholesterol. That’s like coca cola saying they know for a fact that soda doesn’t make you gain weight because it contains water and water has a neutral effect on weight gain (which they actually did say!). Yeah, but that’s not the only thing in it, and the same with beef, and the same with coconut oil. Watch the video to see the saturated fat breakdown of coconut oil. Years ago I profiled a study that found that cholesterol levels were significantly lower during a coconut oil diet—but only when compared to a butter diet. You know you have a bad product when the only way you can make it look good is to compare it to diets rich in butter. Yes, coconut oil made bad cholesterol go up, but not as bad as butter. But how much is that really saying? (Reminds me of the “compared to pork” study in Nuts and Bolts of Cholesterol Lowering). That was all the science we had for ten years, but four new studies have recently come out: a population study and three clinical trials, all of which I detail in Does Coconut Oil Clog Arteries? The bottom line is that the best available evidence is that coconut oil significantly worsens our bad cholesterol levels. What about those that say the cholesterol-heart disease connection is a myth? Allow me to quote from a medical journal editorial entitled “Cholesterol Myth Club on Par with Flat Earth Society,” which reads “as mixed up as Flat Earth Society members obviously are, at least you can laugh their dumb idea off, and if you want to believe the Earth is flat, this view is not going to cause serious problems like…coronary artery disease.” More in my book Carbophobia, now available free, full-text online. 	-	Alzheimer's,Alzheimer’s Association,atherosclerosis,bad cholesterol,clinical nutrition,clogged artereris,coconut oil,heart disease,LDL,medical community,medical school,saffron,saturated fat,stearic acid	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/saturated-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oils/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-cure-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-bolts-of-cholesterol-lowering/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-versus-aricept/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/	http://atkinsexposed.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2296560,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-versus-aricept/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/quotes.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-coconut-oil-cure-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-bolts-of-cholesterol-lowering/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/	
A-362	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/25/do-vegans-get-more-cavities/	Do Vegans Get More Cavities?	A diet high in saturated fat, which can clog our arteries and lead to inflammation, is  considered a key underlying causal factor for periodontal diseases like gingivitis. This may explain why chronic gum disease is associated with sexual dysfunction. By looking in your mouth your dentist may find out more about you than you realize! We know impotence can be reversed with a more plant-based diet; what about periodontal disease? A new study I feature in my 2-min video Plant-Based Diets: Oral Health found that higher intake of high-fiber foods, especially fruits, may at least slow periodontal disease progression. A healthy diet may also protect the sexual function of women. So what is a safe intake for cholesterol and saturated fat? See my video Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. For oral cancer it’s a no-brainer. According to the latest review in the journal of the American Dental Association highlighted in my video, “Evidence supports a recommendation of a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables as part of a whole-foods, plant-based diet.” The foods found most protective include raw and green/leafy vegetables, tomatoes, citrus, and carrots. Citrus fruits are acidic, though. Fine, less oral cancer, but what about the health of the teeth themselves? Might eating lots of sour fruit erode our enamel? Early case reports that raised red flags involved unusual circumstances like sucking on lemon wedges. See my video Plant-Based Diets: Dental Health for pictures of what happens when you give your preschool child a banana to suck on as a pacifier or juice 18 oranges a day for over a decade (if you dare!). The conventional wisdom has been that fruit juice may be bad for our teeth, but whole fruit is fine. This was challenged recently. The ability of fruits and their juices to erode enamel appears to be similar. For the chart that compares grapes to grape juice, carrots to carrot juice, oranges to orange juice, apples to apple juice, and tomatoes to tomato juice, click here. Now fruits and fruit juices weren’t as bad as soda—Diet Coke takes the title for softening teeth the quickest. But it was a surprise that fruits and their juices had comparable effects. The Dental Association put an interesting spin on it: If eating fruits and vegetables whole has the same demineralizing effect as juice, they argued, then hey, maybe fruit juice is not so bad at all! Of course the glass-half-empty interpretation of fruit being as erosive as juice may be that fruit is worse than we thought for our enamel. Indeed, the latest research on whether the consumption of fruit is cavity-causing found that the frequency of fruit consumption was associated with higher odds of cavities, though they acknowledge that the role of fruit sugars in initiating dental cavities in humans has long been a subject of debate. Those eating plant-based diets may have less disease of the tissues surrounding the teeth, but if people who eat a lot of fruit get more cavities, then what about the health of the teeth themselves? Though vegetarians and vegans don’t have more cavities than those eating more conventional diets, they may have greater signs of acid erosion on their teeth (as documented in two studies I run through in my dental health video). So what should people do? There are a number of foods and drinks that have the potential to cause dental erosion, both unhealthy foods like soda and sour candy, as well as healthy foods like fresh fruit and certain herbal teas. In the biggest study to date, consuming citrus fruits more than twice a day was associated with 37 times greater odds of dental erosion compared to those who consumed citrus fruits less often. It also appears risky to consume apple cider vinegar or sports drinks once a week or more and soft drinks daily. These habits resulted in the odds of erosion being ten, four, and four times greater, respectively, than when the habit did not exist. How can we get the benefits of healthy foods like citrus while minimizing the risks of dental erosion? The most important thing is that we should never brush right after we eat sour fruit. We should wait at least 30 minutes. Acid softens our enamel such that if we brush right away we can actually brush away some of our teeth! I profile a study where they had some folks swish an acidic solution (Diet Sprite) and then brush immediately after, or 10, 20, 30 or 60 minutes after. Drinking soda without brushing at all can lead to some enamel loss, but we may double or triple that damage if we brush our teeth when they’re in the acidified softened state. The researchers suggest we should wait at least 30 minutes and probably a whole hour afterwards to be safe. The simple solution is that after eating anything sour we should rinse our mouth with water to help neutralize the acid. So should we avoid healthy foods like citrus? No! We just need to rinse. What’s so great about citrus? See for example: More on oral health in: Anything else people eating healthy diets should be aware of? The most important consideration is vitamin B12. See my blog posts Vitamin B12: how much, how often? and Vegan B12 deficiency: putting it into perspective. 	-	acid erosion,American Dental Association,apples,beef,carrots,cavities,cheese,chicken,cholesterol,chronic gum disease,citrus,citrus fruit,dairy,dentist,enamel erosion,fiber,fruit,fruit juice,gingivitis,grapes,high-fiber food,impotence,leafy vegetables,meat,oral cancer,oral care,oral disease,oral health,periodontal disease,plant-based diet,raw,saturated fat,sexual dysfunction,soda,tomatoes,vegan,vegetables,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-oral-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/25/vegan-b12-deficiency-putting-it-into-perspective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-dental-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/30/3964/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-363	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/23/meat-fumes-dietary-secondhand-smoke/	Head-Shrinking from Grilling Meat	A year ago I posted a two minute video entitled Carcinogens in the Smell of Frying Bacon, in which I described the ability of the fumes generated by frying meat to mutate DNA. This helped explain both the increased risk of respiratory tract cancer among cooks as well as the lower proportion of deaths from respiratory diseases and lung cancer among vegetarians. If you are going to cook something like bacon and eggs, the barbeque people have the right idea—do it outdoors in the fresh air. Up to 10 times the amount of particles are deposited deep into the lung of individuals cooking indoors compared to outdoors. Pregnant women, newborns, and young children may be at particular risk. In my 4-min video Meat Fumes: Dietary Secondhand Smoke I show that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the vapors released from cooking meat may not only increase the risk of cancer, but also be hazardous for fetal development. Pregnant women exposed to the grilling of meat—even if they don’t eat it—appear to give birth to babies with a weight deficit and a smaller head circumference. Even just living next door to a restaurant preparing meat may pose a hazard. Researchers estimated the excess cancer cases expected among neighbors of various types of restaurants—Chinese, American-style, and barbeque joints. Guess which was type of restaurant was the riskiest? See my video Meat Fumes: Dietary Secondhand Smoke to find out—you may be surprised! How else can we protect our lungs?

A-364	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/18/broccoli-boosts-liver-detox-enzymes/	Broccoli Boosts Liver Detox Enzymes	Researchers just found out that the boost in detoxifying enzymes triggered by cruciferous vegetable consumption may last for weeks! Last spring in my post The Best Detox I described this amazing phenomenon in which a phytonutrient produced by broccoli can enhance the function of our so-called phase II enzyme system that aids in the excretion of foreign molecules. For example if you feed people broccoli and Brussels sprouts, they clear caffeine quicker as you can see in my 3-min video Prolonged Liver Function Enhancement From Broccoli. This means that if you eat a lot of these healthy vegetables you’d actually have to drink more coffee to get the same buzz because your liver is so revved up. What about the carcinogens that I wrote about in my last three posts, Estrogens in Cooked Meat, Avoiding Cooked Meat Carcinogens, and Foods That May Block Cancer Formation? In the studies on Long Island, women that established increased breast cancer risk in those eating grilled meats found that the risk appeared greatest in women with the low fruit and vegetable consumption. Maybe having a side of broccoli can help your body deal with the carcinogen load? Researchers decided to put it to the test. In my video Prolonged Liver Function Enhancement video I detail a study in which subjects were fed cooked meat meals with and without broccoli and Brussels sprouts. In the video you can see how dramatically the levels of these carcinogenic compounds circulating in their bodies drops. Now this wasn’t a surprise; that’s what cruciferous vegetables do—boost our liver’s ability to clear chemicals from our body. What blew the researchers away was the fact that when the veggies were taken away liver function remained enhanced–even two weeks later. So there appears to be a prolonged beneficial effect of cruciferous vegetable consumption. You can eat broccoli days or even weeks before the big barbeque and still retain some protection. Of course if you grill veggie burgers instead it would be a non-issue. Since heterocyclic amines are byproducts of muscle tissue reacting to high heat, you can even deep-fry plant foods and still none of these carcinogens are formed. For more on broccoli’s superpowers see my video Sometimes the Enzyme Myth Is True. You can overdo it, but apparently only at extremely high doses (see Liver Toxicity Due to Broccoli Juice, Overdosing on Greens, and How Much Broccoli Is Too Much?). 	-	breast cancer,broccoli,Brussels sprouts,caffeine,carcinogens,cruciferous vegetables,detox,detoxifying enzymes,enzymes,fruits,heterocyclic amines,liver,liver health,phase II enzyme system,phytonutrients,plant-based diet,vegan,vegetables,vegetarian	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/02/estrogens-in-cooked-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/09/blocking-cancer-formation-green-tea-garlic/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/02/estrogens-in-cooked-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/how-much-broccoli-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/liver-toxicity-due-to-broccoli-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prolonged-liver-function-enhancement-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/09/blocking-cancer-formation-green-tea-garlic/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-365	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/16/dr-gregers-new-annual-year-in-review-presentation/	Dr. Greger's New Year-in-Review Presentation	Watch my new live presentation online at More Than an Apple a Day or order it on DVD (all proceeds to charity). Every year I scour the world’s scholarly literature on clinical nutrition, pulling together what I find to be the most interesting, practical, and groundbreaking science on how to best feed ourselves and our families. I start with the 12,000 or so papers published annually on human nutrition and, thanks to a crack team of volunteers, I’m able to whittle those down to about 3,000 studies, which are downloaded, categorized, read, analyzed, and churned into a few hundred short videos. This allows me to post new videos and articles every day, year-round, to NutritionFacts.org. This certainly makes the site unique. There’s no other science-based source for free daily updates on the latest discoveries in nutrition. The problem is that the amount of information can be overwhelming. Currently I have videos covering 1,664 nutrition topics. Where do you even begin? Many have expressed their appreciation for the breadth of material presented, but asked that I try to condense this body of work into a coherent summary on how best to use diet to prevent and treat chronic disease. I took this feedback to heart and developed Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death, which I’ve been presenting around the country over the past year. Thankfully, Aaron Wissner kindly volunteered to videotape it so now everyone can watch it. Not only did it rise to become one of the Top 10 Most Popular Videos of the Year, it remains my single most viewed video to date, watched by hundreds of thousands of people (NutritionFacts.org is now up to nearly a million hits a month!). Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death explored the role diet may play in preventing, arresting, and even reversing our top 15 killers. Or actually, if you recall, the top 16. Since side effects from prescription drugs kill an estimated 106,000 Americans a year, the sixth leading cause of death may actually be (*gulp*) doctors. And that’s just from adverse drug reactions. Add in medical mistakes (which the U.S. Institute of Medicine estimates kills at least 44,000) and that brings “healthcare” up to our country’s third leading cause of death. Throw in hospital-acquired infections, and we’re talking maybe 187,000 Americans dead every year (and millions injured) by medical care. The best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical and surgical treatments and tests is not to avoid doctors, but to avoid getting sick in the first place. So for my annual presentation this year I thought I’d run through the top dozen reasons people visit their doctors to highlight some of the latest research in hopes of moving me and my colleagues lower down the list of common killers. Thanks again to Aaron, More Than an Apple a Day: Combating Common Diseases is now available online for free (as is all my work). To more easily navigate through the menu of diseases I cover in this new presentation, it is also available on DVD through my website or Amazon.

Order on my website or through Amazon (all proceeds go to keeping NutritionFacts.org up and running). The current batch of videos from volume 13 on NutritionFacts.org are set to run out soon, so starting mid-month and running through September I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 14. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts. However, there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up online free at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the whole (kale-filled) enchilada, I have a special on my complete DVD collection. Here’s the list of chapters from the new volume 14 DVD — a preview of what’s to come on NutritionFacts.org: If it looks appetizing, you can order the new DVD on my website or through Amazon In the last two DVDs I cut the chapter menus so I could pack in more content, but folks missed the ability to navigate around to each individual topic. So although this DVD is only 113 minutes long, the chapter menus are back by popular demand! Fundraising Update At NutritionFacts.org, every day is Independence Day. Independence from advertisers, from sponsors, from paid subscriptions, and from commercial influence. Please help me keep the site free for all, for all time. The DVDs bring in money to help keep NutritionFacts.org afloat. If you’re just going to wait to watch all the videos online individually — great! But please consider making a donation. Hundreds of viewers like you have already stepped up and helped out. Between 2012 end-of-year giving and what I’ve been able to raise so far this year, I have funds sufficient to pay total operating expenses through to mid-September.

A-367	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/09/blocking-cancer-formation-green-tea-garlic/	Foods that May Block Cancer Formation	More than 85% of breast cancers are sporadic and attributable to long-term exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as those in the diet, through a multistep disease process progressing from non-cancerous to pre-cancerous to malignant stages. How can we interrupt this process? The chemical carcinogens formed in chicken, fish and other meats during cooking that I profiled in my last two posts Estrogens in Cooked Meat and Avoiding Cooked Meat Carcinogens are so effective at transforming normal human breast cells into breast cancer cells that researchers have used it as a model of cancer formation to test out various plant-based interventions. Visualize the Jekyll to Hyde breast cancer transformation here. For example, three recent meta-analyses (compilations of individual studies) reviewing all the epidemiological (population-based) evidence concerning green tea consumption and breast cancer risk concluded that green tea consumption may be protective. Well, now researchers can put it to the test. See my 3-min. video Cancer, Interrupted: Green Tea to see what green tea can do to block the transition towards breast cancer caused by the cooked meat carcinogens. More on the chemicals formed by exposing mammal/fish/bird muscles to high temperatures: Any other feats green tea can pull off? See Treating Genital Warts With Green Tea and Treating Gorlin Syndrome With Green Tea. Might white tea work even better? See Antimutagenic Activity of Green Versus White Tea. Any other plants that might be able to smack on the cancer kibosh (besides broccoli of course: DNA Protection from Broccoli and Broccoli Versus Breast Cancer Stem Cells)? What about garlic? Watch my 4-min video Cancer, Interrupted: Garlic & Flavonoids to find out. Should garlic be raw or cooked? See How can I preserve the anti-cancer effects of cooked garlic? I’ve previously profiled garlic in #1 Anticancer Vegetable (make sure to also watch its “prequel” Veggies vs. Cancer).  Other foods that may protect DNA include kiwifruit (Kiwifruit and DNA Repair), cruciferous vegetables (DNA Protection from Broccoli), leafy vegetables (Eating Green to Prevent Cancer), and plants in general (Repairing DNA Damage).

A-368	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/04/avoiding-cooked-meat-carcinogens/	Avoiding Cooked Meat Carcinogens	When the muscles of mammals, fish, or birds are cooked at high temperatures carcinogenic chemicals called heterocyclic amines are created that may increase the risk of breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancer (see my last post Estrogens in Cooked Meat). Risky cooking methods don’t just include barbequing, frying, and grilling. Even just baking chicken at around 350o F for 15 minutes leads to significant production of these cancer-causing compounds. In my video Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens I showed that these cooked meat carcinogens may stimulate breast cancer cell growth nearly as much as pure estrogen. In PhIP: The Three Strikes Breast Carcinogen I showed that these chemicals may promote breast cancer invasiveness even more than estrogen. How do you decrease your exposure to these chemicals? As you can see in my 3-min. video Reducing Cancer Risk in Meateaters, fried bacon and fish are the worst, though skinless chicken breast might lead to the greatest exposure given its popularity.  Those eating out may find my video Fast Food Tested for Carcinogens useful, where chicken items from seven restaurant chains were tested to see which was worse—the answer may surprise you. And if there are carcinogens in roasted chicken, what about roasted coffee? See Carcinogens in Roasted Coffee? and Coffee and Cancer. Women who consume meat very well done, appear to be at nearly 5 times higher risk for breast cancer compared to women who consumed their meats rare or medium done. This, however, raises the so-called “paradox” of preparing meat noted by the Harvard Health Letter. Well-cooked and you risk cancer; undercooked and you risk E. coli food poisoning (a point I also make in Carcinogens in Roasted Chicken?). Eating boiled meat—not broiled, but boiled in water—is probably the safest. Studies show if you eat meat that never goes above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, both your urine and feces damage DNA significantly less than if you eat meat dry cooked at higher temperatures.  A similar study where they compared the excretion of carcinogens formed in processed meats can be found in Prevention Is Better Than Cured Meat. PhIP is also found in cigarette smoke, diesel fumes, and incinerator ash, but because the highest levels in food are found in common meats, toxicologists lament “Exposure to PhIP is difficult to avoid because of its presence in many commonly consumed cooked meats, particularly chicken, beef and fish.”  But if you’re able to somehow dodge those meats (and don’t suck on a cigarette, tailpipe, or incinerator smokestack) maybe it’s not so difficult to avoid after all. The levels of heterocyclic amines flowing through one’s body may drop to zero after refraining from eating meat for just 24 hours. If you practice Meatless Mondays, by Tuesday, morning urine levels of PhIP and MeIQx—one the most potent mutagens ever tested—become undetectable. There are, however, ways even vegetarians may be exposed: cigarette smoke, eggs, cheese, and the popular sports supplement creatine. See my 4-min video Heterocyclic Amines in Eggs, Cheese, and Creatine? for details. Caution may also be necessary with athletic protein supplementation. See Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. In general, Some Dietary Supplements May Be More Than a Waste of Money. Heterocyclic amines are not the only class of meat carcinogens also found in cigarette smoke. See my video When Nitrites Go Bad. While the body can detox itself of both nitrosamines and these cooked meat chemicals within hours or days, some pollutants found in meat can persist in the body.

A-369	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/02/estrogens-in-cooked-meat/	Estrogenic Chemicals in Meat	We’ve known since 1939 that there were “cancer-producing substances” in roasted meat. Scientists have since identified these compounds as heterocyclic amines, described by the National Cancer Institute as “chemicals formed when muscle meat, including beef, pork, fish, and poultry, is cooked using high-temperature methods, such as pan frying or grilling….” As I describe in my 2-min. video Carcinogens in Roasted Chicken, studies on rodents have historically downplayed the risk, suggesting 99% of these chemicals can be removed by the liver. Humans, it turns out, are 50 times less able to detoxify these carcinogens, though. This may explain why studies done on Long Island and around the world have shown women eating more broiled, grilled, fried, barbequed, and smoked meats appear to have up to five times the risk of developing breast cancer (see also Muscle Tremors & Diet and Fast Food Tested for Carcinogens). More than 85% of breast cancers are sporadic and attributable to long-term exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as those in the diet, through a multistep disease process progressing from non-cancerous to premalignant and malignant stages. Most cancer-causing agents are involved in either the initiation stage of cancer, triggering the initial DNA mutation (like radiation), or the promotion stage of cancer, promoting the growth of the tumor (certain hormones like IGF-1). But heterocyclic amines in cooked meat like PhIP are considered “three strikes” carcinogens because they are not only DNA-damaging mutagens and promote cancer growth, but also increase its metastatic potential by increasing tumor invasiveness. Strike 1: By asking women undergoing breast reduction surgery about their meat cooking methods, researchers were able to directly correlate the number of DNA mutations found in breast tissue with the estimated dietary intake of these cooked meat carcinogens. Strike 2: In my 4-min. video Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens I show that not only may these meat chemicals trigger the original cancer-causing mutation, they may also then promote the growth of the tumor. PhIP for example activates estrogen receptors on human breast cancer cells almost as powerfully as pure estrogen. Even at very low doses, the cooked meat chemical PhIP appears to drive the growth of breast cancer. Strike 3: Check out my 3-min video PhIP: The Three Strikes Breast Carcinogen to see what affect these cooked meat carcinogens may have on the invasiveness and metastatic potential of human breast cancer. The growth hormone IGF-1 may also promote tumor progression and invasion (see IGF-1 as One-Stop Cancer Shop). IGF-1 is released by our liver in response to animal protein consumption regardless of how it’s cooked (why? See Higher Quality May Mean Higher Risk.) On the other hand, broccoli and Indian gooseberries may have both anti-proliferative and anti-invasive properties: Lung Cancer Metastases and Broccoli and Amla Versus Cancer Cell Invasion. Most of the experiments on the cancer-causing effects of cooked meat chemicals were done on breast cells in a petri dish, though. How do we know these carcinogens make it not only into the breast after you eat cooked meat, but into the breast ducts where most breast cancers arise—so-called ductal carcinoma.  Researchers didn’t know for sure, until a study out of Canada measured the levels of PhIP in the breast milk formed in those ducts of nonsmoking women. The average concentration of the “three strikes carcinogen” found in the breast milk of meat-eating women corresponded to significant cancer growth activation. One of the women was vegetarian, though, and none was detected in her breast milk. -Michael Greger, M.D. 	-	animal protein,breast cancer,broccoli,cancer,cancer-producing substances,carcinogens,cooked meat,ductal carcinoma,estrogen,heterocyclic amines,IGF-1,Indian gooseberries,meat,metastatic potential,mutagens,National Cancer Institute,PhIP,tumor,tumor growth,“three strikes” carcinogens	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phip-the-three-strikes-breast-carcinogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able,http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v143/n3632/abs/143984a0.html,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phip-the-three-strikes-breast-carcinogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cooked-meats,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	
A-370	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/27/plant-based-diets-for-fibromyalgia/	Plant-Based Diets for Fibromyalgia	Millions suffer from fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by months of widespread pain, often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, headaches, low back pain, and other problems. Its cause is unknown and there is no known cure. In terms of reducing pain and other fibromyalgia symptoms, according to the latest review,  “Vegetarian diets could have some beneficial effects.” Based on what kind of evidence? In my 5-min video Fibromyalgia vs. Vegetarian & Raw Vegan Diets I review the 20 years of science we have so far, in which vegetarian and raw vegan diets were put to the test. Both vegetarian and raw vegan diets led to significant improvements in fibromyalgia symptoms, but what about just mostly vegetarian diets or mostly raw vegan diets? That was the subject of my 4-min. follow-up video Fibromyalgia vs. Mostly Raw & Mostly Vegetarian Diets. How plant-based does one’s diet need to be to effectively treat fibromyalgia? The vegan “Hallelujah diet” appeared to perform the best. When the study was reviewed in the journal Current Rheumatology Reports, the editor noted that it had the most impressive results of any recent fibromyalgia treatment study—three times the improvement that the Mayo Clinic was reporting for their fibromyalgia program. True, it was not a double-blind placebo controlled study, but it’s difficult to design such a study when it comes to diet, since people tend to notice when they’ve been switched to a vegan diet! Raw vegan diets seemed to help; mostly raw vegan diets seemed to help. Eating vegetarian worked; but what about just eating mostly vegetarian? That was the most recent trial. Fourteen fibromyalgia sufferers were  put on a mostly vegetarian Mediterranean diet for two weeks and unfortunately did not see significant improvement.  Maybe the researchers didn’t give it enough time? Other inflammatory conditions have been successfully treated with semi-vegetarian “flexitarian” diets, though, for example, Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease. Cutting down on meat may also help reduce the risk of cataracts (Preventing Cataracts with Diet), obesity (Thousands of Vegans Studied), hypertension (Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death), metabolic syndrome (Metabolic Syndrome and Plant-Based Diets), and diabetes (How to Prevent Diabetes), though there does appear to be a stepwise drop in risk as one’s diet gets more and more centered around plant foods. The bottom line is that the best science to date suggests a plant-based diet in its many forms, may help people with fibromyalgia. Just because it’s the best science we have, though, doesn’t mean it’s necessarily very good science. These were all small, poorly controlled, relatively short-term studies—but what’s the downside to giving it a try? Dietary surveys show that people with chronic widespread pain syndromes tend to eat pretty crappy diets, which helps explain their higher rates of other chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Even if a healthy diet doesn’t help their fibromyalgia symptoms, at least it may prevent them from falling ill with something else. The last thing someone who feels miserable all day needs is another disease. Why do plant-based diets help with chronic pain conditions? There may be a number of reasons why vegetarians only have about half the odds of being on painkiller drugs (see Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants). Potentially inflammatory compounds in animal products include Neu5Gc (The Inflammatory Meat Molecule Neu5Gc), endotoxins (The Exogenous Endotoxin Theory), and animal proteins (Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis). 	-	anxiety,chronic pain,cognitive difficulties,depression,fatigue,fibromyalgia,flexitarian diet,generalized pain,Hallelujah diet,headaches,inflammatory molecule,low back pain,Neu5Gc,pain,painkillers,plant-based diet,potassium,raw vegan,sleep disorders,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-and-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/metabolic-syndrome-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-induced-fibromyalgia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://www.hacres.com/hallelujah-diet,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-mostly-raw-mostly-vegetarian-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-and-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/metabolic-syndrome-and-plant-based-diets/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-induced-fibromyalgia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fibromyalgia-vs-vegetarian-raw-vegan-diets/	
A-371	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/25/apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes/	Apple Peels Turn On Anticancer Genes	A new study calculated that if half the U.S. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables, 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented. At the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases. So by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk, but that’s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption. Even if all we had to eat was the most contaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks. Having said that, why risk any bump at all? That’s one of the reasons I encourage everyone to choose organic whenever one can, but we should never let concern about pesticides lower our fruit and vegetable consumption. Washing fruits and vegetables can decrease pesticide residues (see my video Can Pesticides Be Rinsed Off?), and peeling even more so, but the skin is often where the nutrition is most concentrated. As you can see in my 3-min. video Apple Skin: Peeling Back Cancer, within the last year half a dozen studies have touted the benefits of apple peels. We’ve known the more apples we eat, the lower our apparent risk of several cancers and scientists are just starting to unravel why. In the video I profile a study from the University of Wisconsin, where researchers pitted two lines of human prostate cancer and two of human breast cancer against the peels of organic gala apples. The cancer was not very happy about that (see the before and after here). To figure out the mechanism by which apple peels cleaned cancer’s clock, the researchers measured the effect of apple peels on the tumor suppressor protein maspin inside the cancer cells. Maspin is a tumor suppressor gene that has been shown to have cancer suppressing, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic properties in both breast and prostate cancer cells. The tumor cells found a way to turn this gene off. Amazingly, the apple peels turned it back on. For the first time, the researchers showed an upregulation of this tumor suppression gene as they added more and more of the blended apple peels to each of the cancer types. They concluded that apple peels “possess strong antiproliferative effects against cancer cells, and apple peels should not be discarded from the diet.” If that’s what one plant can do, what might a whole diet full of plant foods do to prostate and breast cancer cell growth? See Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay and The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle, respectively. More on the wonders of apples in Dried Apples Versus Cholesterol and Apples & Breast Cancer. Apple juice, on the other hand, may not be health-promoting for reasons I explained in my last post Uric Acid Caused by Meat and Sugar. See my 3-min video Apple Juice May Be Worse Than Sugar Water to learn more.

A-372	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/20/uric-acid-caused-by-meat-and-sugar/	Uric Acid From Meat & Sugar	Human beings lost the ability to detoxify uric acid millions of years ago. What implications does this have for our health today? Our story starts about 15 million years ago. It was the Miocene epoch. Things seemed to be going pretty good until, it seems, two flaming meteorites smashed into what’s now Germany with an estimated power of a couple million Hiroshimas. As you can see in my 3-min. video Miocene Meteorites and Uric Acid, the crater looks quaint now, but at the time, there was a mass extinction event, wiping many animals out. Thankfully, the common ancestor of human beings and other great apes developed a mutation that may have helped them survive. We lost the ability to detoxify uric acid. Why was that a good thing? Uric acid is naturally produced by the body and may help us hold onto fat, which is good when there’s not a lot of food around thanks to pesky asteroids. Uric acid also helps us retain sodium, which is good if there aren’t a lot of salt shakers out on the savannah, and it also acts chemically as an antioxidant, which is good since green tea hadn’t been invented yet. Fast-forward 15 million years. When salt and calories abound, the last thing we need is more sodium and fat retention. But the antioxidant part we like. Unfortunately, not all antioxidant compounds are necessarily good for us. For example, the preservative chemical BHA works by preventing the oxidation of foods, but is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. Similarly, uric acid is chemically an antioxidant, but when you have too much in your blood it can crystallize in your joints, causing a painful disease called gout. High uric acid levels may also put us at risk for high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, diabetes, and death. So keeping one’s uric acid levels low is an important dietary goal. How do we do that? By avoiding meat and sugar (see my 2-min video Flesh and Fructose). No surprise that the meat and sugar industries both got upset with the latest round of dietary guidance from the federal government. See Dietary Guidelines: Pushback From Sugar, Salt and Meat Industries and Dietary Guidelines: Corporate Guidance. Gout is one of the diseases of royalty that used to only affect the “1%,” the tiny minority eating rich diets. Now we can all dine like kings and queens three times a day and suffer from the same diseases. The “peasant food” choices, the cheapest plant foods, are often the healthiest. See Eating Healthy on the Cheap and Biggest Nutrition Bang For Your Buck.

A-373	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/18/go-nuts-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	Go Nuts for Breast Cancer Prevention	The Black Women’s Health Study I profiled in my last blog Prevent Breast Cancer by Any Greens Necessary was out of Boston University. Across the Charles River, the Harvard Nurse’s Health Study also tried to determine which plants may be particularly protective in reducing breast cancer risk. They looked at intake of fiber and nuts during adolescence and the incidence of fibrocystic breast disease. Fibroadenomas are noncancerous breast lumps, but are considered a marker for increased breast cancer risk. Depending on what lumpectomy biopsies show, benign lumps can indicate anywhere from 30% to 1,300% greater risk of women with fibrocystic breasts going on to develop cancer later in life. Breast cancer can take decades to develop, so the researchers wanted to start early, asking women what their diets were like in high school. We’ve known in adulthood that consuming more fiber is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, and this new research suggests the same when you’re younger. Women who had the most fiber intake during adolescence have a 25% lower risk of developing potentially precancerous breast disease. But there’s fiber in all whole plant foods—fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Did any class of plant foods stick out? Nut consumption was found to be particularly protective. Just two servings a week was associated with a 36% lower risk. That raises the question, though. Which type of nuts? Do peanut butter and jelly sandwiches count or do you have to eat true nuts, like almonds or pecans? See my 3-min video Tree Nuts or Peanuts for Breast Cancer Prevention? to find out. Harvard researchers also found that fiber and nut consumption was associated with a significantly longer lifespan in women. See my 2-min. video What Women Should Eat to Live Longer, one of my top ten most popular videos of 2012. Soy food consumption during adolescence also seems particularly protective. See my 3-min. video Why Do Asian Women Have Less Breast Cancer?. What effect might even just a few days on a diet full of plants have on breast cancer cell growth?

A-374	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/13/prevent-breast-cancer-by-any-greens-necessary/	Prevent Breast Cancer by Any Greens Necessary	Recently a study of 50,000 African-American women was published, a sadly neglected demographic when it comes to nutritional science and, in fact, medical research generally. Certain African populations were among the healthiest on earth, inspiring one of America’s lifestyle medicine pioneers Nathan Pritikin (see my 2-min. video Engineering a Cure). Sadly, African-Americans currently suffer disproportionately from chronic diseases. The good news is that many of the diseases—such as high blood pressure and diabetes—can be prevented, stopped, and even reversed with a healthy plant-based diet. The Black Women’s Health Study investigated fruit and vegetable intake in relation to risk of breast cancer. Those who listened to mom and ate their veggies had a significantly lower risk of the most difficult type of breast cancer to treat (estrogen-receptor negative). Were any plants found particularly protective? Which was associated with lowest breast cancer risk in African-American women? Apples, bananas, broccoli, cabbage, cantaloupe, carrots, collard greens, grapefruit, oranges, spinach, tomatoes, or sweet potatoes? Check out my 3-min. video Preventing Breast Cancer By Any Greens Necessary to find out the answer.

A-375	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/11/why-less-breast-cancer-in-asia/	Why Less Breast Cancer in Asia?	Though breast cancer is the most common cancer among women around the world, the rate in some areas of the world, such as Asia, is up to six-fold lower than in North America. Maybe it’s the green tea and soy? As I show in my 3-min. video Why Do Asian Women Have Less Breast Cancer?, if anything, green tea may only drop risk by about a third. Soy works better, but only, it appears, if you start young. Soy intake throughout the lifecycle is associated with decreased breast cancer risk, but the strongest, most consistent effect is for childhood intake, cutting the risk of later breast cancer by as much as half. If you don’t start consuming soy until your teens or adulthood, though, then soy is only associated with about a 25% drop in breast cancer risk. I have another video on Breast Cancer Survival and Soy, though it may be possible to overdo it. Combined, green tea and soy consumption would only account for maybe for a two-fold difference in breast cancer risk—not 6-fold, so researchers looked into what else Asian women were eating. In my last post Mushrooms For Breast Cancer Prevention I presented evidence that plain, cheap, widely available white mushrooms appear able to outsmart breast cancer cells that try to make their own estrogen. That was based on placental tissue samples, though. Check out my 2-min video Breast Cancer vs. Mushrooms to see mushrooms stacked up against the real thing. Given the intriguing mushroom experiments, researchers asked a thousand breast cancer patients how many mushrooms they ate. Then they asked the same question to a thousand healthy women who they tried to match to the cancer patients as closely as possible—same age, height, weight, exercise, smoking status, etc. Based on those answers they calculated that women who averaged at least a certain daily serving size of mushrooms appeared to drop their odds of getting breast cancer 64%! What was that average serving size? Half of a mushroom a day. Who eats half a mushroom? Well, that was averaged over a month. So compared to women who didn’t regularly eat any mushrooms, those who ate just 15 a month appeared to dramatically lower their risk of breast cancer. Similar protection was found for dried mushrooms. Combining mushroom consumption with green tea—sipping a half teabag’s worth of green tea every day along with eating that half a mushroom—was associated with nearly a 90% drop in breast cancer odds. 	-	Asia,breast cancer,breast disease,breast health,cold steeping,dried mushrooms,estrogen,Green tea,mushrooms,soy,soy milk,white mushrooms,white tea	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-vs-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/asian-paradox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-vs-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-do-asian-women-have-less-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-376	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/06/mushrooms-for-breast-cancer-prevention/	Mushrooms for Breast Cancer Prevention	Breast cancer can take decades to develop, so “early” detection via mammogram may be too late. The breast cancer you may feel one day as a lump in the shower, may have started 20 years ago.  We now suspect that all the epithelial cancers: breast, colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, ovarian—the ones that cause the vast majority of cancer deaths—take up to 20 years or more to manifest. By the time it’s picked up it may have already been growing, maturing, scheming for years, acquiring hundreds of new survival-of-the-fittest mutations to grow even quicker and better undermine our immune system. Early detection may in effect be really, really late detection. People are considered “healthy” until they show symptoms, so if we’ve been harboring a malignancy for 20 years we may feel all right, but we haven’t been. Thus, many people who do the right thing and improve their diet in hopes of preventing cancer may, at that very moment, be treating it as well. In this way, cancer prevention and treatment may sometimes be the same thing. What new developments are there are in the battle against breast cancer? Well, most breast tumors are estrogen receptor positive, meaning they respond to estrogen; estrogen makes them grow. The problem for tumors in postmenopausal women is that there isn’t much estrogen around—unless of course you take it in a drug like Premarin (so-named because it’s made from pregnant mare urine). Premarin appears to increase the risk of breast cancer (as well as strokes, heart attacks, and blood clots). Unfortunately, the plant-based bioidentical hormone replacement therapies don’t appear any safer (see my 4-min. video Plant-Based Bioidentical Hormones). Thankfully millions of women stopped taking Premarin in 2002, and we saw a nice dip in breast cancer rates. Unfortunately, those rates have since stagnated. Hundreds of thousands of American women continue to get the dreaded diagnosis every year. So what next? Well, with no estrogen around, many breast tumors devise a nefarious plan—they’ll just make their own! Seventy percent of breast cancer cells synthesize estrogen themselves using an enzyme called aromatase. In response, drug companies have produced a number of aromatase inhibitor drugs that are used as chemotherapy agents. Of course by the time you’re on chemo it can be too late, so researchers started screening hundreds of natural dietary components in hopes of finding something that targets this enzyme. To do this you need a lot of human tissue. Where are you going to get it from? To study skin, for example, researchers use discarded human foreskins from circumcision. They’re just being thrown away–might as well use them! Where are you going to get discarded female tissue? Placentas. They got a bunch of women to donate their placentas after giving birth to further this critical line of research. After years of searching, they found seven vegetables with significant anti-aromatase activity. You can see the graph in my video Vegetables Versus Breast Cancer. Bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, celery, green onions, and spinach dropped aromatase activity by about 20%, but mushrooms forced down the estrogen-producing enzyme more than 60%. Which mushroom worked best? Woodear, crimini, oyster, Italian brown, enoki, button, stuffing, shiitake, chanterelle, or Portobello mushrooms? Don’t even try to guess—you won’t get it! Check out my 2-min video Breast Cancer Prevention: Which Mushroom Is Best? for the answer. More on the magic of mushrooms in Making Our Arteries Less Sticky and Constructing a Cognitive Portfolio.

A-377	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/06/04/plant-based-diets-for-metabolic-syndrome/	Plant-Based Diets for Metabolic Syndrome	Metabolic syndrome, also known as syndrome X, is a medical disorder characterized by the so-called “deadly quartet”: abdominal obesity, high fasting blood sugars, high triglycerides, and high blood pressure. Metabolic syndrome can set people up for liver disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. It’s been estimated to afflict about a quarter of the American population. How do we stop it and how can we prevent it? Well, if it has to do with obesity, the level of fat in the blood, and high blood pressure then that would seem like a job for plant-based nutrition. In my 2012-2013 year-in-review presentation Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death I address the role diet may play in preventing, arresting, and reversing our top 15 killers, including many related conditions. We didn’t have data on metabolic syndrome specifically, though, until now. The results can be seen in my 2-min. video Metabolic Syndrome and Plant-Based Diets. Even after controlling for lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, risk was highest in those eating non-vegetarian, intermediate for those eating semi-vegetarian, and lowest in those eating vegetarian, cutting the odds of having metabolic syndrome by more than half. We see that same step-wise progression towards lower disease risk the more plant-based one’s diet gets with high blood pressure, cataracts, diabetes, and obesity. To maximize benefits it appears we have to move towards maximizing the proportion of plants in our diet, but it’s not all or nothing. Just adding more healthy plant foods to crowd out some of the animal and junk foods in the diet may offer significant protection. For example, consumption of three portions of whole grains a day appears as powerful as high blood pressure medications in alleviating hypertension. An analysis of a bunch of randomized drug trials suggests that taking blood pressure lowering drugs may reduce the risk of getting a heart attack by 15% and the risk of getting a stroke by about 25%, the same benefits attributed to three daily servings of whole grains. Some grains appear to be more protective than others, though. Watch my 2-min. video Whole Grains May Work As Well As Drugs to find out which may work better.

A-378	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/30/plant-based-diets-for-psoriasis/	Plant-Based Diets for Psoriasis	Plant-based diets appear to decrease inflammation via a variety of mechanisms, including boosting our adrenal gland function. Glucocorticoids are circulating steroid hormones produced by our adrenal glands that suppress inflammation and also help our kidneys excrete potassium. When we eat a lot of potassium-rich foods our adrenal glands secrete more glucocorticoids to keep our potassium levels in check, which may have the side effect of decreasing the level of inflammation in the body. See my 3-min video Potassium and Autoimmune Disease for the effect this may have on autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. Where is potassium found? See my post last week, 98% of American Diets Potassium Deficient. Hint: bananas don’t even make the top 50 sources! What about autoimmune arthritis? See my previous post Plant-Based Diets for Rheumatoid Arthritis and my videos Preventing Arthritis and Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis. Eating healthier doesn’t improve everyone’s joint pain, but as with all nontoxic treatment modalities, they should always be tried first. Plant-based diets may help with other pain syndromes: as well as other hypersensitivity diseases: –Michael Greger, M.D. 	-	allergies,arthritis,autoimmune arthritis,fibromyalgia,glucocorticoids,inflammation,pain,plant-based diet,potassium,psoriasis,rheumatoid arthritis,steroid hormones,steroids,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/16/plant-based-diets-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-and-autoimmune-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/16/plant-based-diets-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/23/98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-and-autoimmune-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-379	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/28/dr-gregers-natural-nausea-remedy-recipe/	Dr. Greger's Natural Nausea Remedy Recipe	I travel a lot. When I was on the road full time, there were months I’d give over 40 presentations in 30 days across dozens of cities. My speaking schedule is still fuller than I’d like (especially now that I can save lives online in my jammies!), but I do love meeting folks face to face. One problem I’ve always had, though, is motion sickness. Whether in planes, trains, or automobiles I’ve struggled my whole life getting nauseated in moving vehicles As a physician I can prescribe myself an array of powerful anti-nausea drugs, but I’ve always strived to find natural remedies for myself and my patients to avert the risks of side-effects (which take the lives of more than 100,000 Americans every year). As I noted in my video Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees, ginger has been found to be an effective remedy for nausea. Though used for thousands of years in traditional healing systems (in India it’s known as maha aushadhi, meaning “the great medicine”), ginger wasn’t proven to reduce nausea until 1982 when it beat out Dramamine in a head-to-head test in volunteers spun blindfolded in a tilted rotating chair. Ginger is now considered a nontoxic broad-spectrum antiemetic (anti-vomiting agent) effective in countering nausea during motion sickness, pregnancy, chemo, radiation, and after surgery. I’ve tried nearly every ginger candy, chew, syrup, tea, ale and gum on the market and found them to be uniformly wimpy. At the other end of spectrum I’ve cringed on an eye-watering variety of fresh ginger extracts and glycerites. I needed to find something that packed a punch without actually burning my mouth. That’s how this recipe was born: Lemon-Ginger Apple Chews Liquify the lemon, ginger, and turmeric in a high speed blender. Coat the apple slices with the blended mixture and place in a dehydrater until desired chewiness. I like them a little moist, but they can be also be dehydrated further into crispy apple chips for longer storage. For me, a few pieces eaten about 20 minutes before travel works wonders.  I imagine mangoes would work well too. Please let me know in the comment section below if you come up with any yummy variations. Ginger is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but the maximum recommended daily dose of fresh ginger during pregnancy is 20 grams (about 4 teaspoons of freshly grated). More than that may have uterine-stimulating effects. So those using these to combat morning sickness should spread this recipe out over several days. There is insufficient safety data regarding the use of turmeric during pregnancy, and so the turmeric should be omitted from the recipe for use for morning sickness. And because of the soluble oxalates in turmeric, even if not pregnant I wouldn’t recommend eating more than a half a batch a day. Ginger also has all sorts of other wonderful properties. See for example Plants vs. Pesticides and Amyloid and Apple Juice.

A-380	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/21/plant-based-diets-for-multiple-sclerosis/	Plant-Based Diets for Multiple Sclerosis	The distinguished neurologist Roy Swank‘s low saturated fat diet remains the “most effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ever reported in the peer review literature.” In patients with early stage MS, 95% were without progression of their disease 34 years after adopting his meat and dairy-restricted diet. Even patients with initially advanced disease showed significant benefit. To date, no medication or invasive procedure has ever come close to demonstrating such success. To understand one reason why a plant-based diet may be so successful in treating the disabling auto-immune disease, one has to first understand how the immune system works. This was one of the greatest mysteries in all of biology—solved by a brilliant scientist who won the Nobel in 1960 for figuring it out. As I illustrate in my 3-min. video Clonal Selection Theory of Immunity, each one of our antibody-producing immune cells, called B-cells, produces only one type of antibody. Antibodies are one of the main weapons our immune system uses to attack foreign invaders. And they’re specific. It’s not just like we have one B-cell that covers grass pollen and another that covers bacteria, we have a B-cell in our body whose only job is to make antibodies against the pollen of purple Siberian oniongrass! (whether or not we ever come in contact with it). Another whose only job is to make antibodies against the tail proteins of bacteria that live only in the thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean… Wait a second. There must be a billion different things in the world. If each of our B cells produces only one type of antibody, then we’d need to have a billion different types of B cells. And we do! So, let’s suppose one day you’re walking along and get attacked by a platypus (they have poison spurs on their heels you know). And so for your whole life up until that point the B-cell in your body that produces antibodies against duck-billed platypus venom was just hanging around, twiddling its thumbs, until that very moment. As soon as the venom is detected that specific B-cell starts dividing like crazy, making copies of itself, and soon you have a whole swarm of clones specialized for platypus poison protection. Fending off the toxin, you live happily ever after. That is how the immune system works. Aren’t our bodies spectacular? If we have a billion different types of antibody-producing B cells, each capable of recognizing a different molecular signature, why then do we tend not to attack ourselves? And how can what we eat sometimes undermine this inherent protection from autoimmune disease? As I describe in my 3-min video Clonal Deletion Theory of Immunity, the reason that we don’t often fall prey to friendly fire is because before we’re even born we  kill off each and every B cell that recognizes us. That’s what our thymus gland is for. When we’re still a fetus, our body lines up all our immune cells, holds up a picture of our self and asks them one by one: “do you recognize this person?” And if any of our immune cells says yes, they’re killed on the spot, death by apopotosis (programmed cell death) and good riddance. Turns out this process of ridding our bodies of self-recognizing immune cells happens throughout our lives, mostly in our bone marrow. If you remember, though, in my video series on IGF-1 (starting with The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle) animal protein consumption increases the level of a cancer-promoting growth hormone that prevents apoptosis, prevents our body’s killing of cells it wants to get rid—that’s why IGF-1 levels are linked to cancer. So IGF-1 might contribute to the inappropriate survival of self-reactive white blood cells in autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Maybe that’s why people who eat plant-based diets appear protected from autoimmune diseases, explaining, for example, the extraordinary rarity of most autoimmune diseases among sub-Saharan rural blacks following a traditional plant-based diet.   Before they changed their diets, evidently not a single case of MS had been diagnosed among a population of 15 million. 	-	antibodies,auto-immune disease,B-cells,cancer,growth hormone,IGF-1,immune system,multiple sclerosis,plant-based diet,prostate,prostate gland growth,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clonal-selection-theory-of-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clonal-deletion-theory-of-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22666902,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2009nl/jan/ms.htm,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clonal-selection-theory-of-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/clonal-deletion-theory-of-immunity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-381	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/16/plant-based-diets-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/	Plant-Based Diets for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Plant-based diets may help rheumatoid arthritis by decreasing exposure to an inflammatory “Trojan horse” compound found in animal products called Neu5Gc. In How Tumors Use Meat to Grow I talked about the inflammatory role Neu5Gc may play in stimulating breast cancer growth, but what about inflammation in our joints? For those of you who have been following my work since the beginning, you’ll remember back in 2003 I covered a landmark paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences entitled “Human intake and incorporation of an immunogenic nonhuman dietary sialic acid.” They took autopsy samples and discovered proof of Neu5Gc in human tumors. In my video The Inflammatory Meat Molecule Neu5Gc you can see it stained brown in human breast cancer, melanoma, brain tumors, and ovarian cancer. The presence of Neu5Gc in human tumors mystified researchers, because human beings are genetically unable to produce this substance. But other animals can. Maybe, the researchers proposed, human beings absorbed it from eating these other animals? So they put it to the test. Because Neu5Gc is found in animals and animal products, the researchers had to first eat vegan for a few days to clear their system (including no animal-derived ingredients in foods or drugs or shampoo), and then they basically drank a glass of diluted pig mucous. Within days this invading meat molecule could be found oozing from their bodies, in their saliva, urine—even their hair clippings. They concluded: “Because NeuGc-type compounds are not found in plants, and Neu5Gc is not synthesized by microbes, the dietary source of Neu5Gc must be foods of animal origin.” They proposed that the metabolic incorporation of this molecular “Trojan horse” from animal products may be contributing to the higher rates of cancer and heart disease in those that eat meat and dairy. Why heart disease too? If you check out my 3-min video Nonhuman Molecules Lining Our Arteries, you’ll see that this foreign meat molecule tends to accumulate not only in the lining of hollow organs (where carcinomas like breast cancer develop inside your glands), but also in the lining of blood vessels. This may be contributing to the hardening of our arteries, the #1 killer of men and women in the United States. Inflammation is one of the three steps en route to fatal heart disease. See: Antioxidants found predominantly in plants may also decrease inflammation within the body. Nuts may be particularly useful in this regard. The absorption of the inflammatory molecule Neu5Gc from animal foods may also explain why vegetarian diets seem to improve rheumatoid arthritis. Maybe the incorporation of this reactive alien molecule into inflamed tissue such as arthritic joints could be aggravating arthritis. That could explain why rheumatoid arthritis is not present in most other great apes. What we do know is that if you take animal products away, rheumatoid sufferers can feel better within weeks–see Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis and Preventing Arthritis. Bacterial endotoxins are another reason animal products may trigger an inflammatory immune reaction. See: Beyond the putative role of nonhuman Neu5GC as a potential molecular link between diet, autoreactive antibodies, and the progression of human cancer and heart disease, I close out the Neu5Gc story with a 3-min. video entitled Meat May Exceed Daily Allowance of Irony. It turns out that consuming Neu5GC may set children up for life-threatening reactions to E. coli toxins originating in the same animal products. The researchers ask if this is “poetic justice” for meat eaters. Not when it’s a major cause of acute life-threatening kidney failure in children. For more on E. coli, see Fecal Bacteria Survey and Chicken Out of UTIs. My exploration into Neu5GC spanned a seven video series (starting with Cancer as an Autoimmune Disease). If you’d rather these more extensive probes than my one-off videos, I’ve done similar in-depth series on reversing cancer cell growth, why animal products cause inflammation, changing vitamin D recommendations, arugula athleticism, why nuts don’t appear to cause expected weight gain, as well as the latest dietary guidelines. 	-	antioxidants,arthritis,atherosclerosis,autoreactive antibodies,cardiac disease,e. coli,hardening of the arteries,heart disease,immune system,inflammatory meat particle,joint inflammation,Neu5Gc,rheumatoid arthritis,tumors,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/14/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-out-of-utis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nonhuman-molecules-lining-our-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-may-exceed-daily-allowance-of-irony/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-recommendations-changed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-corporate-guidance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/	http://www.pnas.org/content/100/21/12045.full.pdf+html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-out-of-utis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nonhuman-molecules-lining-our-arteries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-may-exceed-daily-allowance-of-irony/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-recommendations-changed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/14/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-corporate-guidance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/	
A-382	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/14/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow/	How Tumors Use Meat to Grow	Certain cancers—like breast cancer—can be thought of in part as an autoimmune disease. When people get heart or kidney transplants, they must be given immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the new organ. What do you suppose happens to cancer rates in those individuals who have their immune systems suppressed? Well, for some types of cancer, like skin cancer, the risk goes up. This supports the so-called immune surveillance theory—the idea that our immune system acts as a natural defense system for keeping cancer under control (see a cool video of immune cells taking on a cancer cell here). This could explain why, as we age and our immune function declines, our risk of cancer goes up. The problem with the immune surveillance concept is that for some cancers, suppressing immune function decreases risk. After a kidney transplant, though your skin cancer risk may go up, your breast cancer and rectal cancer risk goes down. Why would people with depressed immune systems have less cancer? This led to a new theory of cancer I explore in my 4-min. video Cancer as an Autoimmune Disease. The only reason the immune system is even able to pick out cancerous cells from noncancerous cells is because tumors express foreign looking molecules that stimulate our immune system. Why would tumors do that? Why would cancer cells go out of their way to wave a red flag around saying, “Hey, come get me!”? We think it’s because cancer tends to thrive in a setting of low level inflammation. In the video I show a number of examples of chronic inflammation leading to cancer–ulcerative colitis to colon cancer, chronic pancreatitis to pancreatic cancer, chronic hepatitis to liver cancer, and stomach inflammation to stomach cancer. Oftentimes the body’s inflammatory immune response can further cancer’s agenda. By inciting an immune response, cancer creates its own inflammation, which may stimulate angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels to bring blood to the tumor and help it grow. This may explain the mystery surrounding Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer affecting those with AIDS. When you start treating AIDS and the immune system starts to recover you can actually see a flare in the cancer. So what are the dietary implications of this new autoimmune theory of cancer? See my 3-min. video How Tumors Use Meat to Grow: Xeno-Autoantibodies. In short, there’s a molecule called Neu5Gc found in nonhuman animals but not made by the human species. Cancerous breast tumors appear to incorporate this molecule that women consume in meat and dairy to trick their immune systems into creating the environment of low-grade inflammation that breast cancer thrives in. Our own cancer may use what we feed on to get what it feeds on. For more on Neu5Gc, one of the most fascinating topics of modern day nutrition, see my 4-min. video The Inflammatory Meat Molecule Neu5Gc. Why else might those eating plant-based diets have lower risk of all cancers combined? Kathy Freston wrote a good summary. It could be due to diminished exposure to IGF-1, heme iron, inflammation, viruses, antibiotics, saturated fat, nitrosamines, and arachidonic acid associated with animal product consumption. Or it could be the DNA repair,cellular stress defenses, anti-inflammatory properties, soy, lignans, phytonutrients, and fiber associated with healthy plant food consumption. It’s probably both, so it may not be enough to just eat vegan—we need to eat our veggies too. 	-	breast cancer,cancer,immune system,immunosuppressive drugs,inflammation,inflammatory meat particle,inflammatory response,Neu5Gc,tumors,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow-xeno-autoantibodies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogenic-retrovirus-found-in-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-and-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-tumors-use-meat-to-grow-xeno-autoantibodies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogenic-retrovirus-found-in-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-freston/vegan-diet-cancer_b_2250052.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-and-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-as-an-autoimmune-disease/	
A-383	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/09/how-to-gain-weight-on-diet-soda/	How to Gain Weight on Diet Soda	Erythritol, the too-good-to-be-true nontoxic, low-calorie, tooth friendly sweetener that I profiled in my last blog post “Is There a Safe, Low-Calorie Sweetener?” may even act as an antioxidant. So what’s the catch? Well, there are three ways that all low-caloric sweeteners could theoretically be harmful independent of their specific chemistry. As I report in my 2-min. video How Diet Soda Could Make Us Gain Weight, several large studies have found an association between artificial sweetener use and weight gain, meaning the people that drank the most diet soda, for example, gained the most weight. The most common explanation for this counterintuitive finding is what’s called reverse causation. People aren’t fat because they drink diet soda; they drink diet soda because they’re fat! But there are at least three less benign alternative explanations. The first is called “overcompensation for expected caloric reduction.” If you covertly switch someone’s soda for diet soda without him or her knowing it, his or her caloric intake drops. Obviously, right? They’re not drinking all that sugar anymore. But what if you tell them what you did? People who knowingly are consuming artificial sweeteners may actually end up eating more calories. Why? Because they’re like hey, I’m drinking diet soda, so I can have two pieces of cake. One of the studies I profile involved giving people an artificially sweetened cereal for breakfast, but only half were told. When it came to lunchtime, the group that knew they had eaten an artificially sweetened cereal ate significantly more than those that didn’t know any different. Basically, it’s the diet-soda-with-a-fast-food-meal syndrome. One may only lose weight on diet soda if you don’t realize it’s calorie-free. The second reason even the most harmless noncaloric sweetener could still be harmful if we’re not careful has to do with how our brain is wired. Watch my 2-min. video Neurobiology of Artificial Sweeteners to learn how the disconnect between sweetness sensations coming from our tongue and the lack of a caloric feedback loop in the gut may result in overeating. Finally, all sweeteners–natural and artificial, caloric and non-caloric—help maintain cravings for intensely sweet foods. As I explain in my 2-min. video Unsweetening the Diet, if you go on a low salt diet, for the first few weeks everything tastes like cardboard until your taste buds have a chance to adapt to the new norm. After that, natural low sodium foods taste perfectly fine and adding table salt tastes gross because it’s way too salty. Same thing with the sweeteners. At home maybe you use a harmless sweetener like erythritol—that’s great, but then what if you go on vacation and forget it at home? You still take your preference for severely sweet food with you and that may end up translating into the increased consumption of less than healthy foods. So those are the caveats for even nontoxic sweeteners. They are only safe if you don’t use them as an excuse to eat more junk food. 	-	diet soda,erythritol,junk food,sugar,weight gain	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/neurobiology-of-artificial-sweeteners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsweetening-the-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-diet-soda-could-make-us-gain-weight/,http://www.care2.com/greenliving/erythritol-the-only-safe-low-calorie-sweetener.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/neurobiology-of-artificial-sweeteners/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsweetening-the-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-384	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/07/is-there-a-safe-low-calorie-sweetener/	Is There a Safe, Low-Calorie Sweetener?	The natural sweetener erythritol does not appear to carry the adverse effects associated with other low and non-caloric natural and artificial sweeteners and may actually have antioxidant potential. For a while it was only available in Japan but now it’s becoming more accessible. It’s found naturally in pears and grapes, but industrially we have yeast make it for us. It doesn’t cause cavities and hasn’t been implicated in some of the disorders tied to other sweeteners such as fibromyalgia (see my video Aspartame-Induced Fibromyalgia), preterm birth (Diet Soda and Preterm Birth), headaches, hypertension, brain disorders, and platelet disorders (see A Harmless Artificial Sweetener). What about stevia? The jury is finally in. The reason it’s been such a long time coming is that research out of Japan in the ’90s found that steviosides, the active ingredient in stevia, appeared totally harmless, but in the guts of rats intestinal bacteria transformed steviosides into something called steviol, which is toxic, causing a big spike in mutagenic DNA damage (see the graph in Is Stevia Good For You?). So the question was do we have those same rat bacteria in our guts, and it turns out we do. So we now know that when we eat stevia, mutagenic compounds are produced in our colons and absorbed into our bloodstream. The only remaining question was how much. In the World Health Organization’s evaluation of food additives, they consider up to 4 mg/kg of body weight safe. So that’s 1.8 mg per pound. If you multiply your ideal weight in pounds by 1.8, that’s about how many milligrams of stevia compounds you should stay under on an average daily basis. As long as one consumes less than, say, two stevia-sweetened beverages a day, stevia can be considered harmless. Erythritol may be even better than harmless, though, as you can see in my 2-min. video Erythritol May Be a Sweet Antioxidant. There are two caloric sweeteners that are health-promoting—can you guess which ones? Check out The Healthiest Sweetener for a comparison of agave nectar, blackstrap molasses, brown rice syrup, corn syrup, brown sugar, date sugar, honey, maple syrup, raw cane sugar, and turbinado sugar. 	-	agave,date sugar,erythritol,headaches,hypertension,maple syrup,stevia,steviol,sweetener	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-soda-and-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-induced-fibromyalgia/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-soda-and-preterm-birth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-harmless-artificial-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-sweetener/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspartame-induced-fibromyalgia/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-385	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/02/are-microgreens-healthier/	Are Microgreens Healthier?	USDA researchers recently published a study assessing the nutrition content of 25 commercially available microgreens, seedlings of vegetables and herbs that have gained popularity in upscale markets and restaurants. Just a few inches tall, they boast intense flavors and vivid colors, but what about their nutritional content? No one knew until now. We’ve known that baby spinach leaves, for example, have higher levels of phytonutrients than mature spinach leaves, but what about really baby spinach–just a week or two old? Microgreens won hands down (leaves down?), possessing significantly higher nutrient densities than mature leaves. For example, red cabbage microgreens have a 6-fold higher vitamin C concentration than mature red cabbage and 69 times the vitamin K. Microgreens are definitively more nutrient dense, but are often eaten in small quantities. Even the healthiest garnish isn’t going to make much of a difference to one’s health, and microgreens may go for $30 a pound! But BYOM—birth your own! You can have rotating trays of salad that you can snip off with scissors. It’s like gardening for the impatient—fully-grown in just 7 to 14 days! If that’s too long, what about sprouting? See my 1-min. video Antioxidants Sprouting Up to see what happens to the antioxidant content of seeds, grains, and beans when you sprout them. Homemade sprouts are probably the most nutrition-per-unit-cost we can get for our money. See Biggest Nutrition Bang for Your Buck, where they beat out the previous champ, purple cabbage (Superfood Bargains). Broccoli sprouts are probably the best—see for example The Best Detox and Sulforaphane From Broccoli to Breast. I would recommend against alfalfa sprouts (even when home sprouted) as fecal bacteria from manure can hide in the seed’s nooks and crannies and cause illness: Don’t Eat Raw Alfalfa Sprouts. 	-	alfalfa sprouts,antioxidants,microgreens,red cabbage	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-sprouting-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sulforaphane-from-broccoli-to-breast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biggest-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-raw-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-sprouting-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/sulforaphane-from-broccoli-to-breast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biggest-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20329797,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22812633,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dont-eat-raw-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-386	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/30/aspartame-fibromyalgia-preterm-birth/	Aspartame: Fibromyalgia & Preterm Birth	When we learned how bad butter was, the food industry responded by giving us margarine, which turned out to be even worse. When dietary guidelines told us to lower our fat intake in hopes that we’d pick up an apple, the food industry gave us fudge drizzled Snackwell cookies. Similar reasoning led to the billion-dollar diet soda industry. A recent study profiled in my 2-min.video Diet Soda and Preterm Birth entitled “Intake of Artificially Sweetened Soft Drinks and Risk of Preterm Delivery: A Prospective Cohort Study in 59,334 Pregnant Danes” concluded that the daily intake of diet soda may increase the risk of preterm delivery. It probably wasn’t the caffeine or preservatives, since sweetened versions of the same sodas didn’t result in the same problem. So what is it? They think it’s the toxic aspartame (Nutrasweet) breakdown products either affecting the mother’s uterus or directly affecting the baby’s developing nervous system. These are the same toxins (wood alcohol and formaldehyde) blamed for headaches associated with aspartame. If you watch my 2-min. video Aspartame-Induced Fibromyalgia, I profile case reports of fibromyalgia chronic pain sufferers cured by removing the artificial sweetener from their diets. As far as I’m concerned, nontoxic treatments should always get precedence, and you can’t get much more nontoxic than removing processed foods from your diet! Alternately, many folks suffering with fibromyalgia symptoms may have been misdiagnosed and are actually suffering from an easily treated vitamin D deficiency. What’s the best way to treat that? See Vitamin D Pills vs. Tanning Beds, one of my dozen videos on vitamin D. I’ve got a bunch of previous videos on sweeteners including Is Nutrasweet Bad For You?  Erythritol is probably A Harmless Artificial Sweetener. Of course regular soda isn’t good for us either. High fructose corn syrup may contain mercury and have adverse effect on our children (Diet & Hyperactivity).

A-387	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/25/bugs-drugs-in-pork-yersinia-and-ractopamine/	Bugs & Drugs in Pork: Yersinia & Ractopamine	Consumer Reports recently released a study in which they analyzed U.S. retail pork and found trace levels of an adrenaline-like drug called ractopamine in about 20 percent of the samples and a foodborne bacteria that sickens nearly 100,000 Americans every year called Yersina in two-thirds of pork samples. Ractopamine safety analysis The National Pork Producers Council tried to address concerns about ractopamine by noting that the levels in meat of this muscle growth promoter, which is fed to pigs in the form of Paylean™ and turkeys in the form of Topmax™, were below the limit set by the UN Codex Commission last summer. What they didn’t mention was that due to outstanding safety concerns, the Commission’s drug residue limit only passed by a single vote out of 143 ballots cast. The Codex Commission based this drug residue limit in meat on the only human data available, a study of just six people that wasn’t designed to establish safety. At higher doses, the study subjects reported their hearts racing and pounding—so much so that one subject had to be withdrawn from the study. At a lower dose, though, no cardiac changes were noted. So that’s the dose the Codex Commission used to calculate the maximum allowable meat residue and acceptable human daily intake levels. Just because a certain dose doesn’t cause a problem in six people is no certainty that the dose is safe for everyone. The European Food Safety Authority—Europe’s equivalent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration—calculated that a study of six people wouldn’t even have the statistical power to pick up a 40 percent change in cardiac output, a key measured endpoint. To detect as statistically significant a clinically relevant change, the study would have required at least 60 people. Also, the study only looked at the cardiovascular effects of ractopamine. Given its adrenaline-like effects, the drug could also cause metabolic effects in people such as an increase in blood sugar levels or behavioral effects such as restlessness or anxiety. Finally, all six study subjects were healthy young men. What about particularly vulnerable populations such as children or people with heart disease? The European Food Safety Authority panel concluded that the Codex limit did not sufficiently take these higher risk populations into account. They concluded that the single small human study “can not be taken as a basis to derive an acceptable daily intake…and consequently no proposal for maximum [meat] residue levels could be made.” In other words, we simply don’t have enough data to determine a safe level of drug exposure from meat. Ractopamine – animal health and welfare The Council of the European Union recently joined China in reaffirming the ban on ractopamine, citing both human health and animal welfare concerns. Studies over the last decade have shown that pigs on ractopamine may have chronically elevated heart rates, increased stress reactions, and difficulty walking. In fact the warning label reads: ‘‘Caution: Pigs fed PAYLEAN are at an increased risk for exhibiting the downer pig syndrome,” a condition in which pigs are too sick, injured, or exhausted to stand and may be dragged to slaughter. The pork industry uses an ironic pretext to defend its use of gestation crates – restrictive cages that virtually immobilize breeding pigs for nearly their entire lives. The industry claims this is to keep them from fighting, but at the same time pork producers feed millions of fattening pigs a drug shown to increases aggressiveness and attacks. Given the human and animal welfare concerns, why does the U.S. pork industry continue to feed this drug to their animals every year? A meta-analysis was recently published in the Journal of Animal Science. Based on all the studies done to date, pigs fed ractopamine “had an overall carcass cutability advantage of 1.01 percentage units when compared to control pigs.” All this for a 1 percent greater yield. For more on this drug in the meat supply, see my 6-min. video Ractopamine in Pork. For more on the drug use by the livestock industry see: Yersinia – the gift that can keep on giving The discovery of Yersinia in pork is no surprise. Pigs are considered to be to be the main reservoir for Yersinia enterocolitica and pork products the main source of human infection. While most foodborne pathogens come from a variety of sources, 100 percent of the attributable Yersinia outbreaks reported in the United States from 1999 through 2008 were caused by pork. What was a surprise is the level of contamination of the U.S. pork supply—69 percent of samples tested positive—and the level of antibiotic resistance. Ninety percent of the Yersinia bacteria found contaminating the pork was resistant to one or more antibiotics. In most cases, Yersinia food poisoning causes an acute “stomach flu” characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and often bloody diarrhea. Severe cases are frequently confused with appendicitis, leading to unnecessary emergency surgery. Long-term complications of infection include chronic inflammation of the eyes, kidneys, heart, and joints. Within a year of a bout of Yersinia food poisoning, victims appear to have a 47-fold higher risk of coming down with autoimmune arthritis. The bacteria may also play a role in triggering an autoimmune thyroid condition known as Graves’ disease. Yersinia – the role of factory farming The new findings, published in the January 2013 issue of Consumer Reports, are not surprising given how widespread the infection is in the national herd. The increasing emergence of human infections over the last century has been blamed on the industrialization of the pork industry and higher stocking densities. Inside swine confinement buildings, researchers have been able to culture Yersinia bacteria right out of the air. The pork industry acknowledges overcrowding pigs is associated with increased health risks, but the trade journal National Hog Farmer cites research showing that when “space was dropped to 6 sq. ft./pig, the building produced 26% more pounds of pork at the same fixed cost.” That entails cramming a 200-pound pig in a space equivalent to about 2 feet by 3 feet. Sometimes, the article concludes, “crowding grow-finish pigs a little tighter will make you more money.” With so many Americans falling ill from contaminated pork, why are there no industry-wide Yersinia monitoring and control programs in the United States? Perhaps this is because Yersinia enterocolitica doesn’t cause clinical disease in pigs and therefore doesn’t directly affect the industry’s bottom-line. The costs of crowded confinement may instead be passed on to the tens of thousands of Americans who continue to be sickened every year at an annual estimated cost of a quarter billion dollars. Research from Europe suggests pigs raised using organic methods – which in Europe means more than just what animals are fed – may have 50 times lower odds of harboring Yersinia enterocolitica infection compared to pigs raised on conventional factory farms. After studying a variety of factors, the researchers ended up attributing the low rates of Yersinia infection on organic farms to lower levels of stress among the animals. If stress is indeed a contributing factor, things may be looking up in Europe. On Jan. 1, 2013 gestation crates for pregnant pigs were banned across all 27 nations of the European Union. Crated sows have been shown to have impaired immunity, thought to be a result of elevated stress hormone levels related to being virtually immobilized for years on end. Pregnant sows in the U.S., where the majority are still crated, have been shown to have among the highest rates of Yersinia enterocolitica infection. Since infected piglets have been shown to carry the infection through to slaughter, the impact of stress levels on disease resistance of breeding pigs can have human health consequences. Thankfully, major U.S. retailers, restaurant chains, and leaders in the pork industry have started phasing out gestation crates, which may end up benefiting both animal welfare and the safety of the meat supply.

A-388	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/23/increasing-muscle-strength-with-fenugreek/	Increasing Muscle Strength with Fenugreek	The spice fenugreek appears to significantly improve muscle strength and weight lifting power output while possessing anti-cancer properties in vitro. In my 2-min video Benefits of Fenugreek Seeds I profile a study entitled “The effects of a commercially available botanical supplement on strength, body composition, power output, and hormonal profiles in resistance-trained males.” Something had a “significant impact on both upper- and lower-body strength and body composition in comparison to placebo in a double blind controlled trial. These changes were obtained with no clinical side effects.” Something allowed these men to leg press an extra hundred pounds compared to placebo. And the magical substance? Powdered fenugreek–a spice that may even double as an anti-cancer agent. In the video I show human prostate cancer cells in a petri dish before and after being exposed to various concentrations of fenugreek compared to the effect of the spice on normal prostate cells. The effect was striking. The study concluded: “In summary, fenugreek seeds may possess potent anti-cancer properties.” So what’s the downside? Well, there is a side effect of fenugreek seed consumption—it makes your armpits smell like maple syrup! See my 2-min. video Side-Effect of Fenugreek Seed Consumption for more. What happens to the armpit odor of those embracing entire diets full of plants? See Body Odor Diet. Then check out Asparagus Pee for another funky odor video. Fenugreek may be to strength training what beets and arugula are to cardio. My ten video series on improving athletic performance with vegetables starts with Doping With Beet Juice and ends with So Should We Drink Beet Juice or Not?. Other plants with apparently remarkable benefits include amla (see, for example, Amla Versus Diabetes), saffron (Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimers), the tea plant (Dietary Brain Wave Alteration), and humble broccoli (Broccoli Versus Breast Cancer Stem Cells). More on the power of plants in general in Power Plants and spices like fenugreek in particular in Antioxidants in a Pinch. See what a whole diet of plants can do to prostate cancer cell growth in Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay. Fenugreek is certainly something I’ve been trying to incorporate more into my family’s diet based on all this amazing new data. It’s strong stuff though! I’d be interested to hear any tips on how folks have been able to sneak it into their diets. I make these mean chia seed-encrusted dried mangoes that I sprinkle with fenugreek powder using the mix-a-yummy-with-yucky technique for adding less-than-delicious things to one’s diet (like putting amla in smoothies).

A-389	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/18/the-anti-wrinkle-diet/	The Anti-Wrinkle Diet	The skin is the largest organ in the body—about 20 square feet—and the most vulnerable organ in the body. It’s exposed to both the oxidizing effects of UV radiation from the sun and the oxidizing effects of oxygen in the air, and years of oxidant stress can take a toll. As we age, our skin becomes thinner, more easily damaged, loses volume and elasticity, and can sag and wrinkle. So what can we do about it? Three things contribute to the aging of skin: 1) Oxidative stress induced by sun-damage, 2) inflammation, and 3) ischemia or lack of adequate blood flow. Oxidative stress means we need antioxidants so one might predict plant foods would help (see Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods). Similarly saturated fat and cholesterol intake may contribute to inflammation and ischemia (see The Leaky Gut Theory of Why Animal Products Cause Inflammation and Blocking the First Step of Heart Disease). Let’s see if our predictions hold up. In my 3-min. video Beauty is More than Skin Deep I profile a study that concluded “In particular, a high intake of vegetables, legumes [beans, peas, lentils, and soy] and olive oil appeared to be protective against skin wrinkling, whereas a high intake of meat, dairy and butter appeared to have an adverse effect. Prunes, apples and tea appeared especially protective.” For more on the power of prunes see Dried Apples Versus Cholesterol and To Snack or Not to Snack?. Another recent study found that green tea phytonutrients were able to protect skin against harmful UV radiation and help improve women’s skin quality. After a few months on green tea there was a 16% reduction in skin roughness and a 25% reduction in scaling. See the video for micrographs that track the changes. For an extraordinary report on green tea and skin health, check out: Treating Gorlin Syndrome With Green Tea. Eating healthier can produce healthier skin, but who cares about microscopic changes? What about overt visible-to-the-naked eye changes? See my 2-min. video Preventing Wrinkles with Diet to see what dietary intervention may significantly protect against wrinkles in the crow’s foot area around the eyes. For other videos on appealing to vanity to get people to eat healthier, see: Want to know what else green vegetables can do? I’ve got 45 videos on greens.

A-392	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/09/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/	Gerson Therapy for Cancer?	Gerson Therapy is a largely diet-based alternative treatment for cancer that was invented by the late Dr. Max Gerson. What has 65 years of medical research concluded about its efficacy and safety? According to a recent review out of Sloan-Kettering in the journal Oncology, for about $16,000, you can fly to a clinic in Mexico, and spend three weeks “consuming fresh raw fruit and vegetable juices” and “eliminating salt from the diet.” Sounds pretty benign. Patients are also given a number of supplements, including pancreatic enzymes, as well as coffee enemas to “stimulate metabolism.” I do not deny that coffee enemas would be stimulating, but I don’t recommend them, given the case reports I note in my two-minute video, Gerson Therapy For Cancer—in which they’ve killed people. Is oral coffee okay? See my video Coffee and Cancer. To their credit, modern Gerson practitioners have moved away from the original tenets of the plan—which included feeding people raw calf liver smoothies—after too many people died from systemic blood infections. (These infections were from the same fecal bacteria in chicken that I cover in my video Poultry and Paralysis.) After learning of the outbreak, staff at the Gerson Institute decided that the policy of drinking blended liver was to be altered, and they apparently started injecting raw liver instead. But, hey, conventional cancer treatments are no walk in the park, either! The reason people choose them is in hopes that they work. How does the Gerson therapy compare? The first formal investigation into the treatment was back in 1947, and in the 65 years since, there have been over a dozen studies published. Most came to the same conclusion: Gerson therapy is useless or worse. These negative reviews of Gerson Therapy were written before a head-to-head trial was published of a Gerson-style (Gonzalez) regime versus chemotherapy, in terms of survival and quality of life for pancreatic cancer patients. That’s the study I profile in my three-minute video Gerson-style Therapy vs. Chemotherapy. You can read the study for yourself here (you’ll note that I always list links to all of the papers I cover in my videos in the “Sources Cited” section beneath each video). How do you prevent pancreatic cancer in the first place? See my video Largest Study Ever. Dietary strategies associated with prolonged cancer survival can be found in my videos: I’ve got dozens of other videos on alternative medicine in which I do my best to relay the balance of evidence. Just because it may be the best available science, though, doesn’t mean the science is particularly good (as demonstrated in my video, Gerson-style Therapy vs. Chemotherapy). But, how else can we make decisions, except with the best evidence available? 	-	alternative therapies,cancer,chemotherapy,coffee enemas,Dr. Max Gerson,Gerson Therapy,health,oncology,pancreatic cancer	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alternative-medicine/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/largest-study-ever/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/largest-study-ever/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-for-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gerson-therapy-vs-chemotherapy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alternative-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2860407/pdf/zlj2058.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-393	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/04/are-bioidentical-hormones-safe/	Are Bioidentical Hormones Safe?	Hormone replacement therapy for menopause grew to prominence in the 1990s, when millions of women were sold hormones made from horse urine. Premarin (from the words “pregnant mare urine”) was promised to prevent age-related diseases. When the truth got out, in 2002, that the opposite was true—it actually increased risk of heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and invasive breast cancer—the number of prescriptions dropped, and so did the rates of breast cancer. Thanks to some high-profile celebrity endorsements, interest then switched to so-called “compounded bioidentical hormones,” from plant rather than equine sources—which were said to work the same, without carrying the same risks. But, what does the science say? In my 4-minute video, Plant-Based Bioidentical Hormones, I note there’s been several new reviews on the subject from the American College of OB/GYNs, the Mayo Clinic, and the editors-in-chief of the Journal of the International Menopause Society. They all concluded that bioidentical hormones—being bio-identical!—carried the same risks, benefits, and side effects—which we now know is not a good thing. Even worse, when the FDA actually analyzed bioidentical hormone batches to see if the contents matched the label, nearly a third failed the analysis. Even in the same bottle, the dose of hormones could be all over the place. How do we know all these medical authorities condemning bioidentical hormones aren’t just in the pockets of drug companies that don’t want the competition? After all, there are literally billions of dollars at stake. Whenever I’m skeptical, I turn to The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, considered one of the least biased sources in medicine. It’s kind of like the Consumer Reports of the drug world—and, in fact, was actually co-founded by the co-founder of the publisher of Consumer Reports, more than 50 years ago. As The Medical Letter likes to brag on their website, they do not accept grants (from any source), donations (from anyone), or funding (from any entity). They won’t let their work be used for promotional purposes, and they don’t accept any advertising. The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics recently reviewed bioidentical hormones, and came to the same conclusion: “There is no acceptable evidence that bio-identical hormones are safe or effective. Patients should be discouraged from taking them.” Another way to rid oneself of excess estrogen is in the way nature intended. See my video: Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen. We can also stop consuming steroid hormones. See my videos Anabolic Steroids in Meat and Acne & Cancer Connection.

A-394	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/04/02/ergothioneine-a-new-vitamin/	Ergothioneine: A New Vitamin?	Ergothioneine was discovered a century ago but ignored until recently when researchers found that we have a transporter protein in our bodies specifically designed to pull it out of our diets and into our tissues. This suggests that it plays some important physiological role, but what does it do? Well our first clue was the tissue distribution. Ergothioneine concentrates in parts of our body where there’s lots of oxidative stress—the lens of our eye and the liver, as well as  sensitive areas such as bone marrow and seminal fluid. Researchers guessed that it might function as a so-called “cytoprotectant,” a cell protector, and that’s indeed what was subsequently found. Not only does ergothioneine get into the nucleus of our cells to protect our DNA, it can get into our mitochondria, the power plants of the cell. Ergothioneine appears to function as a potent intra-mitochondrial antioxidant. Why is that important?  In my 5-min. video Mitochondrial Theory of Aging I quote one of the greatest biochemists of all time: “Aging is a disease. The human lifespan simply reflects the level of free radical damage that accumulates in cells. When enough damage accumulates, cells can’t survive properly anymore and they just simply give up.” First proposed in 1972, the Mitochondrial Theory of Aging suggests that it’s free radical damage to our cells’ power source that leads to a loss of cellular energy and function over time. It’s a little like charging your iPod battery over and over again; every time you charge it the capacity gets less and less. In my Stopping Cancer Before it Starts DVD, I go into detail about the quantum biology of oxidative phosphorylation, but in a nutshell the oxygen we breathe may get ahold of an electron we ate that was pumped with energy by plants (thanks to photosynthesis). The oxygen molecule is thereby transformed into what’s called superoxide, which can damage (oxidize) our delicate cellular machinery. Basically we’re rusting—that’s what rust is, the oxidation of metal. Scientifically, aging has been considered the slow oxidation of our bodies. Like those brown age spots on the back of your hands? That’s just oxidized fat under the skin. Oxidant stress is why we get wrinkles, it’s why we lose some of our memory, and it’s why our organ systems break down as we get older. How do we slow down oxidation? By eating foods containing anti-oxidants. If you want to know if a food has a lot of antioxidants in it simply slice it open, expose it to air—expose it to oxygen–and see what happens. Does it oxidize? Does it turn brown? Think about our two most popular fruits: apples and bananas. They turn brown right away; not a lot of antioxidants inside there. How do you keep your fruit salad from turning brown though? Add lemon juice, which has vitamin C in it, an antioxidant, that can keep your food from oxidizing and may do the same thing inside our bodies. For an introduction on where antioxidants can be found in our diet, see Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods and Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. Here’s the catch: many antioxidants can’t penetrate through the mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondria. They can protect the rest of the cell including our DNA, but they can’t get access into the power plants of our cells and therefore may be helpless to slow down the aging process. Ergothioneine, however, is allowed access into our mitochondria. Where is it found in the diet? Mushrooms! Check out my 3-min. video Ergothioneine: A New Vitamin?. Other examples of the magic of mushrooms can be found in: Probably best to cook them though, see Toxins in Raw Mushrooms? 	-	aging,antioxidants,bone marrow,cytoprotectant,DNA,ergothioneine,free radicals,liver,mitochondria,oxidation,seminal fluid,vitamin C,vitamins	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ergothioneine-a-new-vitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-raw-mushrooms/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ergothioneine-a-new-vitamin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://www.drgreger.org/DVDs,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxins-in-raw-mushrooms/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-395	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/28/how-to-reduce-dietary-antibiotic-intake/	How To Reduce Dietary Antibiotic Intake	Recently the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention commemorated “Get Smart About Antibiotics Week,” which aimed to raise awareness about growing antibiotic resistance as one of the world’s most pressing public health threats. One way to combat this problem is avoid putting antibiotic-laden foods in our shopping carts and our families’ mouths. Though persistent organic pollutants like dioxins and PCBs can persist for years in our bodies (see my 2-min video How Fast Can Children Detoxify from PCBs?), other dietary contaminants such as antibiotic residues may be more of a matter of constant re-exposure on a day-to-day basis. As you can see in my 2-min. video Lowering Dietary Antibiotic Intake, a study last year measured changes in the levels of antibiotics before and after a 5 day vacation from meat. They tested participants’ urine for the presence of a number of clinically important human antibiotics. Though none of the study participants were actually taking these drugs, antibiotics were found flowing through their bodies.  Within just five days of eating vegetarian, though, the study “demonstrated clearly that even short-term dietary changes could reduce the frequency of detection and levels of major antibiotics.” A follow-up study testing antibiotic levels in meat directly found that “Consumption levels of beef, pork, chicken, and dairy products could explain the daily excretion amount of several antibiotics in urine.” Which has more though, chicken thigh or breast? Find out in my 1-min video More Antibiotics in White Meat or Dark Meat? This year, the Consumers Union—the publishers of Consumer Reports—launched a Meat Without Drugs campaign to pressure retailers to demand meat producers stop gobbling up 80% of the antibiotics sold in the United States to help fatten animals faster and prevent disease in such stressful, crowded, unhygienic environments (see for example, recent undercover footage at a Butterball turkey plant). Our exposure to drugs given to turkeys and chickens may be one reason poultry consumption has been associated with significantly higher lymphoma and leukemia risk.

A-396	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/26/how-to-counter-dietary-pollutants-pesticides/	Countering Dietary Pollutants & Pesticides	We have so polluted our planet that eight different pesticides were recently found contaminating the snow-capped tips of the Rocky Mountains. If they’re contaminated, then everywhere is contaminated. The best we can do is just try to eat as low on the food chain as possible–plant foods, preferably organic. Click on my 2-min. video Food Sources of Perfluorochemicals to see where a variety of industrial pollutants tend to concentrate in our food supply. Not only do plant foods tend to have significantly lower levels of industrial pollutants, they may have phytonutrients that combat the effects of some of these toxicants. In my 2-min. video Plants vs. Pesticides I profile an experiment where scientists dripped dioxin and DDT on some human white blood cells with and without a variety of phytonutrients to see if they would have a protective effect. The two most effective agents in protecting human blood cells appeared to be zerumbone, a compound naturally found in ginger, and auraptene, a natural component of citrus. These are very preliminary findings, as this was only done in a test tube and the researchers surveyed only a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of known phytonutrients. It does, however, open up the possibility that plant-based diets may play a dual role in protecting us against industrial pollutants by reducing our exposure and, potentially, reducing some of the damage these chemicals can cause. Get more information on ginger in Amyloid and Apple Juice and Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees. See how we can incorporate it in our diet in Healthy Pumpkin Pie and The Healthiest Beverage. 	-	auraptene,DDT,dietary pollutants,ginger,industrial pollutants,organic foods,perfluorochemicals,pesticides,phytonutrients,plant-based diets,pollutants,toxicants,zerumbone	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangerous-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amyloid-and-apple-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangerous-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plants-vs-pesticides/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/healthy-pumpkin-pie-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-397	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/21/protecting-our-babies-from-pollutants/	Protecting Our Babies From Pollutants	For those of us starting new families, one of the myriad concerns that come up is how we are ever going to get our children to eat their veggies. One answer that I profile in my 3-min. video The Best Baby Formula is to exclusively breast feed as long as possible. Apparently this doubles the likelihood that our children will end up eating twice as many vegetables when they grow older. How could that be? The researchers suggest that “breastfed babies, whose mothers regularly eat a variety of foods, are exposed to a diversity of flavors that are absent from formula milk and this early exposure augments the acceptance of various flavors.” So when they eventually eat some bitter broccoli, instead of spitting it out, they’re subconsciously like, “Hey, I remember this!” Perhaps this helps explain the evidence suggesting that the longer babies are breast fed, the lower their risk of developing inflammatory diseases such as asthma, cancer, and diabetes. The new Surgeon General’s report agrees with the official World Health Organization recommendation, which agrees with the best available science that all women in the world should exclusively breastfeed for a full 6 months. Whether your own milk, a wet nurse, or a milk bank, there is simply no good substitute. It’s the only “formula” for optimum health. Other tips on raising healthy children can be found in videos such as: Unfortunately parents tend to overestimate the quality of their children’s diets. For advice on how to best raise our children, one can’t beat the advice offered by the most esteemed pediatrician of all time, Dr. Benjamin Spock. Check out Dr. Spock’s advice in Doctors’ Nutritional Ignorance. In my 2-min. video Pollutants in Californian Breast Tissue, I showed the extent to which our bodies may become contaminated with industrial pollutants. Should we be worried that we might be passing toxins onto our children? See my 2-min. video The Wrong Way to Detox for an answer to that question. If that doesn’t motivate expectant mothers to eat healthier, I don’t know what will. Note, though, that the level of industrial pollutants mothers have in their fat tissue doesn’t necessarily reflect what they’re passing on to their child. Researchers last year decided to measure pesticide levels right out of the umbilical cord blood. At delivery, as soon as the cord was cut, a little blood was squirted into a vial before it was tied off. As I document in my 2 min. video DDT in Umbilical Cord Blood, even now, decades after DDT was banned, “almost all umbilical cord blood samples, 95%, showed detectable DDT residues.” It’s not exactly the first thing we want to be passing along to our newborns. Pesticide residue levels were most closely associated with the mother’s consumption of three types of foods: fish, other meat, and dairy products. Dozens of chemicals are found in the bodies of pregnant Americans according to the latest CDC Report on Environmental Chemical Exposure. Even with these data, breast is still always best. If someone was eating the Standard American diet when they were pregnant and ended up passing along a certain amount of toxic waste to their child, is it too late? If after the birth and weaning they decided to start a fresh page in their lives and feed their new child only the best, how long might it take our children to shed the industrial toxins they may have gotten from us in the womb or from the breast? In my 2-min. video How Fast Can Children Detoxify From PCBs? I profile a recent study that followed a cohort of children exposed at birth to PCBs from their mothers. They were tested at age 8 and then again at age 12 to get a sense of the half-life of these toxins within their bodies. Depending on the chemical pollutant, the estimated half-lives ranged from about 4 years to 9 years. Therefore, if our children eat a healthy diet and don’t play around in any toxic waste dumps, by the time they’re between 20 and 45 years of age they will have eliminated more than 95% of the PCB inheritance we gave them at birth. A problem they found in doing the study, though, is that they had to throw out a lot of data and exclude children who had obvious PCB reuptakes because their levels were even higher at age 12 than 8, meaning they were getting re-exposed. Where are some of these pollutants found? See my videos Food Sources of Flame Retardant Chemicals and Food Sources of Perfluorochemicals. Regardless of what kind of start our children get, it’s never too late to improve our families’ diets to prevent additional intake of these pollutants into their bodies. 	-	asthma,babies,baby formula,breast feed,cancer,children,dairy,DDT,detox,diabetes,Dr. Benjamin Spock,milk,PCBs,pesticides,pollutants,pregnant,umbilical cord blood,vegetables,World Health Organization	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/arsenic/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-californian-breast-tissue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-umbilical-cord-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%EF%BB%BFcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mothers-overestimate-dietary-quality/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-baby-formula/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ddt-in-umbilical-cord-blood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-flame-retardant-chemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/%EF%BB%BFcdc-report-on-environmental-chemical-exposure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-fast-can-children-detoxify-from-pcbs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pollutants-in-californian-breast-tissue/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mothers-overestimate-dietary-quality/	
A-398	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/19/pollutants-in-californian-breast-tissue/	Pollutants in Californian Breast Tissue	Americans are walking chemical cocktails according to the latest report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Organochlorine pesticides tend to build up in animal fat (see for example, Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification, Avoiding Other Banned Pesticides, and Industrial Carcinogens in Animal Fat) so we tend to think of meat, eggs, and dairy as being the most heavily contaminated, but there are concerning levels found in some plant foods too. See, for example, my 1-min video Pesticides in Chinese Bamboo Shoots. I don’t know which is worse, the fact that researchers found nine different pesticide residues in cans of bamboo shoots imported from China, or that they described it as “only” nine. Nearly all canned foods contain the chemical BPA, which has recently been linked to erectile dysfunction in men. In my 2-min. video BPA Plastic and Male Sexual Dysfunction I profile a study that concluded: “Increasing urine BPA level was associated with decreased sexual desire, more difficulty having an erection, lower ejaculation strength, and lower level of overall satisfaction with sex life.” The only fresh, non-canned food found contaminated with BPA was sliced turkey. I’ve previously covered BPA in Which Plastics Are Harmful?, where I detail which “numbers” of plastic are probably safest. My other video on plastics chemicals similarly found particularly high levels in poultry. Eden Foods is one of the few manufacturers that doesn’t use BPA. See my blog about their canned beans: Do Eden Beans Have Too Much Iodine? For more on male sexual health see: Measuring urine levels of industrial toxins is more useful than measuring food levels, since it indicates how much of the pollutants are actually absorbed into the body. In one sense it tells you what kind of levels are circulating in your body but at the same time it tells you how much your body is able to successfully get rid of. Ideally we’d like to measure levels in human tissues to see, for example, how much is actually lodged in one’s breast tissue. Well, people get breast surgery all the time–why not test surgical samples of removed tissue? Women get fibroids removed; we can test those. We could get data from fresh autopsy samples from accident victims, and hey, what about liposuction? In my 2-min. video Pollutants in Californian Breast Tissue I compare the levels of fire retardant chemicals (polybromated diphenyl ethers) in the breast tissue of California women to various tissue samples taken from women in Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, France,  Hong Kong,  Japan,  New York City,  Singapore, and Spain. Do we wish they could all be California?  No. The breast tissue of California women had nearly 10 times more than women in any other country, and compared to the lowest levels—autopsy samples of Japanese women—New Yorker liposuction had a hundred times higher levels. Sounds like they’re eating more than just big apples. Other than pet food and fish, which may be most contaminated, where do flame retardant chemicals (PBDE) and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCN) concentrate in the American food supply?

A-399	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/14/how-chemically-contaminated-are-we/	How Chemically Contaminated Are We?	Every few years the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measures the levels of chemical pollutants in the bodies of thousands of Americans from across the country. What did the latest report tell us about our toxic burden? Find out in my 2-min. video CDC Report on Environmental Chemical Exposure.  The official U.S. Presidential Cancer Panel report from the National Cancer Institute on reducing environmental cancer risk was also released recently. Quoting from the report: “With the growing body of evidence linking environmental exposures to cancer, the public is becoming increasingly aware of the unacceptable burden of cancer resulting from environmental and occupational exposures that could have been prevented through appropriate national action.” Every year in the United States there are one and a half million new cases of cancer a year striking men, women, and children. Unfortunately, the report concludes: “the grievous harm from this group of carcinogens has not been addressed adequately by the National Cancer Program. The American people—even before they are born—are bombarded continually with myriad combinations of these dangerous exposures. The Panel urges you, Mr. President, most strongly to use the power of your office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins from our food, water, and air that needlessly increase health care costs, cripple our Nation’s productivity, and devastate American lives.” Strong words, but what can we do? They don’t give much dietary guidance. Basically they just say choose organic and free-range: “Exposure to pesticides can be decreased by choosing, to the extent possible, food grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers and washing conventionally grown produce to remove residues. Similarly, exposure to antibiotics, growth hormones, and toxic run-off from livestock feed lots can be minimized by eating free-range meat raised without these medications if it is available. Avoiding or minimizing consumption of processed, charred, and well-done meats will reduce exposure to carcinogenic heterocyclic amines and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.” Of course even without industrial pollutants, the saturated animal fat and cholesterol may still contribute to heart disease (as evidenced by atherosclerosis in mummies of Egyptian rulers who likely ate rich diets). For a more detailed account of which foods are most contaminated, see Food Sources of PCB Chemical Pollutants and Dioxins in the Food Supply. My previous videos on organic foods include Can Pesticides Be Rinsed Off? and Cancer Fighting Berries. I also have videos on livestock growth hormones and feed additives.

A-400	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/12/saffron-vs-prozac-for-depression/	Saffron vs. Prozac for Depression	Millions of Americans suffer from depression every year, a disabling disease that can end up fatal (due to suicide).  In my last blog post, Treating PMS with Saffron, I noted remarkable benefits of the spice saffron on the emotional and physical symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. The researchers noticed a significant drop in symptoms of depression as well, and so decided to put saffron to the test. See my 2-min. video Saffron vs. Prozac for the head-to-head test of the simple spice versus the drug Prozac for the treatment of clinical depression. Remember saffron from my videos Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s and Saffron Versus Aricept? See my blog Natural Alzheimer’s Treatment for some context and my post on other natural remedies: Amla: Indian Gooseberries vs. Cancer, Diabetes, and Cholesterol. If one little flower can do that, what might a diet full of plants achieve? Studies have found less depression among vegetarians, but maybe people who are happier go on to eat healthier rather than the other way around. One can’t prove cause and effect unless you put that to the test too, which was done last year. Researchers found that by removing all meat, fish, poultry, and eggs from people’s diets they could significantly improve mood scores after just two weeks! It can take drugs like Prozac a month or more to take effect. The way drugs like Prozac work is by elevating levels of serotonin, the so-called happiness hormone.  Did you know there’s serotonin in plants? I certainly didn’t, but there’s serotonin, melatonin, dopamine, and all sorts of human neurotransmitters in plants. So much so that there’s been a call to start treating depression with “high-content sources of serotonin” such as pineapples, bananas, kiwis, plums, and tomatoes. And what are the side effects–maybe you’ll get a tomato seed stuck in your teeth or something? For more, check out my videos on the wrong way to boost serotonin by taking potentially dangerous tryptophan supplements, better ways to boost serotonin to fight disorders like premenstrual depression, and perhaps the best way exemplified by findings from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the successful use of butternut squash seeds to treat social anxiety disorder. 	-	Alzheimer's,amla,bananas,depression,dopamine,eggs,fish,kiwis,meat,melatonin,mood,neurotransmitters,pinapples,plums,poultry,premenstrual syndrome,prozac,saffron,serotonin,suicide,tomatoes,tryptophan,vegans,vegetarians	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/17/amla-indian-gooseberries-versus-cancer-diabetes-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/06/natural-alzheimers-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/07/treating-pms-with-saffron/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-vs-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-versus-aricept/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-way-to-boost-serotonin/	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/17/amla-indian-gooseberries-versus-cancer-diabetes-and-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-versus-aricept/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/06/natural-alzheimers-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-vs-prozac/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/07/treating-pms-with-saffron/	
A-401	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/07/treating-pms-with-saffron/	Treating PMS with Saffron	Premenstrual Syndrome is among the most common health problems reported by women, affecting approximately 1 in 3, and there’s not much modern medicine has to offer. Ancient traditional medicine, though, in Asia and Persia used a spice called saffron to treat menstrual disorders. But what did they know–that was 3,500 years ago (in fact the earliest recorded use of any medicinal plant). Didn’t they realize you can’t really know anything unless it’s put through a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial? Well it took 3,500 years, but now we finally have it. Watch my 2-min. video Saffron for the Treatment of PMS to see the results. The spice saffron is composed of the female reproductive organs of the flower of the saffron crocus. Each flower just produces a few threads, such that you need 50,000 flowers to make a single pound of spice–enough flowers to fill a football field. No wonder it’s the most expensive spice in the world. Thankfully, the PMS study found benefits using a tiny amount. What if you could get away with using even less, though? In my 2-min. follow-up video Wake Up and Smell the Saffron I profile one of the wildest studies I saw published last year that documents psychological benefits from even just the scent of saffron. How’s that for the power of plants? The study concludes:  “Smelling saffron… is simple and easy, and it seems there is little side effect.” For more flower power see my blog and videos on hibiscus tea (Better Than Green Tea) and chamomile tea (Red Tea, Honeybush, & Chamomile and Chamomile Tea May Not Be Safe During Pregnancy).

A-402	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/03/05/eating-green-to-prevent-cancer/	Eating Green to Prevent Cancer	Why do people who eat more plants get less cancer? The largest prospective study of diet and cancer in history, for example, found that vegetarians had lower levels of all cancers combined. This could be due to what they eat less of: There are also components of plant foods they are getting more of that can help eliminate excess estrogen; extinguish free radicals; and boost our antioxidant, detoxification, and DNA repair enzymes. What we do eat may be as important as what we don’t eat. The healthiest food is dark green leafy vegetables, which we should ideally eat every day. Greens can improve our eyesight, immune function, athletic performance, and even our physical appearance. The green pigment itself—chlorophyll—may even intercept carcinogens. See my 2-min. video Eating Green to Prevent Cancer, where which I profile a study entitled  “Effects of Chlorophyll on Low-Dose Aflatoxin in Human Volunteers.” Researchers had people drink a solution of radioactive aflatoxin, the carcinogen that used to be a problem in peanut butter, with or without spinach chlorophyll. Check out the video to see the amazing results. For more on protective compounds in plants, check out my 2-min. video Phytochemicals: The Nutrition Facts Missing From the Label. Green pigments are just one sliver of the rainbow though. There are benefits to the yellow ones, orange ones, red ones, and blue ones.

A-403	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/28/what-is-the-healthiest-meat/	What Is the Healthiest Meat?	Thanks to the Chinese space program, scientists in Beijing recently published a formal nutritional analysis of what may be one of the least harmful animals to eat, silkworm caterpillars. As I profile in my 2-min video Good Grub, they appear to have more arginine than soybeans, more zinc than pumpkin seeds, and more protein than snail meat. One pound of powdered worms gets you all the vitamin B12 you need for the day. The big nutritional selling point, though, is their low saturated fat content. Farming insects is also less wasteful than farming other animals. Whereas we waste about 90% of nutrients when we feed grains to cows, less than half the nutrition of edible plants is wasted when we route them through bugs. Okay, but how do they taste? Like octopus, one technical review notes. What’s the downside? See my 2-min. video Bug Appétit: Barriers to Entomophagy. The American space program is going in a different direction. NASA decided on a vegan menu for Mars, realizing, perhaps, that there are safer and cheaper sources of vitamin B12 than a daily pound of powdered worms. What about arginine? Worms, whale meat, pork rinds, and what else? See my 2-min. video Fat Burning Via Arginine. Though sourcing protein from plants is preferable, maggots have been tapped for their potential to improve the safety of the food supply, see my 2-min. video Maggot Meat Spray. 	-	arginine,bugs,grains,insects,maggots,octopus,protein,saturated fat,silkworm caterpillars,snail meat,vegan,vitamin B12,zinc	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bug-appetit-barriers-to-entomophagy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheapest-source-of-vitamin-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bug-appetit-barriers-to-entomophagy/,http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304388004577532952720962114.html?mod=googlenews_wsj#slide/1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-404	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/26/lead-poisoning-risk-from-venison/	Lead Poisoning Risk From Venison	The reason animal products trigger inflammation in the body within hours of consumption is thought to be due to the residual bacterial toxins that survive the cooking process (as l detailed in my blog post How Does Meat Cause Inflammation). The saturated animal fat then helps ferry these endotoxins across the gut wall into our bloodstream. The research team concluded “while the most obvious solution to metabolic endotoxemia appears to be to reduce saturated fat intake, the Western diet is not conducive to this mode of action, and it is difficult for patients to comply with this request.” Thus, researchers have looked to wild animals for less inflammatory meat options. Wild pheasants, for example, have been found to have significantly less saturated fat than farmed pheasants, so one would assume wild pheasant meat would trigger less inflammation. This concept wasn’t put to the test until recently, though. In my 3-min. video Modern Meat Not Ahead of the Game I profile a study performed by a group of Australian researchers that compared the amount of inflammation triggered by domesticated animal meat to wild kangaroo meat. They found that eating kangaroos did trigger an inflammatory response, but not as much as the store-brought meat. This would suggest that venison, for example, would cause less inflammation than chicken, but the way in which the deer is killed makes a difference. See my 2-min. video Filled Full of Lead for the results of a study that raised food safety concerns about conventional ammunition. Note, lead has also been found in protein powder supplements, ayervedic medicine supplements, and other animal products. Like mercury in tuna, no level of lead consumption can be considered safe. For more depth, the inflammatory effects of animal foods are explored in my 3-part video series: Most whole plant foods are anti-inflammatory.

A-405	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/21/the-real-paleo-diet/	The Real Paleo Diet	We evolved eating huge amounts of plants. It’s estimated that 200,000 years ago we got 600mg of vitamin C a day. That’s the amount of vitamin C found in 10 oranges. Every day we appear to have consumed the amount of vitamin E found in 2 cups of nuts, the amount of fiber found in 12 bowls of oatmeal, and the amount of calcium found in 5 cups of collard greens. They weren’t milking mammoths–that came in part from all the wild greens they foraged. As I note in my 2-min. video Paleolithic Lessons, we were exposed to such a quantity of whole healthy plant foods that we, as a species, lost our ability to make vitamin C. We still actually have the vitamin C gene in our DNA, but our bodies presumably just junked it because we were getting such massive daily doses that it wasn’t worth maintaining it. The problems occur when you take our evolutionary heritage, fine-tuned over the millennia, and plop it down into meat and potato chip country. Advocates of the so-called Paleo diet are certainly right in railing against refined and processed junk, but may just use it as an excuse to eat loads of meat that bears little resemblance to flesh of prehistoric wild animals. The contaminant issue alone is compelling reason to eat as low as possible on the food chain. As I show in the video, the journal of the American Meat Science Association recently published a review cataloging the laundry list: arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, preservatives, and veterinary drugs such as antibiotic residues. Given what’s now in fish, for example, “it would be impossible to follow the Paleolithic diet while avoiding the risks associated with consuming mercury in amounts in excess of the suggested EPA threshold.” The “paleo” diet patients I saw in my practice weren’t consuming weeds and eating in excess of 100 grams of fiber a day. They were eating burgers, not bugs. As concluded in a review I profile in the video, “Sufficient scientific evidence exists for public health policy to promote a plant-rich diet for health promotion.” For those interested in digging deeper, there was an interesting Scientific American blog this summer entitled “Human Ancestors Were Nearly All Vegetarians” and there’s an in-depth video series on YouTube debunking the paleo diet fad. I wrote a whole book on the Atkins incarnation, Carbophobia, now available free online. I also have two videos on low carb diets: Atkins Diet: Trouble Keeping It Up and Plant-Based Atkins Diet. 	-	antibiotic residues,arsenic,bugs,burgers,cadmium,calcium,collard greens,contaminants,DNA,fiber,junk food,lead,meat,mercury,nuts,oatmeal,oranges,paleo diet,plants,preservatives,vitamin C,vitamin E	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-atkins-diet/	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590560868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590560868,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://www.youtube.com/user/PrimitiveNutrition,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleolithic-lessons/,http://www.atkinsexposed.org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/07/23/human-ancestors-were-nearly-all-vegetarians/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-atkins-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-406	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/19/how-much-soy-is-too-much/	How Much Soy is Too Much?	If animal proteins promote cancer because they boost our blood levels of the growth hormone IGF-1, what about the few plant proteins that have amino acid ratios similar to animal proteins such soy foods? One of soy’s selling points is that it has “high quality” protein, but as I explored in my video Higher Quality May Mean Higher Risk, higher quality protein may mean a higher risk of cancer. In my 2-min. video Animalistic Plant Proteins, I show that animal protein consumption is associated with significantly higher levels of the cancer promoter IGF-1 and non-soy plant protein is associated with significantly lower levels. There was no significant association with soy protein, though. This suggests that if all we do is replace animal protein with soy protein, we may not see as dramatic a drop in IGF-1 as that enjoyed by those replacing meat, eggs, and dairy with a variety of plant proteins. You can see what lower IGF-1 levels can mean for prostate and breast cancer growth in my videos Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay and The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle. In my 3-min. video Too Much Soy May Neutralize Benefits I show that vegans consuming the equivalent of 7-18 servings of soy foods per day may end up with circulating IGF-1 levels comparable to those who eat meat. For more on the cancer reversal study mentioned in the video, see Cancer Reversal Through Diet. It’s important to remember in this discussion that soy food consumption is associated with an array of health benefits. See, for example The Effect of Soy On Precocious Puberty and Soy Foods & Menopause. But how much may be too much? It seems that 7 to 18 servings of soy a day may neutralize some of the beneficial effects of avoiding animal protein. At the same time, studies have repeatedly found that women who eat a lot of soy appear to have a lower risk of getting breast cancer and a better chance of surviving breast cancer than those who don’t (see Breast Cancer Survival and Soy). So is there some magic number of soyfood servings we should shoot for? In my 2-min. video, How Much Soy Is Too Much, I run through all the studies to date that have measured the effects of varying levels of soy consumption on IGF-1 levels. Five to ten servings per day increased IGF-1 levels, but two to three servings did not. The bottom-line is that legumes are one of the healthiest things we can eat and should be a part of everyone’s daily diet. This means lentils, peas, and/or beans every day—in fact, ideally every meal! Soy is an excellent choice, but we should probably stick to no more than 3-5 servings a day. 	-	amino acid,animal proteins,breast cancer,cancer,dairy,eggs,high quality protein,IGF-1,legumes,meat,Nathan Pritikin,plant proteins,prostate cancer,soy,soy protein,vegans	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytoestrogens/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animalistic-plant-proteins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-foods-menopause/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animalistic-plant-proteins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-soy-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-foods-menopause/	
A-407	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/12/less-cancer-in-vegan-men-despite-more-testosterone/	Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer	Just a few days of walking and eating healthy plant foods can lower the level of the cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1 enough to reverse cancer cell growth in a Petri dish. This is detailed in my last three blog posts Cancer-Proofing Your Body, Treating an Enlarged Prostate With Diet, and How do Plant-Based Diets Fight Cancer? We know decreasing animal product consumption decreases our IGF-1 levels, but how low do we have to go? How plant-based does our diet need to get? In my 2-min. video How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1? the IGF-1 levels are compared between men and women eating conventional, vegetarian, and vegan diets. Vegan men tended to have significantly higher testosterone levels than both vegetarians and meateaters (see graph here), which can be a risk factor for prostate cancer, the reason plant-based diets appear to reverse the progression of prostate cancer may be due to how low their IGF-1 drops (see Cancer Reversal Through Diet?). Boosting cancer defenses within just days of eating healthy is a remarkable finding. For those interested in the whole story, I started out introducing Nathan Pritikin and the elegant series of experiments that became part of his legacy. Researchers were able to demonstrate the mechanism by which a plant-based diet and exercise could suppress the growth of breast and prostate cancer cells and protect against prostate enlargement (more on prostate problems in Some Prostates are Larger Than Others and Prostate Versus Plants). I also asked and answered Is It the Diet, the Exercise, or Both? Finally, for those interested in whether lower levels of growth hormones in vegans might interfere with the accumulation of muscle mass, see my 3-min. video Plant-Based Bodybuilding. 	-	animal products,cancer,IGF-1,prostate cancer,testosterone,vegan men,vegans,vegetarians	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/05/treating-an-enlarged-prostate-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/31/cancer-proofing-your-body/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/07/how-do-plant-based-diets-fight-cancer/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-bodybuilding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-prostates-are-larger-than-others/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-a-plant-based-diet/	http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/9/2257.full.pdf+html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/05/treating-an-enlarged-prostate-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-bodybuilding/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/some-prostates-are-larger-than-others/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/31/cancer-proofing-your-body/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/07/how-do-plant-based-diets-fight-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-a-plant-based-diet/	
A-408	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/07/how-do-plant-based-diets-fight-cancer/	How Do Plant-Based Diets Fight Cancer?	Why do centenarians—those who live to be over a hundred years old—escape cancer? As you can see in my 3-min. video IGF-1 as One-Stop Cancer Shop, as we get older our risk of getting and dying from cancer grows year by year until we hit about 85 or 90, and then cancer risk starts to drop. It seems that centenarians are endowed with a particular resistance to cancer. So what’s their secret? Every day, 50 billion of our cells die, and every day, 50 billion new ones are born. There’s a balance. Otherwise your body would shrink or get too crowded. Sometimes we need grow, like when we’re a baby or for that growth spurt around puberty. Our cells don’t get larger when we grow up; they increase in number. A child’s hand may only be made up of about 50 billion cells and may have to add half trillion or so while growing up. Once we’re all grown up, though, we don’t want a lot of extra cells hanging around. We still need our cells to grow and divide, but out with the old and in with the new. We don’t want to be making more cells than we’re putting out to pasture. When you’re a kid, extra growth can be good; when you’re an adult, extra growth can mean a tumor. How do our cells know when to tip the scale in favor of more dividing with less dying and when to come back into balance? A key signal is IGF-1, a growth hormone called insulin-like growth factor number one. IGF-1 levels go up when you’re a kid so you grow and then come back down when you’re done growing. Should your levels stay a bit too high as an adult, though, there’s a constant message sent to your cells to grow, grow, grow, divide, don’t die, keep going, keep growing. Not surprisingly, the more IGF-1 we have in our bloodstream, the higher our risk for many types of cancer. When you’re a kid, growth is good, but too much growth when we’re all grown up can mean cancer. In my 90-second video, Cancer-Proofing Mutation, I describe Laron Syndrome, a type of dwarfism caused by congenital IGF-1 deficiency. Those affected don’t have that IGF-1 spurt in childhood so they grow up short-statured, but not having an excess of IGF-1 in their systems as an adult makes them nearly cancer-proof. This raises the question of whether one can achieve the best of both worlds by ensuring adequate IGF-1 levels during childhood and then suppressing excess growth promotion in adulthood. This can be done with a plant-based diet as I described in my last blog posts Cancer-Proofing Your Body and Treating an Enlarged Prostate With Diet, as well as in my 4-min. video The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle. Who is Pritikin? See Engineering a Cure. What’s the puzzle? See Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay. The binding protein findings I describe in the video may explain the findings in Is It the Diet, the Exercise, or Both? For more on IGF-1, I’ve touched on it before in Dairy Hormonal Interference and Meat Hormones & Female Infertility. 	-	cancer,centenarians,dwarfism,IGF-1,insulin,Nathan Pritikin,tumor	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/31/cancer-proofing-your-body/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-hormonal-interference/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-proofing-mutation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-hormones-female-infertility/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-hormonal-interference/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/31/cancer-proofing-your-body/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-proofing-mutation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/05/treating-an-enlarged-prostate-with-diet	
A-409	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/02/05/treating-an-enlarged-prostate-with-diet/	Treating an Enlarged Prostate With Diet	The majority of American men will develop a pathologically enlarged prostate gland (also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH). The good news, though, is that like many other epidemics of chronic disease plaguing the Western world, it can be prevented and treated with a plant-based diet. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra as it exits the bladder. If the gland gets too big it can constrict the normal flow of urine. Men can be left with a hesitant, weak urine stream, dribbling, irritation, and inadequate emptying of the bladder requiring multiple nightly trips to the bathroom. In the United States, it affects about 50% of men in their 50′s and 80% of men in their 80′s, but as I note in my 3-min. video Some Prostates Are Larger than Others it’s extremely rare in certain populations and diet may be to blame for our BPH epidemic. What if you already have it though? According to a recent review I profile in my 3-min. video, Prostate Versus Plants, the most notable development in the epidemic of prostate enlargement and lower urinary tract symptoms is the recognition that modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet can substantially influence the progression of the disease. All men should consider eating a prostate-healthy diet that includes legumes (beans, peas, lentils, soy); certain vegetables (like garlic and onions); and certain seeds (flax seeds); and avoids refined grains, eggs, and poultry. If individual plant foods reduce the risk of prostate enlargement, what about an entire diet composed of plant foods? In my last blog post, Cancer-Proofing Your Body, I showed how a healthy diet can slow down the abnormal growth of prostate cancer cells, but what about the abnormal growth of normal prostate cells? In a similar series of experiments researchers took a bunch of men and put them on a plant-based diet for 2 weeks. Then they dripped the mens’ blood on prostate cells growing in a petri dish and saw, as with the cancer, a significant drop in growth. As I detail in my video Prostate Versus a Plant-Based Diet not only do prostate cell growth rates drop almost immediately upon adopting a healthier diet, but follow-up studies on men eating plant-based diets for up to 28 years straight show that as long as one continues to eat healthy, prostate cell growth rates go down and they stay down.

A-410	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/31/cancer-proofing-your-body/	Cancer-Proofing Your Body	Lifestyle medicine pioneer Nathan Pritikin was an unlikely candidate to spark a nutrition revolution. He wasn’t a doctor or dietician but an engineer. As featured in my 2-min. NutritionFacts.org video Engineering a Cure, he reversed his own heart disease with a plant-based diet and went on to help millions of others. He even saved the life of my own grandmother, which is what inspired me to go into medicine. Pritikin’s work has continued though his research foundation. Once Dean Ornish proved that Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped, the focus shifted from heart disease to cancer. In my 3-min. video Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay, I describe an elegant series of experiments in which people were placed on different diets and their blood was then dripped on cancer cells in a petri dish to see which diet was more effective at suppressing cancer growth. As you can see in the video, even the blood of those on a standard American diet (S.A.D.) fights cancer, but the blood of those on vegan diets fights about 8 times better. The blood circulating within the bodies of vegans appears to have nearly 8 times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth. That was after maintaining a plant-based diet for a year though. Subsequent studies against breast cancer showed the power of eating plants for just two weeks. Watch The Answer to the Pritikin Puzzle to see the remarkable results. This dramatic strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plant-based diet and exercise—they were out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day. Although Pritikin started out reversing chronic disease through diet alone, later—to his credit—he added an exercise component as well. That’s great for the patients, but scientifically it makes it hard to tease out which intervention is doing what. Maybe the only reason their blood started becoming so effective at suppressing cancer growth was because of the exercise—maybe the diet component had nothing to do with it. This had to be put to the test. In my 4-min. video Is It the Diet, the Exercise, or Both? I describe the experiment. Three groups were compared: a plant-based diet and exercise group, an exercise only group, and a control group that did neither. The diet and exercise group had been on a plant-based diet for 14 years along with moderate exercise as simple as walking every day. The second group was exercise and hardcore exercise at that: 14 years of daily, strenuous, hour-long exercise like calisthenics, but they ate the standard American diet. Which group was better at fighting cancer? The researchers took petri dishes brimming full of human prostate cancer cells and dripped blood from each of the three groups on different dishes to see whose blood killed off more cancer. Watch the diet vs. exercise video to see actual photomicrographs of the effects on cancer cells. Basically they found that strenuous exercise helped, but nothing appeared to kick more cancer butt than a healthy diet. Even though diet appears more powerful than exercise in terms of rallying one’s cancer defenses it doesn’t mean we can’t do both. In fact eating certain plants may even improve athletic performance—check out my video series that starts with Doping With Beet Juice and ends with So Should We Drink Beet Juice Or Not?. 	-	beet juice,cancer,Dean Ornish,exercise,heart disease,Nathan Pritikin,Standard American Diet,vegan diets	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resuscitating-medicare/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/engineering-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resuscitating-medicare/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doping-with-beet-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/so-should-we-drink-beet-juice-or-not/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-it-the-diet-the-exercise-or-both/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-411	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/29/vegan-workplace-intervention/	Plant-Based Workplace Intervention	A billion people in the world are now overweight. That’s great news for the $13 billion weight loss supplement industry, but as I detailed in my 2-min. video Diet Pills Do a Fat Lot of Good, a recent review of common slimming supplements versus placebo concluded that none of them worked any better than the sugar pills. Unfortunately this lack of efficacy is not just limited to weight loss supplements despite what one might be told in a natural food store. See my videos: Recently a similar conclusion about diet pills was reached by the Weight Management Center at Johns Hopkins concluding, “it is fitting to highlight that perhaps the most general and safest ‘alternative’ approach to weight control is to substitute low-energy density foods for high-energy density and processed foods, thereby reducing total energy intake.” In other words, more whole plant foods and fewer animals and junk. The Hopkins paper continues: “By taking advantage of the low-energy density and health-promoting effects of plant-based foods, one may be able to achieve weight loss, or at least assist weight maintenance without cutting down on the volume of food consumed or compromising its nutrient value.” The Physician’s Committee for Responsible Medicine decided to put this idea to work in a workplace dietary intervention study at GEICO corporate headquarters. Compared to a control worksite where employees were kept in the dark, employees were educated about the wonders of a plant-based diet for a couple months along with a few healthier options in the cafeteria without changes in exercise. Check out my 2-min. video Slimming the Gecko for the results!

A-412	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/24/biblical-daniel-fast-tested/	Biblical Daniel Fast Tested	Researchers recently set out to replicate the “Daniel Fast,” the biblical nutrition trial outlined in Daniel 1:8-16. In my last blog post Poultry Paunch, I featured results from the EPIC study, one of the largest studies ever performed. The gold standard, however, is an interventional study where you put people on a certain diet and track what happens. It’s easy to get people to make little changes, but increasingly we’re seeing evidence that to see big changes in our health, we need to make big changes in our diet. Moderation kills: check out my videos Heart Attacks and Cholesterol: Dying Under Normal Circumstances and Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. People who want to lower their risk can certainly tweak their diet, but those who want to eliminate their risk or reverse disease really have to take healthy eating seriously. How are public health professionals going to get folks to commit to a healthy diet? Maybe by telling them the bible told them so. In Daniel, Chapter 1, verses 8-16, the prophet best known for his lion’s den rather than his budding role as nutritional scientist resolved not to defile himself with the king’s meat. When this was met with resistance, Daniel proposed a test: round up some test subjects, put them on a plant-based diet, and see how they do. And what do you know! They ended up looking healthier and better nourished, so Daniel got to stick to his veggies. As I note in my 2-min. video Tightening the Bible Belt, though the King James version uses the word “vegetables,” the original Hebrew version can translate into a broader definition. 2700 years later, researchers at the University of Memphis decided it was time to try to replicate the study. Watch my 2-min. video Biblical Daniel Fast Put to the Test to find out the results. Can the drop in biomarkers of inflammation they found in the study actually translate into an improvement in inflammatory disease progression though? See Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease and Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis. The decrease in inflammation is likely a combination of the anti-inflammatory effects of many plant foods (Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell) and the pro-inflammatory effects of animal foods (see the 3-video series ending with Dead Meat Bacteria Endotoxemia). The improvement in antioxidant capacity is also not unexpected given the different Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. 	-	antioxidants,Bible,Daniel,diet,disease,EPIC study,inflammation,plant-based diet,poultry,University of Memphis	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biblical-daniel-fast-put-to-the-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-dying-under-normal-circumstances/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tightening-the-bible-belt/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/22/poultry-paunch-meat-weight-gain,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-dying-under-normal-circumstances/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/biblical-daniel-fast-put-to-the-test/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tightening-the-bible-belt/	
A-413	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/22/poultry-paunch-meat-weight-gain/	Poultry Paunch: Meat & Weight Gain	Meat is considered fattening due to its caloric density and fat content, but nuts are also packed with calories and fat. As I noted in a previous post, Nuts Don’t Cause Expected Weight Gain, so maybe we shouldn’t presume. As you can see in my 3-min. video Meat and Weight Gain in the PANACEA Study, one of the largest nutrition studies ever performed put the question of meat and weight gain to the test. Not only was meat consumption significantly associated with weight gain in both men and women, the link remained even after controlling for calories. That means if you have two people eating the same amount of calories, the person eating the most meat would gain more weight. The researchers even calculated how much more and which meat was associated with the most weight gain above and beyond the caloric content. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association was not happy about these findings. As I detail in my 2-min. video Cattlemen’s Association Has Beef With EPIC Study, a meat industry representative argued that the pounds that the meat-eaters packed on may have been muscle mass, not fat. Maybe they were becoming beefier, not fatter. Fine, the researcher responded, they’d rerun the numbers to not just measure obesity, but abdominal obesity–the worst kind. They took a small sample out of the study, a sample of 91,214 people (that’s how big the study was!) and found the exact same thing. Even when eating the same number of calories, the more meat we eat the more our belly grows. They could even calculate how much our waistline would be expected to expand based on our daily meat consumption. Now folks can plan ahead for the new pants they’ll need to buy! Although nothing comes close to the EPIC study in scale, other recent studies I feature in the video found the same thing. For more findings from the EPIC study see any of the following videos: For more on abdominal fat, see: And check out my last blog post Diet vs. Exercise: What’s More Important? for what may be the best way to measure abdominal obesity–the waist-to-height ratio. 	-	calories,EPIC study,meat,National Cattlemen's Beef Association,nuts,weight gain	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/27/nuts-dont-cause-expected-weight-gain/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cattlemens-association-has-beef-with-epic-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cattlemens-association-has-beef-with-epic-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/27/nuts-dont-cause-expected-weight-gain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/17/diet-vs-exercise-whats-more-important,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-414	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/17/diet-vs-exercise-whats-more-important/	Diet vs. Exercise: What’s More Important?	When trying to lose weight, which is most important: diet or exercise? The vast majority of those surveyed believe that both monitoring food and beverage consumption and physical activity are equally important in weight maintenance and weight loss. After equally important, people go with exercise, and then diet. As you can see in my 2-min. video Diet vs. Exercise for Weight Loss, most people get it wrong. Note the caloric expenditure equivalencies I present in the video are assuming no dietary compensation–something seen quite dramatically, for example, with nut consumption. Given how hard it is to work off food, let’s make our calories count by choosing the most nutrient dense foods, as detailed in my 4-min. video Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score. Another misconception is that weight alone is a good predictor of disease risk. Body mass index is better since it takes height into account, but it doesn’t describe what or where that mass is. Body-builders can have huge BMIs (especially since muscle is heavier than fat), but that doesn’t mean they’re obese. As I document in my 2-min. video Keep Your Waist Circumference to Less Than Half Your Height, it is now accepted that health risks can be determined as much by the relative distribution of the excess fat as by its total amount. It’s not so much body fat, but visceral fat–abdominal fat, the fat around our internal organs–that most increases our risk of dying prematurely. Waist circumference takes care of both the “what” and “where” of the weight, so the best metric may be waist-to-height ratio. Move over BMI; we now have WHR. The target is to keep our waist circumference to less than half our height. Take a cloth measuring tape and measure halfway between the top of your hipbones and the bottom of your ribcage. Stand up straight, breathe deep, exhale, let it all hang out and that measurement should be half our height. If it’s not, we should consider cutting down on our consumption of meat, as I cover in my video Meat and Weight Gain in the PANACEA Study. It may also help to cut back on refined plant foods, such as white flour products. Three servings a day of whole grains, however, was recently associated with a slimmer waist in the Framingham Heart Study. 	-	BMI,body mass index,exercise,weight loss,WHR	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keep-your-waist-circumference-to-less-than-half-your-height/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-or-exercise-whats-more-important-for-weight-loss/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-and-weight-gain-in-the-panacea-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/keep-your-waist-circumference-to-less-than-half-your-height/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-or-exercise-whats-more-important-for-weight-loss/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-415	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/15/the-ice-diet/	The Ice Diet	Other than fiber, what else do plants make that animals don’t that could help account for how dramatically slimmer those who eat plant-based diets tend to be? In my last post Boosting Gut Flora Without Probiotics I covered fiber. In my 2-min. video Tipping Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes I cover phytonutrients and why it’s sometimes better to not absorb them. If phytonutrients can alter gut flora in a way that helps people lose weight, then you’d think people eating diets based on plants would have significantly different colon populations. Indeed, that’s something that’s been known for four decades, and may help explain why those eating such diets tend to be slimmer. Another reason plant-based diets have been tied to better weight management may be the water content of plant foods. Fruits and vegetables average 80 to 90 percent water. Just as fiber can bulk up the volume of foods without adding calories, so can water. Cognitive experiments have shown that people tend to eat a certain volume of food, and when that volume is mostly water they don’t end up gaining as much weight. Even if you take out the visual component and instead stick a tube down people’s throats to feed them whatever volumes of food you want, if you add more water to their stomach they tend to eat less. Perhaps this is due to the stretch receptors in their stomachs sending signals to their brains saying we’ve had enough. If water is so helpful, why can’t you just eat that steak and drink a glass of water? As you can see in my 3-min. video The Ice Diet, it doesn’t work. You feel more full during the meal, but you end up eating the same number of calories throughout the day, unless, they’ve found, you preload. Drinking water with the meal doesn’t seem to help control calories, but drinking a big glass of water a half hour before a meal might. Ice water may be even better–or just ice. Water has zero calories, but ice has less than zero since our bodies have to warm it up. The Annals of Internal Medicine published a letter called “The Ice Diet.” Using simple thermodynamic calculations of how much heat our body would have to generate to take an ice cube up to body temperature, the authors concluded that eating a quart of ice–like a really, really big snow cone with no syrup–could rob our body of more than 150 calories. That’s the “same amount of energy as the calorie expenditure in running 1 mile.” Sound too good to be true? It is actually, as Ray Cronice talks about in his body hacking work with thermogenics, you may just be diverting some of the body’s waste heat. If you really want to use chronic mild cold stress to lose weight, turning down one’s thermostat or wearing fewer layers outside may be more effective in the long-run than drinking slushies of slush. 	-	colon,fiber,firmicutes,fruits,gut flora,phytonutrients,vegan,vegetables,vegetarian	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/10/boosting-gut-flora-without-probiotics/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-ice-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5566425,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-ice-diet/,http://hypothermics.com/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/tipping-the-balance-of-firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/10/boosting-gut-flora-without-probiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-416	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/10/boosting-gut-flora-without-probiotics/	Boosting Gut Flora without Probiotics	Obesity is so rare among those eating plant-based diets (see my video Thousands of Vegans Studied), nutrition researchers have been desperate to uncover their secret. Yes, they tend to eat fewer calories, but not that many fewer. In the past I’ve made videos about a couple of the theories that have emerged. Maybe because people eating plant-strong diets express more of the fat shoveling enzyme inside the power plants—the mitochondria–within our cells (How to Upregulate Metabolism). Maybe it’s because they grow different populations of good bacteria in their gut (Gut Flora & Obesity). Maybe it’s because they’re avoiding the endocrine disrupting industrial pollutants in the meat supply. An Obesity-Causing Chicken Virus may even be contributing. We’re still not sure, but the theories keep coming. Maybe it’s the propionate, an anti-obesity compound made by our gut bacteria when we feed them fiber. Watch my 2-min. video Fawning Over Flora for details. Our friendly flora’s digestion of fiber also yields another short chain fatty acid called butyrate, which appears to protect against colon cancer. Butyrate may also explain why fiber-filled plant-based diets are so anti-inflammatory. A recent review concluded that “butyrate seems to exert broad anti-inflammatory activities and might be [a] good candidate to evaluate in the fight against obesity-associated and systemic inflammation in general.” See my coverage of that review in my 1-min. video Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics. Since butyrate is a byproduct of fiber digestion, we can boost its production by eating more plant foods, and we can boost the number of butyrate-producing bacteria in our colon by really eating more plant foods–those eating vegetarian harbor more butyrate-producing bacteria.

The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share as gifts, but there’s nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up online free here at NutritionFacts.org. The Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 12 DVD is available now with all proceeds going to keep NutritionFacts.org operational. If you’re in need of catching up, I’ve packaged the first ten volumes into a 12-disc DVD set. Here’s the list of chapters off the new volume 12 DVD — a preview of what’s to come here on NutritionFacts.org: Order the new DVD on my website or through Amazon. January 1st marked the 500th day of his website’s existence. My heartfelt gratitude to all those who joined in the outpouring of support to keep NutritionFacts.org up and running. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to raise enough to keep the site going at full capacity, which is why this is the first day since NutritionFacts.org started that there is no video-of-the-day. In 2013, new videos will only appear every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday — but I’m going to start writing two blog posts a week, on Tuesday and Thursday, so if you’re subscribed to daily video and news updates you’ll still be able to enjoy new content every day. 	-	DVD	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/donors/,http://smile.amazon.com/Latest-Clinical-Nutrition-Michael-Greger/dp/B00AT07OSC/ref=pd_sim_mov_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0V22JW0C96M9H91AHJRZ&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AT07OSC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00AT07OSC">Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 12</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpwwwdrgreg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00AT07OSC,http://smile.amazon.com/Latest-Clinical-Nutrition-volumes-twelve/dp/B008OKSMK8/ref=pd_sim_mov_8?ie=UTF8&refRID=0VTMMNVREV657ZDA72BS&tag=httpwwwdrgreg-20,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/10/11/vol-11-nutrition-dvd-now-available-proceeds-to-charity/,http://www.drgreger.org/DVDs,http://nutritionfacts.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c1bae6687e1e6ab175fb56913&id=40f9e497d1	
A-418	http://nutritionfacts.org/2013/01/03/burning-fat-with-flavonoids/	Burning Fat With Flavonoids 	Nuts appear to boost one’s metabolism, such that when we eat nuts we burn more of our own fat to compensate. In my 2-min. video, Testing the Fat Burning Theory, I show that people who don’t eat nuts tend to burn off around 20 grams of fat a day–about 5 pats worth of butter, but those eating walnuts averaged more like 31 grams–7 or 8 pats of butter. In Fat Burning Via Arginine, I explore one theory as to why this may happen (and where arginine can be found in our diet). It may also be the flavonoids, phytonutrients found in nuts as well as citrus, berries, red onions, beans, green tea, grapes, and cocoa, that may boost our metabolism enough to significantly slim our waistline. Based on what kind of evidence? I showcase a study done on purple grape juice in my video Fat Burning Via Flavonoids. Just like nuts are calorically dense yet don’t seem to cause much weight gain, Welch’s was hoping that the same would be found for their grape juice. They had people guzzle down 2 cups a day for three months. Keep in mind that Welch’s grape juice has more sugar than Coca Cola. Two cups of purple grape juice contain the equivalent of 20 spoonfuls of sugar. The control group was basically given grape Kool-Aid instead, with the same number of calories and same amount of sugar, but no detectable phytonutrients. At two cups a day study subjects were getting hundreds of extra calories a day. Surely after 3 months they’d gain a couple pounds. Indeed that’s what happened in the grape-flavored sugar water group—how could they not with all that extra sugar in their diet? The grape juice group, on the other hand, did not. In fact, their waist circumference shrunk significantly. Drinking grape juice appeared to burn away significantly more tummy fat. So maybe there is something to the theory put forth by the nut and green tea researchers that flavonoid phytonutrients are capable of helping the body burn fat. If true, then it’s just one more reason to eat nuts and drink green tea—not grape juice. Instead of the juice, I’d recommend eating concord grapes, the source of purple grape juice that you may be able to find at a farmer’s market near you. 	-	arginine,flavonoids,grape juice,metabolism,nuts,sugar,walnuts	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/	
A-419	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/27/nuts-dont-cause-expected-weight-gain/	Nuts Don't Cause Expected Weight Gain	Nuts are packed with nutrition, but they are also packed with calories. Why, then, don’t nuts seem to make people fat?  In my video Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence, I profile a review published back in 2007 looking at about 20 clinical trials that had been done on nuts and weight. Not a single one showed the weight gain one would expect. All of the studies either showed less weight gain than predicted, no weight gain at all, or actual weight loss—even after study subjects added a handful or two of nuts per day to their diet. However, the studies lasted just a few weeks or months. What about long-term? Maybe in the short run nuts don’t lead to weight gain as much as other foods, but what about after years of eating nuts? Well that’s been examined six different ways in studies lasting up to eight years. One found no significant change and the other five out of six measures found significantly less weight gain and risk of abdominal obesity in those eating more nuts. Since that review is now 5 years old, in my Weight of Evidence video I update it to include all of the studies published since, including a number published this year. For example, in 2012 there was study in which people added over a hundred pistachios to their daily diets for three months and didn’t gain a pound. How did 30,000 calories disappear? What happened to the missing calories? The mystery has been solved. In my video series that started with Solving the Mystery of the Missing Calories, I presented the “pistachio principle” and the fecal excretion theory.  In my next video these theories were put to the test.  I then explored the Dietary Compensation Theory, and by the final video in the series we had figured it out. Part of the trick seemed to be that nuts boost fat burning within the body. But how? It could have something to do with the amino acid arginine (see my 2-min. video Fat Burning via Arginine) or the phytonutrients found in nuts and green tea (Fat Burning via Flavonoids). Since nut consumption has been associated with lower rates of heart disease and living a longer life we should include them in our regular diet without worrying that they’re going to make us fat. 	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/11/08/magnesium-to-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/11/08/magnesium-to-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-flavonoids/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fat-burning-via-arginine/	
A-420	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/20/best-phytosterol-dose-and-source/	Optimal Phytosterol Dose and Source	Fiber bulks, speeds, and dilutes the intestinal waste stream to facilitate the removal of excess cholesterol from our bodies, as described in my video Nuts and Bolts of Cholesterol Lowering. This mechanism is similar to how “normal” levels of fiber consumption (huge by modern standards) relieve the body of excess estrogen . Fiber also helps improve intestinal transit time (Stool Size Matters!) and protects against diverticulosis. Fiber is one of the reasons why nut consumption is associated with lower cholesterol levels (see my last post Cholesterol Lowering in a Nut Shell). Another reason may be phytosterols. The ability of phytosterols in plant foods to reduce cholesterol levels was first reported more than 80 years ago. The same trash-picker analogy used to explain the effects of fiber on cholesterol in the video above can help us understand how phytosterols work. Just as phytoestrogens in plants can have an anti-estrogenic effect by fooling your body into trying to use them instead of your own estrogen–which is a thousand times stronger, phytosterols are plant-based cholesterol look-alikes found predominantly in nuts and seeds. See my 2-min. video How Phytosterols Lower Cholesterol for an illustration comparing the two. When we eat nuts and seeds, phytosterols progress through our ever-flowing waste stream where the trash-picking cells lining our gut throw them into their bins along with the actual cholesterol molecules. Their bins can only hold so much, though, before they have to go empty it into the body before coming back to the banks of our fecal flow. Thus, if there’s just cholesterol in the waste stream, that’s what fills up the bin, but if there’s phytosterols too then half the bin may be filled with cholesterol and half with phytosterols. This leaves the other half’s worth of cholesterol to flush out to sea. It’s only once the phytosterols are absorbed that our body realizes the mistake it’s made and dumps them back down the trash chute. Trash pickers further down the line may accidently pick them back up again and repeat the process. In the end (or out the end!), because we swallowed all those phytosterols into our gut, less excess cholesterol gets reabsorbed and, instead, ends up getting dumped. In my 2-min. video Optimal Phytosterol Dose I show that there’s a plateau effect, though. The cholesterol-blocking effects of phytosterols max out at around 2000 mg, but most people have a long way to go to reach that. The standard American diet may provide as few as 78mg per day. Plant-based diets provide the most phytosterols; nonetheless, there’s still room to improve. Those who have bettered their diet so much that they’re no longer eating any cholesterol should be acing their cholesterol tests, but, in rare cases in which your body might not be able to get rid of enough self-made cholesterol, what is the best source of phytosterols? In my 2-min. video Optimal Phytosterol Source I note the irony that phytosterols are typically prescribed in butter-form, fortified spreads such as Benecol. Studies show that smaller more frequent doses may be more effective than one big dose in a spread or pill. This makes sense given the trash-picker analogy. We want to have phytosterols constantly flowing through our gut throughout the day so they‘ll continue to keep stuffing the bins of our intestinal lining cells, causing excess cholesterol to pass. Another reason that phytosterol supplements may not work as well is that we need fat to optimally absorb phytosterols. That’s why they package them into margarine spreads, yet nature put phytosterols right where we need them–in nuts and seeds that have more than enough fat. There now exists phytosterol-fortified orange juice and lemonade, but like the pills, we would not expect phytosterols to be as effectively absorbed due to the lack of fat. The best source of phytosterols is whole plant foods: seeds provide the most—especially sesame (see the chart here), then nuts—especially pistachio, then legumes such as peanuts. 	-	cholesterol,estrogen,fiber,nuts,phytosterol	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/13/cholesterol-lowering-in-a-nut-shell/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-bolts-of-cholesterol-lowering/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-source/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diverticulosis-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-phytosterols-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-bolts-of-cholesterol-lowering/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-source/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-phytosterol-dose/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diverticulosis-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/13/cholesterol-lowering-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-phytosterols-lower-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	
A-421	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/13/cholesterol-lowering-in-a-nut-shell/	Cholesterol Lowering in a Nut Shell	Though official recommendations are to first treat high cholesterol with dietary change, many physicians jump right to cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins like Lipitor that can have an array of side effects. As described in my 1-min. video Diet Versus Drugs for High Cholesterol, up to a third of patients prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs experience adverse reactions. Side effects include liver, muscle, and kidney dysfunction, skin disorders, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, dizziness, flushing, neurological disorders, and cognitive impairment. Dietary and lifestyle changes, on the other hand, tend to carry positive side effects. That’s why they are the cornerstones of the American Heart Association guidelines. Recommendations include reduced intake of saturated fat and cholesterol with increased physical activity and intake of dietary fiber. Basically we need to eat fewer animal foods, the only source of cholesterol, and more plants, the only source of fiber. One plant food that may be particularly protective is nuts. See Nuts and Bolts of Cholesterol Lowering for a pooled analysis of studies on nut consumption, cholesterol levels, and risk of death from heart disease. For more on reducing cholesterol, the #1 risk factor for our #1 cause of death, see:  For preventing our other top killers, see Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death.

A-422	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/12/06/the-true-shelf-life-of-cooking-oils/	The True Shelf Life of Cooking Oils	Cooking oil manufacturer “best-by” dates were recently put to the test by comparing the development of rancidity between almond oil, avocado oil, hazelnut oil, macadamia oil, grape seed oil, rice bran oil, toasted sesame oil, and walnut oil. Find out which oil starts going rancid within just a few weeks in my video The True Shelf-Life of Cooking Oils. The best way to keep and consume walnut oil is, of course, within the walnut itself. In my video What Women Should Eat to Live Longer I noted that the Harvard Nurses Health Study found that eating just two handfuls of nuts per week may extend a woman’s lifespan as much as four hours of weekly jogging. No reason you can’t do both though! :) Which kinds of walnuts are best? Black walnuts or English—also known as common—walnuts? I would have guessed black just based on their rich flavor and color, but I would have been wrong. In a study I profile in my 2-min. video Black Versus English Walnuts, when subjects were given a salami and cheese sandwich on white bread smeared with 2 spoonfuls of butter and then a big handful of either black or English walnuts, something very different happened. When we whack our arteries with that kind of load of saturated animal fat, within hours our blood vessels become inflamed and stiff. Eating English—but not black—walnuts with the salami sandwich appeared to diminish the damage, which perhaps relates to the finding that English walnuts have nearly 10 times the antioxidant capacity of black walnuts. The anti-inflammatory power of certain nuts is really quite astonishing. See my video Fighting Inflammation in a Nutshell as well as Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease for other anti-inflammatory strategies. I explore why animal foods may be so inflammatory in my three part video series: I also give an abbreviated summary of it in my full-length “live” presentation Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-true-shelf-life-of-cooking-oils/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/black-versus-english-walnuts,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-true-shelf-life-of-cooking-oils/	
A-423	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/11/29/ractopamine-and-yersinia-drugs-and-bugs-in-pork/	Ractopamine and Yersinia in U.S. Pork	Earlier this year, China rejected 200,000 pounds of pork from the United States after discovering residues in the meat of an adrenaline-like drug called ractopamine, which is fed to U.S. pigs (Paylean™) and turkeys (Topmax™) as a growth promoter to improve muscle yields. What about the domestic U.S. meat supply? Last year’s report from the USDA National Residue program claimed 310 pigs were tested (out of about 10 million slaughtered). The 2012 report listed the number of tested pigs at zero. That’s why it’s so important to have public interest organizations such as Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, to fill the gaps. This week Consumers Union released a report in which they analyzed 240 U.S. pork products and found trace levels of ractopamine in about 20% of retail pork sampled. In response, the National Pork Producers Council tried to allay concerns by noting that the levels found in U.S. pork chops were below the ractopamine residue limit set by the UN Codex Commission this summer. What they didn’t mention was that out of 143 ballots cast, the Commission came within a single vote of setting any safe levels in pork given “outstanding safety concerns” raised by Europe. The National Pork Producers Council also failed to mention the residue limit was based on a single human study that only had six people in it. That six person study was exhibit #1 in the European Food Safety Authority’s analysis of the questionable safety of the drug. EFSA is Europe’s equivalent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The experiment in question was a preliminary study designed not to establish a safety level, but to find a suitable test dose for a larger study that never happened. (Ractopamine was originally developed as an asthma medication but it didn’t appear to work). The study involved giving these six men between 5 to 40mg of ractopamine. At the higher levels, the subjects reported their hearts racing and pounding—in fact one of the six subjects was withdrawn from the study because he apparently couldn’t take it. At 5mg, though, no cardiac changes were noted. So that’s the dose the UN Codex Commission used to calculate the maximum allowable meat residue and acceptable human daily intake levels. Just because that dose didn’t cause a problem in six people, though, doesn’t necessarily mean that level is safe. The EFSA panel calculated that a study of 6 people wouldn’t even have the statistical power to pick up a 40% change in cardiac output, a key measured endpoint. To detect as statistically significant a 10% change in blood pumping the study would have required at least about 60 people. In addition, the study only looked at the cardiovascular effects of ractopamine. Given the adrenaline-like effects could expect metabolic effects such as an increase in blood sugar levels, muscle tremors, or behavioral effects such as restlessness, apprehension, or anxiety. Also, all six study subjects were healthy young men. What about particularly vulnerable populations such as children, those with heart disease, or those on certain medications? The panel concluded that the UN limits did not sufficiently take these higher risk populations into account. The European Food Safety Authority concluded that the single small human study “can not be taken as a basis to derive an acceptable daily intake…and consequently no proposal for maximum [meat] residue levels could be made.” In other words, we simply don’t have enough human data to determine what the safe level in meat may be. Last month the Council of the European Union joined China in reaffirming the ban on ractopamine, “[s]tressing that the policy…is based on persisting scientific uncertainty about the safety of products derived from animals treated with this substance…and also takes into account concerns on animal health and animal welfare….” Studies over the last decade have shown that pigs on ractopamine may have chronically elevated heart rates, increased stress reactions, and difficulty walking. In fact the warning label reads: ‘‘Caution: Pigs fed PAYLEAN are at an increased risk for exhibiting the downer pig syndrome,” a condition in which pigs are too sick, injured, or exhausted to stand and may be dragged to slaughter in chains. It’s ironic that pork industry continues to defend the use of gestation crates for pregnant pigs on the pretext of preventing aggression between the sows. Mother pigs are confined for nearly their entire lives in crates so restrictive they can’t even turn around. The industry claims this is to keep them from fighting while at the same time feeding millions of growing pigs a drug shown to increases aggressiveness and attacks. Given the human and animal welfare concerns, why does the U.S. pork industry continue to feed this drug to millions of pigs every year? This month a meta-analysis was published in the Journal of Animal Science. Based on all the studies done to date, pigs fed ractopamine “had an overall carcass cutability advantage of 1.01 percentage units when compared to control pigs” (74.70% vs. 73.69%). All this for a 1% greater yield. Watch my video Ractopamine in Pork for more. Another public health breach filled this week by Consumers Union was testing for Yersinia enterocolitica in pork. Every year the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tests thousands of retail meat samples for the presence of a few types of antibiotic resistant bacteria, but Yersinia is not among them despite the fact that nearly 100,000 Americans are sickened by foodborne Yersinia every year. Pigs are considered to be the main reservoir for Yersinia enterocolitica and pork products the main source of human infection. While most foodborne pathogens tend to come from a variety of sources, 100% of the attributable Yersinia outbreaks reported in the United States from 1999 through 2008 were caused by pork. How contaminated is the U.S. pork supply? Consumers Union tested nearly 200 pork samples from cities across the country and found more than two thirds contaminated with Yersinia, 90% of which were resistant to one or more antibiotics. In most cases Yersinia food poisoning just causes acute gastroenteritis characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and often bloody diarrhea. Severe cases are frequently confused with appendicitis, leading to unnecessary emergency surgery. Long-term sequelae of infection include chronic inflammation of the eyes, kidneys, heart, and joints. Within a year of a bout of Yersinia food poisoning, victims may be at 47 times the risk of coming down with autoimmune arthritis. The bacteria may also play a role in triggering an autoimmune thyroid condition known as Graves’ disease. Yersinia enterocolitica is widespread in U.S. pigs. A national USDA survey of fecal samples found about half of American herds are now infected with strains pathogenic to humans. The increasing emergence of human infection over last century has been blamed on the industrialization of the pork industry. Higher stocking densities of pigs on factory farms is one of the factors that has been specifically associated with increased Yersinia enterocolitica prevalence in herds. Inside some swine confinement buildings researchers have been able to culture the bacteria straight out of the air, as well as from inside the nostrils of CAFO workers. The pork industry acknowledges overcrowding pigs is associated with increased health risks, but the trade journal National Hog Farmer reports research showing that when “space was dropped to 6 sq. ft./pig, the building produced 26% more pounds of pork at the same fixed cost.” That’s cramming a 200 pound pig into the equivalent of about a 2 by 3 foot space. Sometimes, the article concludes, “crowding grow-finish pigs a little tighter will make you more money.” The equation for industrial pork producers is even simpler when it comes to Yersinia enterocolitica since the bacteria doesn’t cause clinical disease in pigs. The fact that the industry bottomline isn’t directly affected no matter how high infection rates climb may explain why there are no industry-wide Yersinia monitoring and control programs in place in the United States. Such costs can be passed on to the tens of thousands of Americans who continue to be sickened every year at an annual estimated cost of a quarter billion dollars. Research from Europe suggests pigs raised using organic methods may 50 times lower odds of harboring Yersinia enterocolitica infection compared to pigs raised conventionally. It is unlikely these results can be extrapolated to the United States, though, since organic production in the U.S. focuses more on what animals are fed rather than how they are treated. For example in Europe, organic pigs are allowed outside. After studying a variety of factors, the researchers ended up attributing the low rates of Yersinia infection on organic farms to lower levels of stress among the animals. If stress is indeed a contributing factor, things may be looking up in Europe. On January 1st, 2013, gestation crates for pregnant pigs are going to be banned across all 27 nations of the European Union. In the U.S. where crating continues to be a predominant practice, pregnant sows have been shown to have among the highest prevalence of Yersinia enterocolitica. Though consumers don’t directly eat as many of the moms, the sows can be a source of infection for piglets who can carry the infection through slaughter. Crated sows have been shown to have impaired immunity, thought to be a result of elevated stress hormone levels related to the frustration of normal maternal behaviors like nest building. Yersinia enterocolitica is one of the reasons why the disease resistance of mother pigs matters when it comes to public health. Thankfully, major retailers, restaurant chains, and leaders in the pork industry have started phasing out gestation crates, which may end up improving the welfare of both animals and humans. Another proposal to help break the Yersinia cycle from farm to fork is to pay producers a premium for animals maintained in Yersinia-free herds. Since 1996 some in the agriculture policy arena have even proposed that fresh meat should only be allowed from infection-free herds, diverting pork from infected herds to just making pre-cooked products. “Although such a two-way splitting of pig-meat production would pose a logistical problem,” researchers acknowledge, “it should actually be possible…[if] enough emphasis were to be placed on cost/benefit for public health.” There are also measures effective at reducing Yersinia contamination of the meat in the slaughterplant. Studies from Europe have shown that “bagging the rectum” by sealing off the excised rectum with a plastic bag during evisceration may result in a 10-fold drop in carcass contamination. According to data from the Norwegian National Institute of Public Health, human Yersinia infection rates dropped about 25% after the introduction of the plastic bag technique across about 90% of the pig slaughterhouses in Norway. Earlier this year, the National Pork Board officially changed their quarter-century old slogan from Pork: The Other White Meat,” to “Pork: Be Inspired.” Given the new Consumer Reports findings, maybe it should it be changed to “Pork: Be Expired.” To put the new data in perspective, though, Yersinia in pork ranks 16th in terms of greatest foodborne disease burden in the United States. The worst in terms of societal cost and quality-adjusted years of life lost is poultry-borne Campylobacter bacteria, found contaminating 38% of chicken breasts in the latest CDC retail meat survey released this year. Then comes the Toxoplasma brain parasite in pork, Listeria in deli meats, and Salmonella in, again, poultry. So as concerning as this new report may be, we are probably still more likely to get sick eating the original white meat. 	-	food poisoning,pigs,pork,ractopamine,yersinia	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/yersinia-in-pork/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/ractopamine-in-pork/	http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/1041.pdf,http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/pork0113.htm

A-425	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/11/15/boost-serotonin-naturally/	How To Boost Serotonin Naturally	A strange letter was recently published in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience suggesting fruit as a treatment for depression. It starts out detailing how bad the disease can be; how abnormally low levels of neurotransmitters like the “happiness hormone” serotonin in the brain may be responsible; and that we now have SSRI drugs like Prozac that appear to work by boosting serotonin levels. However, these medications can carry significant side effects, so the researchers suggested a novel strategy: How about using “high-content sources of serotonin to provide our body with these substances,” such as “plantains, pineapples, bananas, kiwis, plums, and tomatoes.” Since when do plants have animal neurotransmitters? Since forever, I was surprised to learn. In my 2-min NutritionFacts.org video Human Neurotransmitters in Plants I show how plants may contain levels of dopamine, serotonin, and melatonin at concentrations high enough to actually alter levels in our bloodstream. We don’t need serotonin in our blood, though; we need it in our brain. Serotonin can’t cross the blood-brain barrier, but the precursor to serotonin can. This precursor is an amino acid called tryptophan that we get from our diet. Back in the 70’s experiments showed that when people were given specially concocted tryptophan deficient diets, their mood suffered. They became irritable, annoyed, angry, and depressed. Likewise, you can give people tryptophan pills to improve their mood, and, not surprisingly, it became a popular dietary supplement… until people started dying from something called eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome (EMS). As I note in my 2-min video The Wrong Way to Boost Serotonin, EMS is an incurable, debilitating, and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition that can be caused by the ingestion of tryptophan supplements. It may have been due to some unknown impurity, but better safe than sorry. Instead of supplements, there are dietary strategies one can use to improve mood. When people think tryptophan, they think Thanksgiving turkey, but researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier into the brain. Since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities it gets muscled out of the way. When we eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates trigger a release of insulin that causes our muscles to take up many of the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel, potentially leaving our tryptophan first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse. In the experiment I describe in my 2-min video A Better Way to Boost Serotonin, those given a turkey/egg/cheese breakfast experienced a drop in tryptophan levels, whereas those given a waffle/orange juice breakfast saw their levels rise. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS—your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. One study I cite concluded “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs. Since the main determinant of brain tryptophan and serotonin concentrations appears to be the ratio of this amino acid with others that compete with it for uptake into the brain, to maximize the mood elevating benefits of diet, one would ideally choose a snack with a high tryptophan to total protein ratio, which would mean primarily seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin. Check out the final video The Best Way to Boost Serotonin in this four-part series for more detail. 	-	depression,dopamine,prozac,serotonin,tryptophan	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-boost-serotonin//,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-way-to-boost-serotonin/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-boost-serotonin//,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-way-to-boost-serotonin/	
A-426	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/11/08/magnesium-to-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death/	Magnesium-Rich Foods to Prevent Sudden Death	Most men and women who succumb to heart disease die suddenly without any known history of heart problems. As I note in my 3-min. NutritionFacts.org video How Do Nuts Prevent Sudden Cardiac Death?, up to 55% of men and 68% of women have no clinically recognized heart disease before sudden death. They obviously had rampant heart disease, it just wasn’t recognized until they were lying in the morgue. So if there was ever a case to be made for primary prevention—starting to eat healthier right now, tonight—before symptoms arise, sudden cardiac death is it. Especially since our first symptom is often our last. OK, so how do we do it? Our story begins 43 years ago with a fascinating paper in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled “Sudden Death and Ischemic Heart Disease: Correlation With Hardness of the Local Water Supply.” There appeared to be “an increased susceptibility to lethal arrhythmias [fatal heart rhythms] among residents of soft-water areas.” So maybe one of the minerals found in hard water is protective, but which one? Well, researchers decided to cut some hearts open and find out. On autopsy the hearts of sudden cardiac death victims had significantly lower magnesium concentrations compared to people that just got hit by a bus or something. They thought there might be a connection, but it wasn’t put to the test until recently. Why the decades-long delay in testing a potentially cheap simple way to help prevent our number one killer? That’s exactly the problem: cheap. Where’s magnesium found? Whole grains, greens, beans, nuts, and seeds. Who’s going to fund the study? The pumpkin seed lobby? Big spinach? If magnesium was found to be protective, who’s going to profit? Who’s going to benefit? Other than, of course, the hundreds of thousands of Americans that keel over dead every year without even being able to say goodbye to their families. Watch my video Mineral of the Year–Magnesium to see what the new studies discovered. 	-	arrhythmias,cardiac death,heart disease,magnesium,nuts	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-nuts-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-nuts-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mineral-of-the-year-magnesium/,http://www.flickr.com/photos/debaird/	
A-427	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/11/01/how-to-enhance-mineral-absorption/	How to Enhance Mineral Absorption	Iron is a double-edged sword. If we don’t absorb enough we risk anemia, but if we absorb too much we may be increasing our risk of colorectal cancer, heart disease, infection, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions. See my 3-min. NutritionFacts.org video Risk Associated With Iron Supplements. Other conditions that have been associated with high iron intake include Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, arthritis, and diabetes. Because the human body has no mechanism to rid itself of excess iron, we evolved to tightly regulate the absorption of it. If our iron stores are low our intestines boost the absorption of iron, and if our iron stores are topped off our intestines block the absorption of iron to maintain us at the sweet spot. However, this only works with the primary source of iron in the human diet, the iron found in plant foods. Our digestive system can’t regulate the iron in ingested blood (“heme” iron) as effectively. The iron in animal foods can just zip right through our intestinal barrier, even if we already have too much. We just don’t have as much control. For more on iron, see my videos Iron During Pregnancy and Are Iron Pills Good For You? Iron overload may be one of the reasons meat consumption has been tied to breast cancer risk. Iron is a pro-oxidant and can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage. Quoting from one of the studies I feature in the video, “A high intake of iron in developed societies may, over time, lead to a physiologic state of iron overload in postmenopausal women, who are no longer losing blood every month. Iron overload favors the production of free radicals, fat oxidation, DNA damage, and may contribute to breast carcinogenesis independently or by potentiating the effects of other carcinogens.” For more on breast cancer, some good videos to start with include Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen, Flax and Fecal Flora, and Broccoli Versus Breast Cancer Stem Cells. Only people with a confirmed diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia should consider supplementing their iron intake, and even then it can be risky.  Another recent study I explore found a significant increase in oxidative stress within the bodies of women on iron supplements. Therefore, before going on iron supplements I would suggest talking to your physician about first trying to treat it through diet alone. This means eating lots of healthy iron-rich foods like chickpeas and pumpkin seeds while consuming vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus, tropical fruits, broccoli, and bell peppers. The vitamin C-rich foods improve plant iron absorption, which is why they should be consumed at the same meal. Tea and coffee drinking, on the other hand, should be avoided with your meals since that can impair iron absorption. For more on nutrient bioavailability, see my videos Take Vitamin D Supplements With Meals, Calcium Absorption: Soy Milk Versus Cow Milk, Raw Food Nutrient Absorption, and Forgo Fat-Free Dressings? The whole grain phytonutrient, phytic acid (phytate), partially inhibits mineral absorption, but has a wide range of health-promoting properties such as anti-cancer activity. By concurrently eating mineral absorption enhancers, such as garlic and onions, one can get the best of both worlds by improving the bioavailability of iron and zinc in plant foods. Watch New Mineral Absorption Enhancers Found. Another example of nutrient synergy is the reaction between black pepper and the spice turmeric as described in Garden Variety Anti-Inflammation. 	-	Alzheimer's,anemia,arthritis,breast cancer,colorectal cancer,heart disease,infection,inflammation,iron,iron supplements	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iron-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-vs-cow-calcium-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-iron-pills-good-for-you/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iron-during-pregnancy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calcium-absorption-soy-milk-versus-cow-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/take-vitamin-d-supplements-with-meals/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/risk-associated-with-iron-supplements/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-iron-pills-good-for-you/	
A-428	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/10/25/what-should-women-eat-to-live-longest/	Eating To Extend Our Lifespan	Why can’t we live forever? Some animals do, and I don’t mean some 200 year old whale–I’m talking immortal. There are actually species of animals that don’t age and could technically go on living forever–and why not? In a sense, humans are immortal in that a few of our cells live on as sperm or egg cells lucky enough to find each other. Each of our kids grow out of one of our cells, and that alone (the fact that a single cell can grow into an entire person!) should make, in comparison, the notion of keeping our bodies going indefinitely seem trivial. Human longevity is certainly a hot research topic. Much of the research has focused on the role of DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), the most abundant steroid hormone in the human body. DHEA may help counteract the effects of stress, preserve female fertility, and it appears to be a strong predictor of longevity. Caloric restriction is thought to extend the lifespan of many animals by upregulating DHEA, which normally declines as we age. DHEA is sold as a “fountain of youth” over-the-counter dietary supplement, but concerns have been raised about safety, side effects, and quality control. There is, however, a natural way to boost DHEA levels. As I note in my 3-min. video The Benefits of Caloric Restriction Without The Actual Restricting, after just 5 days on an egg-free vegetarian diet blood levels of DHEA rise about 20%. Upon further testing, it seems that the bodies of those eating vegetarian weren’t necessarily producing more of it, but just losing less, something one normally only sees in fasting. Thus, by eating vegetarian one may be able to mimic the effects of caloric restriction, but without walking around starving all the time. For more on diet and life expectancy see Research Into Reversing Aging and Harvard’s Meat and Mortality Studies plus my 30 other videos on lifespan. If you haven’t yet, you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here. Recently, the risk factors for mortality were published for the Harvard Nurse’s Health Study, which is currently the most definitive long-term study ever on older women’s health. It is the subject of my 2-min. video What Women Should Eat to Live Longer. Since the leading cause of death was heart disease, it is no surprise that dietary cholesterol consumption was significant risk factor for death. The second leading cause was smoking-related cancer deaths. Comparing the two, consuming the amount of cholesterol found in just a single egg a day appears to cut a woman’s life short as much as smoking 5 cigarettes a day for 15 years. The most protective behavior they found was fiber consumption. Eating just a cup of oatmeal’s worth of fiber a day appears to extend a woman’s life as much as 4 hours of jogging a week–though there’s no reason we can’t do both! The one specific food most tied to longevity was nuts. Women appear to get 4 hours of weekly jogging benefit eating just two handfuls of nuts a week as well. Taking a step back, though, it’s worth noting that the intake of cholesterol, only found in animal foods, was associated with living a shorter life and the intake of fiber, only found in plant foods, was associated with living a longer life. 	-	caloric restriction,dehydroepiandrosterone,DHEA,egg-free,fertility,human longevity,processed meat,smoking,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifespan/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-benefits-of-caloric-restriction-without-the-actual-restricting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/smoking-versus-kale-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-benefits-of-caloric-restriction-without-the-actual-restricting/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lifespan/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/smoking-versus-kale-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-women-should-eat-to-live-longer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://bit.ly/nutritionfactsupdates,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/	
A-429	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/10/18/kiwi-fruit-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/	Kiwifruit for Irritable Bowel Syndrome	An estimated 10-20% of the general population suffers from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which accounts for about 4 million doctors’ visits a year. What can we do for these tens of millions of sufferers? In my video Kiwifruit for Irritable Bowel Syndrome I profile a “kiwifruit intervention.” Researchers found that eating 2 kiwifruit a day for a month significantly “shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves bowel function” in those with constipation-type IBS. Furthermore, “No deleterious effects of kiwifruit consumption on psychological functioning or adverse events were found in these studies.” I would hope not! The reason the researchers put that in there, though, is to contrast kiwi fruit to tegaserod, the most frequently prescribed drug for IBS. Well, at least it was before it was pulled from the market out of concern that it was killing people by increasing their risk of heart attack and stroke. Thus, I’d suggest trying the kiwis first. The role of fruit, fiber, and antioxidants may help explain why people eating plant-based diets have improved bowel function in general. See my videos Bristol Stool Scale, Bulking Up on Antioxidants, Bowels of the Earth, Food Mass Transit, and Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants. What else can kiwis do? We’ve known that fruits, vegetables, and other whole plant foods rich in antioxidants can decrease oxidative damage to our DNA, but only recently has there been work done on dietary interventions to boost DNA repair, our second line of defense against cancer. We’re going to get some DNA damage in this polluted world no matter how healthy our diets and lifestyles are, so its critical to find ways to upregulate our DNA repair enzymes to better assist with stitching our DNA back together. What would happen if people were given some kiwifruits on and off for a few weeks? Find out in my video Kiwifruit and DNA Repair. The video ends with a question about trying to break through the kiwi plateau effect with other fruits and vegetables. Find out whether this was possible in the follow-up 3-min. video Plant-Based Diets and Cellular Stress Defenses. The results support the previous work on the importance of dietary diversity that I profiled in Apples and Oranges and Garden Variety Anti-Inflammation. The study of thousands of foods I mention is referring to Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods and Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. Note the study was measuring so-called “epigenetic” changes, meaning differential gene expression. Just because we have a certain set of genes doesn’t mean we can’t turn them on and off with changes in our diet (see Mitochondrial Theory of Aging and Convergence of Evidence). 	-	antioxidants,cancer,DNA,fiber,fruit,heart attack,IBS,irritable bowel syndrome,kiwifruit,stroke,tegaserod	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/repairing-dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-and-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bristol-stool-scale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/kiwifruit-and-dna-repair/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-and-cellular-stress-defenses,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/convergence-of-evidence/	
A-430	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/10/04/preventing-kidney-failure-with-diet/	Preventing and Treating Kidney Failure With Diet	Our kidneys are highly vascular organs. That’s why when you see kidneys in the meat case they look so red. After all, our two little kidneys have to filter through our entire blood supply and as such receive about 20% of our cardiac output every time our heart beats. So if the standard American diet can be so toxic to the blood vessels in our heart, back, abdomen, and pelvis, contributing to heart attacks (Heart Attacks and Cholesterol: Purely a Question of Diet), spinal disc degeneration (Cholesterol and Lower Back Pain), aneurisms (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: Ticking Time Balloons), and sexual dysfunction (Cholesterol and Female Sexual Dysfunction), what might it be doing to our kidneys? In my 2-min. video, Preventing Kidney Failure Through Diet, I profile a recent Harvard study putting that question to the test. Thousands of women, their diets, and their kidney function were followed for a decade. The researchers found three significant risk factors for declining kidney function in these women; none of which come as a surprise given that we’re talking about clogged and inflamed blood vessels: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. All three of these risk factors are only found in animal-based foods. No such association was found for plant protein or plant fat. Failing kidneys can be a canary in a coal mine, informing us about the health of our blood vessels. Quoting from the Harvard study, “modest decrements in kidney function are powerfully associated with subsequent overt kidney disease, cardiovascular risk, and all-cause mortality,” meaning a shortened lifespan. “In summary, diets lower in animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol may be protective” against this kind of kidney damage. What if the damage has already been done, and you’re already suffering from chronic renal failure? That’s the subject of my video Treating Kidney Failure Through Diet. One of the important functions of our kidneys is to filter out excess phosphorus from our bloodstream, and so when our kidney function declines, phosphorus can build up in our bodies and cause something called metastatic calcification, where your heart valves and muscles and other parts of your body can buildup calcium deposits and eventually result in skin necrosis, gangrene, and amputations. So, if a person has diminished kidney function their doctor will likely put them on a low phosphate diet, which is tough, because basically everything with protein has phosphorus. So both plant foods and animal foods have phosphorus. But vegans have been shown to have significantly better kidney function, on average, compared to omnivores. So while researchers concluded that “These results can confirm the usefulness of vegetarianism here and support the use of a vegan diet for the patients with kidney failure,” maybe it was just because the omnivores were getting a higher protein load. We know that lower protein diets appear to delay the progression of kidney failure, so did the plant based diet help because they were eating less protein or because the body somehow is able to handle plant protein better than animal protein? To do that you’d have to split people into two groups, half on a vegetarian diet, half not, with the critical caveat to make sure both groups eat the exact same amount of protein and the exact same amount of phosphorus. And that’s exactly what researchers did. Published recently in the journal of the American Society of Nephrology, they took vegetarians and put them on a meat diet, and then took meat-eaters and put them on a vegetarian diet. Even though  phosphorus and protein intake were kept the same in both diet groups, in the video you can see an illustration of the level of phosphorus stuck in the bloodstream of those on the meat diet, compared to those on the veg diet. Something about plant foods appears to enable our bodies to better handle their phosphorus content. Plant phosphorus appears easier to cleanse away. Positive results have been seen with even semi-vegetarian diets, but the reason the new study  “observed more dramatic differences after only 1 week, was perhaps because of the pure vegetarian diets used in our study. Taken together, vegetarian-based diets may be beneficial for the control of phosphorus balance in patients with chronic kidney disease.” 	-	animal fat,animal protein,cholesterol,Harvard study,heart attacks,kidney,meat,plant fat,plant protein,Standard American Diet	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-kidney-failure-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/abdominal-aortic-aneurysms-ticking-time-balloons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-lower-back-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruits-for-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-purely-a-question-of-diet/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-kidney-failure-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/safest-source-of-b12/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/abdominal-aortic-aneurysms-ticking-time-balloons/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-lower-back-pain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-arthritis-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-and-female-sexual-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-fruits-for-cancer-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2011/10/14/heart-disease-there-is-a-cure/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-purely-a-question-of-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-kidney-failure-through-diet	
A-431	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/27/is-caffeinated-tea-really-dehydrating/	Is Caffeinated Tea Really Dehydrating?	Phytonutrients exclusive to the tea plant appear so powerful that they can reverse disease even when just applied to the skin. Now officially incorporated into the Centers for Disease Control STD Treatment Guidelines, the topical application of green tea extracts on external genital warts results in an astounding 100% clearance in more than half the patients tested (see my 2-min. video Treating Genital Warts With Green Tea). Green tea may even stop skin cancer. In Treating Gorlin Syndrome With Green Tea, I describe a remarkable case report of a woman with basal cell nevus syndrome, a rare genetic condition in which one’s body becomes covered in skin cancers. Her cancer was apparently reversed with topical green tea body wraps. This builds on research into the dietary reversal of other cancers (see Cancer Reversal Through Diet?). These examples are a testament to the Power of Plants. It’s in line with research on cinnamon (The Safer Cinnamon), saffron (Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s), watermelon (Watermelon as Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction), flaxseeds (Just the Flax, Ma’am), and Indian gooseberries (Amla Versus Diabetes). Since there are few or no downsides to plant food remedies–if anything, lots of positive side effects!–I have rarely hesitated to prescribe such natural products in my own medical practice. Which type of tea is best to consume internally? The same leaves of the same plant are used to make white, green, oolong, and black tea. The primary difference is how they are processed; white being the least processed and black being the most. In Green Tea vs. White, I showed that green tea has the most antioxidant power–unless you added lemon, in which case white tea pulls ahead. New research has taken this a step further and tested their respective abilities to prevent DNA damage. In my 2-min. video Antimutagenic Activity of Green vs. White Tea, green is pitted against white in a head-to-head test against a potent carcinogen found in grilled chicken. White won, and the longer it was brewed, the more protective it became. The longer-the-better brewing time didn’t surprise me, but this did: Cold Steeping Green Tea. Another way to maximize the phytonutrient absorption from tea is to eat it; see Is Matcha Good for You? and A Better Breakfast. One can overdo it though (see Overdosing on Tea). Other ways to protect one’s DNA include eating broccoli, avoiding bacon, not overdoing stevia, as well as eating a plant-based diet in general (see Repairing DNA Damage and Research Into Reversing Aging). Isn’t caffeinated tea dehydrating though? Comparing up to 6 cups of caffeinated black tea a day to water, researchers studied the common assertion that tea acts as a diuretic and is not as hydrating as plain water. Find out the results in my short video Is Caffeinated Tea Dehydrating? The nutrition without calories concept in the video refers, not surprisingly, to my video Nutrition Without Calories. 	-	amla,antioxidants,bacon,broccoli,cancer,cinnamon,flaxseeds,genital warts,gorlin syndrome,Green tea,phytonutrients,saffron,skin cancer,stevia,tea,watermelon	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soda/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/repairing-dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gorlin-syndrome-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-tea-vs-white/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-matcha-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-hyperactivity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-sodium-benzoate-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-without-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funding-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-tea/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antimutagenic-activity-of-green-versus-white-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/repairing-dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-gorlin-syndrome-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/research-into-reversing-aging/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mercury-in-corn-syrup/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-breakfast/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-caffeinated-tea-dehydrating/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-stevia-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-safer-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/green-tea-vs-white/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-the-caffeine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-matcha-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/watermelon-as-treatment-for-erectile-dysfunction/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-the-smell-of-frying-bacon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-genital-warts-with-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-without-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/power-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-industry-funding-effect/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-tea/	
A-432	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/how-much-arsenic-in-rice-came-from-chickens/	How Much Arsenic In Rice Came From Chickens?	It may be no coincidence that the rice found most contaminated with arsenic originated from some of the top poultry producing states such as Arkansas, Texas, and Missouri. Earlier this year, researchers at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found levels of arsenic in chicken feather meal up to 100 times that found in apple juice by Dr. Oz last year and 10 times that just found in rice. Feather meal is made from the billion pounds of feathers plucked from chicken carcasses annually (sometimes with heads, guts, manure, and feet thrown in to increase protein and mineral content) and is fed to farmed fish, pigs, poultry, and cattle as well as used to fertilize both conventional and organic crops. Chicken manure is also used directly as feed and fertilizer and has been found to significantly increase arsenic levels in the soil. Some of the arsenic in apple juice and rice may from the use of arsenic-containing pesticides, but how did arsenic get into the chickens? The poultry industry fed it to them. Two million pounds of arsenic-containing chemicals have been fed to chickens annually in the United States. Why would the industry do such a thing? When tens of thousands of birds are crammed into filthy football field-sized sheds to lie beak-to-beak in their own waste they can become so heavily infested with internal parasites that adding arsenic to the feed to poison the bugs can result in a dramatic increase in growth rates. Arsenic can also give the carcass a pinkish tinge, which consumers prefer. Though arsenic-based feed additives have been banned in Europe for over a decade, they continue to be legal in the United States. One drug company did announce last summer, that it has suspended sales to domestic poultry companies after the FDA found concerning levels of a particularly toxic form of arsenic in edible tissues of chickens eating feed laced with their arsenic-containing drug. Unfortunately, the drug company continues to manufacture and export the feed additive and another arsenic-containing poultry drug remains on the U.S. market. 	-	apple juice,arsenic,chicken,Dr. Oz,FDA,poultry,rice	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-rice/	http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm258313.htm,http://render-site.s3.amazonaws.com/issues/Apr09Render.pdf,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/026974839090071Y,http://www.iatp.org/files/421_2_80529.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/19/dr-oz-apple-juice-and-arsenic-chicken-may-have-10-times-more/,http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/business/09arsenic.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21916049,http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108125/pdf/ijerph-08-01534.pdf,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44799087,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22244353,http://pubs.acs.org/cen/government/85/8515gov2.html	
A-433	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/why-meat-causes-inflammation/	How Does Meat Cause Inflammation?	The anti-inflammatory effect of plant-based diets is about more than just the power of plants. It’s also the avoidance of animal foods. In my blog last week, Treating Crohn’s Disease With Diet, I profiled the extraordinary power of even a semi-vegetarian diet to calm inflammatory bowel disease. We’ve known for 14 years that a single meal of meat, dairy, and eggs triggers an inflammatory reaction inside the body within hours of consumption. This results in a stiffening of our arteries (you can see the arterial response curve in my 4-min. video The Leaky Gut Theory of Why Animal Products Cause Inflammation). Within 5 or 6 hours, the inflammation starts to cool down, but then what happens? Lunchtime! At that point we can whack our arteries with another load of animal products for lunch. In this routine, we may be stuck in a chronic low-grade inflammation danger zone for most of our lives. This can set us up for inflammatory diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers one meal at a time. What exactly is causing the meat-induced inflammation? Inflammation is an immune response to a perceived threat, but what’s the body attacking? At first, scientists thought it might be the animal protein, which is thought to be the culprit in certain types of arthritis. However, similar inflammatory reactions were triggered by whipped cream, which is mostly just animal fat. After digging deeper, investigators discovered that after a meal of animal products one’s bloodstream becomes soiled with bacterial toxins known as endotoxins. No wonder there’s so much inflammation! But where are the endotoxins coming from? Endotoxins come from bacteria. Where are there lots of bacteria? In our gut. Thus, researchers figured that maybe the saturated animal fat was causing our gut lining to become leaky, allowing our own bacteria to slip into our blood stream. Experiments on mice showed that indeed saturated fat made their guts leaky, so for years this was the prevailing theory as to why animal products caused inflammation within hours of consumption. Only recently did researchers realize this didn’t make any sense. In my 2-min. video The Exogenous Endotoxin Theory, I illustrate the critical flaw to the leaky gut theory: the time scale. The rise in inflammation after a meal of meat, dairy, and eggs starts within just an hour of ingestion, but our gut flora aren’t in our small intestine–rather, twenty feet farther down in our large intestine. It can take food hours to get down there, so what was going on? If the bacterial endotoxins were not coming from our gut, maybe they were coming from the food. For the first time ever, 27 common foodstuffs were tested and they found endotoxin equivalents in foods such as pork, poultry, dairy, and egg products, as well as certain fermented foods. Can endotoxins be cooked out of the meat? Find out in the final wrap-up video in the series, Dead Meat Bacteria Endotoxemia. 	-	animal fat,animal protein,anti-inflammatory,arteries,bacteria,breast cancer,crohn's disease,dairy,diabetes,eggs,endotoxin,gut,heart disease,inflammation,meat,pork	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/13/dietary-treatment-for-crohns-disease/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/13/dietary-treatment-for-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-rheumatoid-arthritis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia/	
A-434	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/13/dietary-treatment-for-crohns-disease/	Treating Crohn’s Disease With Diet	Inflammation has recently emerged as an important player in the development of age-related disability and many of our major chronic diseases including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Now that laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein have been developed, we can measure the effects different foods and diets have on inflammatory markers. Most plant-based foods decrease inflammation. Processing destroys the anti-inflammatory effects of some (garlic decreases inflammation but garlic powder does not), but improves these effects in others (tomato juice decreases inflammation but whole tomatoes do not). For a review of which plants have been found to be most anti-inflammatory, check out my 3-min. video Anti-inflammatory Effects of Purple Potatoes. Do these anti-inflammatory plant foods actually have an impact on inflammatory disease mortality though? In my 2-min. video Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell I profile a new study out of Australia, which followed about 2,500 older adults and their diets for 15 years. In that time, about 200 participants died of inflammatory diseases, allowing the scientists to calculate the specific aspect of the survivors’ diets that seemed to help the most. It was nuts! The equivalent of half a walnut a day appeared to cut the risk of dying from inflammatory disease in nearly half. Fish consumption, to their surprise, didn’t seem to help, which may be due to pro-inflammatory industrial pollutants that build up the food chain. This may help explain why most studies done to date on those eating vegetarian or vegan have found lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers in their bodies. However, just because plant-based diets decrease markers of inflammation doesn’t necessarily mean that plant-based diets can successfully be used to fight inflammatory disease. To find that out, you’ve got to put it to the test. The gold standard for evidence in nutritional science is an interventional trial. You split people into two groups and ask half to go on one diet, half to go on another, and then stand back and see what happens. That’s just what researchers recently did for the  inflammatory bowel condition known as Crohn’s disease, profiled in my 4-min. video Dietary Treatment of Crohn’s Disease. Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune condition where your immune system attacks your own intestines. There is no cure; all you can do is try to keep it in remission as long as possible between attacks. Sufferers are often put in anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs and may find themselves in and out of the hospital getting segments of their intestines surgically removed. Since it’s the intestine itself that’s inflamed, it would seem a good condition to test out the anti-inflammatory power of plant-based diets. We’ve known that meat, cheese, fish, and animal protein in general has been found to increase risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease but what about plants to to not just prevent, but treat it? Japanese researchers took a group of Crohn’s patients in remission, either because they just came out of surgery or because they were able to beat it back with steroids. And for two years asked half of them to eat a semi-vegetarian diet, meaning in this case vegetarian except for half a serving of fish a week, and half a serving of other meat once every two weeks, so less than one serving of meat per week. Now this wasn’t a prison study or anything, these were free-living adults, so the results are not what necessarily happens when Crohn’s sufferers actually go on a plant-based diet, but what happens when people they are just told to eat a more plant based diet and how much they comply is up to them, which makes the results even more astounding. You can see the graph in the video, but basically 200 days into the study all of the patients told to eat more of a plant-based diet were still in remission, but about 20% of the group not told to eat anything different relapsed. After a year 100% of the semi-veg group still symptom free, but the disease re-emerged in half of the standard diet group. And at the end of two years, 92% of the patients told to eat a more plant-based diet remained without disease, whereas the majority of those not given that advise relapsed back in the cycles of drugs, hospitalizations and surgery. And that horrible relapse rate is typical on typical diets. Most Crohn’s sufferers relapse within a a year or two–unless, it seems, they start eating healthier. Remission rate, meaning disease-free status, with the semi-vegetarian diet was 100% at 1 year and 92% at 2 years. To the best of the researcher’s knowledge this is the best result in relapse prevention ever reported. 	-	Alzheimer’s disease,anti-inflammatory,cancer,crohn's disease,diabetes,garlic,heart disease,inflammation,tomato juice,walnut	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-macular-degeneration-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/achieving-remission-of-crohns-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-macular-degeneration-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/	
A-435	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/06/spices-antioxidants-in-a-pinch/	Antioxidants in a Pinch: Dried Herbs and Spices	In the Washington, DC area we are blessed with more than a dozen farmers’ markets. One local farm I frequent has a hydroponic greenhouse, so I can get fresh basil all year long. I’ve always been curious, though, how hydroponic basil—grown in water—compared nutritionally to basil grown in soil. Finally, a study was published comparing the two, which I feature in my 1-min. video Is Hydroponic Basil as Healthy? The hydroponic basil won hands down! It had more antioxidant power and more key vitamins and phytonutrients. Why? Because the basil doesn’t like being grown in water. It’s the same reason many organic greens are healthier. Organic plants get bitten by bugs and, in defense, cruciferous greens such as kale and collards manufacture more of those wonderful glucosinolate compounds I featured in my videos, Breast Cancer Stem Cells vs. Broccoli and The Best Detox. Likewise, under the environmental stress of drowning hydroponically, basil releases more phenolic antioxidant phytonutrients like rosmarinic acid to protect itself, and we can reap the benefits. For more on these compounds, see my 2-min. video Phytochemicals: The Nutrition Facts Missing From the Label. If you’re not lucky enough to live near a farm stand and too busy to grow your own, dried herbs and spices are surprisingly healthful. In fact, in a comparison of the Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods, ounce for ounce dried herbs and spices average the greatest antioxidant punch of all! Now even though herbs and spices may have 10 times the antioxidant power of nuts and seeds for example, it’s easy to eat a few ounces of nuts in one sitting, but not so easy to eat a few ounces of nutmeg. However, some herbs and spices are so off-the-charts amazing that just a small pinch can go a long way. Check out my video Antioxidants in a Pinch. It’s one of my all-time favorite NutritionFacts.org videos (I like the ones where I’m able to offer practical advice). 	-	antioxidant,basil,Care2,dried herbs,hydroponic basil,hydroponic greenhouse,minerals,nuts,organic,organic greens,organic plants,seeds,spices,vitamins	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/herbs/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-power-of-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-hydroponic-basil-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-hydroponic-basil-as-healthy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidants-in-a-pinch/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	
A-436	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/30/the-most-anti-inflammatory-mushroom/	The Most Anti-Inflammatory Mushroom	Atherosclerotic plaques may be more aptly described as pimples. These inflamed pockets of pus building up in the lining of our arteries can rupture, cut off our hearts’ blood supply, and kill us. In my 2-min. video Arterial Acne, I profile a New England Journal of Medicine review that describes the process. Death from heart disease starts with cholesterol infiltrating the lining of the coronary arteries crowning our heart. This triggers an inflammatory response. The inner lining of our artery produces adhesion molecules to snag white blood cells, called monocytes, that zoom past in the blood stream to try to repair some of the havoc cholesterol had wreaked inside the artery wall. Other inflammatory cells are called into action, more pus builds up, and it can end up like a big whitehead sticking out into the blood flow inside the artery. The blood pulsating past can rip off the cap and clot off the entire width of the artery, which can result in a fatal heart attack. The best way to stop this life-threatening cascade is to prevent it in the first place.  As I describe in my 2-min. video Blocking the First Step of Heart Disease, we can block the buildup of cholesterol by increasing our intake of fiber-containing plant foods and decreasing our intake of trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol found in junk food and animal products. Cholesterol-induced zits in the lining of our coronary arteries can also occur in other blood vessels. In our head they can cause a stroke (which I cover in my Uprooting video), in our back they can cause degenerative disk disease (Cholesterol and Lower Back Pain), in our abdomen they can cause an aneurysm (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: Ticking Time Balloons), and in our pelvis they can cause sexual dysfunction in both men (Atkins Diet: Trouble Keeping It Up) and women (Cholesterol and Female Sexual Dysfunction). Thankfully, Avoiding Cholesterol Is A No Brainer. It’s Purely a Question Of Diet. Trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol should be kept to a minimum. What about blocking the inflammation stage that follows the buildup of cholesterol? Researchers at Arizona State studied the ability of various mushrooms to do just that. They took the lining of a human artery, soaked it overnight with either nothing—the control group—or shitake mushrooms, crimini mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, maitake mushrooms, or plain white button mushrooms. Which mushroom worked best to decrease the expression of adhesion molecules? As I show in my 2-min. video Making Our Arteries Less Sticky the answer is that plain white mushrooms worked the best! The cheapest, most convenient to find mushroom appeared to suppress inflammation the best.

A-437	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/23/why-is-unsafe-meat-legal/	Why is it Legal to Sell Unsafe Meat?	Most of the U.S. population suffers an acute diarrheal illness every year. According to a recent survey, most people correctly identified food as the most common source of infection, but fewer than half (45%) believed it legal for grocery stores to sell meat with food-poisoning bacteria on it. You can’t sell unsafe cars; you can’t sell unsafe toys; how could they possibly sell unsafe meat? They do it by blaming the consumer. I quote one USDA poultry microbiologist in my 2-min. video Unsafe at Any Feed: “I think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it,” he said. “Raw meats are not idiot-proof. They can be mishandled and when they are, it’s like handling a hand grenade. If you pull the pin, somebody’s going to get hurt.” So it’s our fault if we get sick. That’s like a car company knowingly selling cars with faulty brakes and then blaming tragedies on parents for not putting their kids in rear-facing car seats. For more on the risks of handling fresh meat, see my 3-min. video Food Poisoning Bacteria Cross-Contamination. Patricia Griffin, director of Epidemiological Research at the Centers for Disease Control responded famously to this kind of blame-the-victim attitude. “Is it reasonable,” she asked, ‘“that if a consumer under cooks a hamburger…their three-year-old dies?” Some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in the supermarket in the first place. In Sweden, for example, it’s illegal to sell chicken contaminated with Salmonella, the leading cause of food poisoning deaths in the United States. It’s illegal to sell a product that could kill or cripple our children—what a concept! In my 4 min. video Fecal Bacteria Survey I feature an article in a meat industry trade publication that quotes an Alabama poultry science professor saying banning infected poultry is a “hard-handed” policy. He said: “The fact is that it’s too expensive not to sell salmonella-positive chicken….” Can you imagine a toy manufacturer saying, “Sorry, we’d love to pull unsafe toys off the market but such a large percentage of our toys are hazardous that it would cost us too much”? For other surveys on how much of the American meat supply is contaminated with fecal matter and foodborne pathogens see Fecal Contamination of Sushi, Fecal Residues on Chicken, Chicken Out of UTIs, U.S. Meat Supply Flying at Half Staph, and MRSA in U.S. Retail Meat. Salmonella-infected eggs also sicken more than 100,000 Americans every year (see Total Recall). 	-	CDC,chicken,fecal bacteria,fecal contamination,foodborne illness,hamburger,industry influence,meat,poultry,salmonella	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/u-s-meat-supply-flying-at-half-staph/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-out-of-utis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-residues-on-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-in-u-s-retail-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-contamination-of-sushi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/zero-tolerance-to-acceptable-risk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/u-s-meat-supply-flying-at-half-staph/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-out-of-utis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-bacteria-survey/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-residues-on-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/mrsa-in-u-s-retail-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fecal-contamination-of-sushi/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/unsafe-at-any-feed/	
A-438	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/09/health-food-store-advice-often-worthless-or-worst/	Health Food Store Advice: Often Worthless or Worst	How many times has this happened to you? You’re in a natural food store walking near the supplement section and an employee graciously asks if you need any help, and proceeds to offer advice on healing what ails you. You’ll notice it’s illegal for food and supplement companies to claim they can prevent or cure disease. That’s why you’ll just see so-called structure and function claims on labels like “supports immunity.” Federal law also basically prohibits people from diagnosing and prescribing without a medical license, yet you can probably walk into any health food store and get all the claims, diagnosing, and prescribing you could ever want. The question is: How good is that advice? I was delighted to learn that this very question was the subject of multiple studies spanning a decade. In my 2-min. Health Food Store Supplement Advice I profile a study in which a researcher posing as a daughter of a breast cancer patient went into 40 health food stores asking for their recommendations on cancer care. Ninety percent of the stores tried to sell her something—understandable, that’s their job. Ninety-five percent didn’t even ask a single question about her mom or the diagnosis, though, before recommending 38 different types of products at an annual cost of between $300 and $3000 ($18,000 in a similar study performed up in Canada). The most common recommendation was shark cartilage, a supplement studies have found effective only at causing side effects such as nausea, fever, dizziness, and even cases of life-threatening hypercalcemia and liver failure, but seemingly little else. (See my 2-min. video Dietary Supplement Snake Oil also). What should breast cancer patients do instead? See some of my videos on extending survival in survivors including Raw Broccoli and Bladder Cancer Survival; Breast Cancer Survival, Butterfat, and Chicken; Breast Cancer Survival and Trans Fat; Breast Cancer Survival and Lignan Intake; and Flax and Fecal Flora. Employees in natural food stores have been caught giving worse-than-useless advice that is not only scientifically baseless, but also risky and downright dangerous. In a study I cover in Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees, 26 stores recommended 36 different products to researchers claiming to have HIV/AIDS. They included some like garlic that can critically interfere with certain HIV medications. When the FDA and Health Canada issued advisory warnings to stop taking the herb kava kava due to one too many cases of fatal liver toxicity, this did not seem to affect health food store employee behavior. Would health food store employees recommend supplements contraindicated in pregnancy that could cause “significant harm to the mother and/or fetus”? You betcha. What kills me is that there are indeed pregnancy-safe, effective natural remedies for nausea like ginger, yet the women were instead advised to take herbs like feverfew and black cohosh, which can cause uterine contractions and possible miscarriage. What kind of training do health food store employees get? As I detail in my 2-min. video Bad Advice From Health Food Store Employees, most got absolutely none or in-store training only. It is no secret that I’ve been very critical of drug companies biasing medical training—that was much of what my first book on medical education was about, but what do we think stores are teaching their employees to say? Do pharmacists do any better? What is the accuracy of medical advice given by staff at natural food stores compared to that by staff at community pharmacies based on the balance of available scientific evidence? Find out in my 2-min. video Pharmacists Versus Health Food Store Employees: Who Gives Better Advice? 	-	breast cancer,disease,doctors,supplements	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-know-less-than-they-think-about-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/health-food-store-supplement-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pharmacists-versus-health-food-store-employees-who-gives-better-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-trans-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-broccoli-and-bladder-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-doctors-make-the-grade/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-supplement-snake-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-know-less-than-they-think-about-nutrition/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/health-food-store-supplement-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pharmacists-versus-health-food-store-employees-who-gives-better-advice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-trans-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bad-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/raw-broccoli-and-bladder-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-doctors-make-the-grade/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-supplement-snake-oil/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-and-fecal-flora/	
A-439	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/08/02/adding-fda-approved-viruses-to-meat/	Adding FDA-Approved Viruses to Meat	Bacteria-eating viruses (bacteriophages) have been approved as meat additives to reduce the food safety risks associated with processed meat and poultry products. There is a concern, however, that viruses fed to chickens could spread toxin genes between bacteria, the subject of my 3-min. video Viral Meat Spray (and noted in my full-length 2012 presentation Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death). In my book Bird Flu I have a chapter about more of these creative meat industry “technofixes.” Rectal poultry superglue anyone? In the video I talk about Listeria, the third leading cause of food poisoning related death. For more about leading causes #1 and #2 see my videos Total Recall and Brain Parasites in Meat, and for what Campylobacter can do, Poultry and Paralysis. For videos on other risks associated with processed meat consumption, see Preventing COPD with Diet, Prevention Is Better Than Cured Meat, and Hot Dogs & Leukemia. Additional feed additives of questionable safety in chicken are depicted in my videos Arsenic in Chicken and Drug Residues in Meat. The meat industry is concerned that consumers might be wary of the meat sprayed with bacteria-eating viruses: “[C]onsumer acceptance of bacteriophage usage may present something of a challenge to the food industry.” If they think they’re going to have consumer acceptance issues with spreading viruses on meat, that’s nothing compared to an even more novel technique to preserve meat I profile in my video Maggot Meat Spray. Think about it. Maggots thrive on rotting meat, yet there have been no reports that housefly larvae have any serious diseases, indicating that they may have a strong immune system. They must be packed with some sort of antibacterial properties—otherwise they’d presumably get infected and die themselves. So… researchers took 3-day-old maggots, blended them up, and voilà’—good grub! Or shall I say grubs? 	-	arsenic,bacteria,bacteria-eating virus,bacteriophage,bird flu,brain parasites,campylobacter,chickens,food industry,Listeria,maggots,meat,meat industry,poultry,processed meat,toxin genes,viruses	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/31/new-latest-nutrition-dvd-now-available-proceeds-to-charity/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheese-mites-and-maggots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nontoxic-head-lice-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bug-appetit-barriers-to-entomophagy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hot-dogs-leukemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/arsenic-in-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/maggot-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/good-grub-the-healthiest-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death,http://birdflubook.com/a.php?id=52,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cheese-mites-and-maggots/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/viral-meat-spray/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nontoxic-head-lice-treatment/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-artificial-colors-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brain-parasites-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/,http://birdflubook.com/g.php?id=5,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/drug-residues-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-paralysis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hot-dogs-leukemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/

A-441	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/27/mercury-testing-recommended-before-pregnancy/	Mercury Testing Recommended Before Pregnancy	Recent testing of mercury concentrations in three national brands of canned tuna found that “55% of all tuna examined was above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safety level for human consumption.” And the problem appears to be getting worse. Previous studies on canned tuna, in 1993 and 2004, showed concerning levels of mercury contamination, but not as bad as it is now. See my profile of the paper in my 2-min. video Which brand of tuna has the most mercury? Given the average level of mercury pollution found in canned tuna, researchers suggest that your average 9 year old would exceed the EPA limit even if they only ate a can of tuna every 6 weeks! They conclude: “These results indicate that stricter regulation of the canned tuna industry is necessary to ensure the safety of sensitive populations such as pregnant women, infants, and children.” Some question whether the federal safety limits are even sufficiently protective. A recent review from researchers at Harvard and elsewhere on the adverse effects of mercury in fish proposed that the exposure limits set in the United States should be cut in half. Already, current regulations in the United States allow up to 10 times as much mercury in fish as the EPA limit allows, and so our fish is allowed to have 20 times more mercury than may be considered safe. Because the EPA safety limit on mercury in fish may not sufficiently protect pregnant women in the United States, a recommendation has been put forth that fish-eating women may want to get tested for mercury before considering getting pregnant. It’s a simple test. Since mercury basically contaminates our whole body, all they need is a hair sample. See more details in my 2-min. video Hair Testing for Mercury Before Consider Pregnancy. Studies on children of the neurobehavioral toxicity of mercury suggest that no level of mercury exposure can truly be considered safe, but pressure from the fish industry may be preventing safety limits from dropping further. In my video Nerves of Mercury I profile a famous study published in the Journal of Pediatrics showing brain damage in adolescents at below the mercury limits placed on fish in this country. As one former EPA toxicologist told the Wall Street Journal, “They really consider the fish industry to be their clients, rather than the U.S. public.” Mercury is not just a problem for children. Mercury and other toxic pollutants in fish is thought to be why the consumption of dark fish (such as salmon, swordfish, bluefish, mackerel, and sardines) may increase one’s risk of atrial fibrillation, an irregularity of heart beat rhythm associated with stroke, dementia, heart failure, and a shortened lifespan. See my 2-min. video Red Fish, White Fish; Dark Fish, Atrial Fibrillation. Also check out Fish Fog, which discusses the link between fish consumption and neurobehavioral abnormalities in adults. For more information on industrial pollutants in fish, see Xenoestrogens & Sperm Counts and Fish Intake Biomarker. There are also natural toxins that can bioaccumulate up the aquatic food chain. See my 2-min. video Amnesic Seafood Poisoning about a rare toxin called domoic acid. It can turn up in tuna and other seafood and can cause anterograde amnesia, the loss of short-term memory popularized in the movie Memento. Even drugs can build up in fish. In my 1-min. video A Fine Kettle of Fluoxetine, I follow up on my earlier video Prozac Residues in Fish about the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in fish fillets.

A-442	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/19/preserving-vision-through-diet/	Preserving Vision Through Diet	More than a million Americans are blind. The good news is that all four of the most common causes of vision loss may be prevented with a healthy plant-based diet—age-related macular degeneration, diabetes, glaucoma, and cataracts. See my 2-min. video Preventing Macular Degeneration with Diet for a discussion of the relationship between vision loss and Harvard’s Alternative Healthy Eating Index (Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score offers an alternative to the alternative). Diabetes is not only a leading cause of blindness, but also of amputations and kidney failure. Thankfully diabetes can be prevented and even reversed. Glaucoma is a deterioration of our optic nerve, the nerve that connects our eyes to our brain, and is second only to cataracts as the world’s leading cause of blindness. Surprisingly, we still don’t know what causes it, so there’s been a desperate search for environmental and dietary influences. As I show in my 2-min. video Prevent Glaucoma and See 27 Miles Farther, the most protective dietary component—decreasing the odds of glaucoma by 69%!—was found to be the consumption of at least one serving of collard greens or kale per month. Just once a month or more. The silver and bronze medals for most protective food went to weekly carrot and peach consumption, respectively. We think it may be the lutein and zeaxanthin, two yellow plant pigments in greens that seem to know right where to go. When we eat them, they hone right into our retinas and appear to protect against degenerative eye disease. This is not a unique phenomenon. Lycopene is the red pigment in tomatoes found protective against prostate cancer.  Guess where it goes when a man eats a tomato? Straight to the prostate. Beta carotene in foods may prevent ovarian cancer and happens to build up in one’s ovaries. These phytonutrients not only protect, but also may improve our vision. Their peak light absorbance just so happens to be the wavelength of the color of our planet’s sky. According to a recent study, by filtering out that blue haze, “individuals with high macular pigment [lutein and zeaxanthin phytonutrients from greens]” standing atop a mountain on a clear day “may be able to distinguish distant mountain ridges up to 27 miles further than individuals with little or no pigment.” Don’t eggs also have significant amounts of these critical eyesight-saving nutrients? That’s the egg industry scrambling the truth—see my 2-min. video Egg Industry Blind Spot. I’d also encourage folks to stay away from lutein pills (and beta-carotene supplements). Finally, the leading cause of blindness and vision loss: cataracts. In my 2-min. video Preventing Cataracts with Diet I profile a study of 27,670 people with a wide range of diets. The study included so-called “high” meateaters, moderate meateaters, “low” meateaters, and fish-only eaters, versus those eating vegetarian and those eating vegan. The researchers went out of their way to choose health-conscious subjects to help factor out smoking, exercise, and other nondiet variables, and so the “high” meat consuming group? Only 100 grams a day–that’s just like 1 serving in one meal a day. In the U.S. we average more than 300 grams a day, so this is like reverse Starbucks labeling. You know how their “tall” is the small? Well here their “high” is really quite low by American standards.  Yet even compared to health-conscious light meat-eaters, those cutting back on meat even further could drop their associated cataract risk 15%. Those cutting all meat other than fish had 21% lower risk. Those cutting all meat—the vegetarians—appeared to drop their risk 30% and those going a step further and eliminating eggs and dairy had 40% less risk than the healthy one-serving-a-day meateaters. 	-	beta carotene,blind,carrots,cataracts,collard greens,diabetes,eggs,eye,glaucoma,Harvard's Alternative Healthy Eating Index,kale,kidneys,lutein,macular degeneration,peach,phytonutrients,plant-based diet,prostate,prostate cancer,tomatoes,vision,zeaxanthin	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-macular-degeneration-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/produce-not-pills-to-increase-physical-attractiveness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lutein-lycopene-and-selenium-pills/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-treat-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-macular-degeneration-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevent-glaucoma-and-see-27-miles-farther/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/produce-not-pills-to-increase-physical-attractiveness/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20492192,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lutein-lycopene-and-selenium-pills/	
A-443	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/12/skim-milk-and-acne/	Skim Milk and Acne	The National Dairy Council denies that milk intake causes acne, but a study they supported—the Harvard Nurse’s Health Study—found otherwise, as I show in my 3-min. video National Dairy Council on Acne and Milk. The conclusion reads: “We found a positive association with acne for intake of total milk and skim milk. We hypothesize that the association with milk may be because of the presence of hormones and bioactive molecules in milk.” Association does not necessarily mean causation, though. From the accompanying editorial in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology: “The papers…from the Harvard School of Public Health establish an association between milk consumption and acne. But how could milk cause acne? Because, drinking milk and consuming dairy products from pregnant cows exposes us to the hormones produced by the cows’ pregnancy, hormones that we were not designed to consume during our teenage and adult years. It is no secret that teenagers’ acne closely parallels hormonal activity…So what happens if exogenous hormones are added to the normal endogenous load? And what exactly is the source of these hormones? Consider that, in nature, milk is consumed from a mother, whether human or bovine, until weaning occurs. Normally, the mother then ceases lactation before the next pregnancy occurs—so that consuming milk from a mother pregnant with her next offspring is not a common occurrence. We’ve all seen nature films of animals chasing their offspring away to encourage weaning at the appropriate time. Further, in nature the offspring consumes only the milk of its own species—but both of these natural rules are broken by humans. Viewed objectively, human consumption of large volumes of another species’ milk, especially when that milk comes mainly from pregnant cows during the human’s normally post-weaned years, is essentially unnatural.” The Harvard Nurse’s Health Study found that the association between milk intake and severe physician-diagnosed teenage acne was even more marked for skim milk.  This may be because there is so much more estrogen in skim milk. Researchers found 15 steroid sex hormones in commercial milk right off the shelves, and the highest levels were found in skim milk, compared to 2% and whole (see my 4-min. video Hormones in Skim vs. Whole Milk). Milk—organic or conventional—is naturally a hormone cocktail. This is not a consequence of bovine growth hormone injections or added steroids. As a commentary in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology noted: “It should surprise no one that milk contains such a heavy complement of growth-enhancing hormones. Milk is, after all, specifically designed to make things grow.” As detailed in my 2-min. video Skim Milk and Acne, further studies of both adolescent girls and boys found a similar link between milk intake and acne, but pimples may be the least of our worries. The latest published update suggests that the restriction of cow’s milk consumption could have a beneficial effect on more serious epidemic diseases. Quoting from the review (in my 2-min. video Acne-Promoting Effects of Milk): “By million years of evolution the growth signaling system of mammalian milk is exclusively and physiologically provided to the newborn only during the nursing period. The chronic ‘abuse’ of this mammalian postnatal signaling system by widespread cow milk and dairy consumption in humans of industrialized societies has been proposed to be the major cause of the acne epidemic and the more serious chronic western diseases.” 	-	acne,bioactive molecules,cancer,dairy,dairy cows,diabetes,disease,estrogen,hormones,milk,National Dairy Council,obesity,sex hormones,skim milk,teenagers,whole milk	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hormones-in-skim-vs-whole-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-acne-promoting-effects-of-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/national-dairy-council-on-acne-and-milk/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hormones-in-skim-vs-whole-milk/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15692488,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/national-dairy-council-on-acne-and-milk/

A-445	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/07/05/do-eden-beans-have-too-much-iodine/	Do Eden Beans Have Too Much Iodine?	I love canned beans. Legumes in general—beans, peas, and lentils—are among the healthiest foods on the planet, and canned beans make it easy to boost the nutrition of nearly any dish. They are packed with potassium, fiber, and folate, and are a preferred source of protein. Worried about gas? Check out my blog Clearing the Air. Just as I encourage folks to keep a purple cabbage in their crisper to slice off shreds into whatever they may be eating (one of the best dietary bangs for our bucks), I’ve always recommended my patients keep an open can of beans in the fridge to spoon into whatever they happen to be eating throughout the day. Though we haven’t yet brought ourselves up to the British ideal (beans for breakfast!), I’m always trying to think of creative ways to sneak more into my family’s diet (black bean brownies anyone?). Eden Foods, the oldest organic food company in North America, deserves credit for being the first to remove the chemical bisphenol-A from the lining of their cans (see my video Which Plastics are Harmful?). They also add kombu (a sea vegetable also known as kelp) to their beans to improve flavor, digestibility, and nutrition. Sea vegetables represent the most concentrated dietary source of iodine (see Avoiding Iodine Deficiency), a nutrient that can be low in people eating otherwise healthy diets (see Pregnant Vegans at Risk for Iodine Deficiency). For those who don’t like the taste of seaweed and—for good reason—don’t use table salt, Eden brand beans can provide a healthy source of iodine. However, kombu is such a good source of iodine, it can actually provide too much. In my 2-min. video Too Much Iodine Can Be as Bad as Too Little I document a peculiar case in Australia of police raiding cafés to seize kombu-containing soymilk banned for containing too much iodine. Hoping to keep the SWAT team out of my pantry, I contacted Eden Foods to inquire about the iodine content of their beans. They claimed their beans had “1.17 mg iodine per 100 mg.” That’s obviously an error—there’s no way 1% of the can is iodine. I assumed they meant 1.17 mcg, since iodine is typically measured in millionths of a gram, not thousandths of a gram (for example, the recommended daily intake is 150 micrograms). Alternately, maybe they meant per 100 grams, which is a typical serving size. Either way, there still might be concerns about toxicity, as the tolerable upper limit is 1.1 mg a day, but I really wanted to get at the truth. I gently explained to them that the numbers they were quoting me couldn’t possibly be correct. If they were, then a can of their beans would exceed the potentially toxic daily dose of iodine set by the Institute of Medicine by more than 450,000%. In other words, a single can a year would put someone over the tolerable upper daily limit of intake! Incredibly, they insisted their numbers were accurate. I asked to speak to the lab. No response. I’ve talked to other nutrition professionals who contacted them and were told the same thing. Jeff Novick–one of my favorite dieticians–even got Whole Foods to inquire and still got nowhere. It’s so ironic. Normally when I challenge food companies, they make outrageous claims to try to paint their products in a more positive light; in this case, a company is insisting their food is much more toxic than it could possibly be.

A-446	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/28/fighting-inflammation-with-food-synergy/	Fighting Inflammation With Food Synergy	One of the reasons some studies haven’t shown more impressive results tying disease reduction to the quantity of fruit and vegetable consumption (see EPIC Study) may be because of quality of fruit and vegetable consumption. People are more likely to eat bananas than blueberries; cucumbers instead of kale. Berries are the healthiest fruits (see Best Berries) and greens are The Healthiest Vegetables. Variety is also important. We know, for example, spinach is healthier than lettuce (see #1 Anticancer Vegetable for a comparison of salad greens), and a big salad is better than small, but is it better to get the spring greens mesclun mix than even the straight spinach? Is it healthier to eat one apple and one orange than it is to eat three apples or three oranges? Though there are generic plant compounds like vitamin C that are found scattered throughout the plant kingdom, there are also specific phytonutrients produced by specific plants to perform specific functions—both in their organs and ours. We miss out on these if we’re stuck in a fruit and vegetable rut, even if we’re eating many servings a day. There are tens of thousands of these phytonutrients (see my 2-min. Phytochemicals: The Nutrition Facts Missing From the Label), but they’re not evenly distributed throughout the plant kingdom. Those wonderful glucosinolates I discuss in The Best Detox, Broccoli Versus Breast Cancer Stem Cells, and Lung Cancer Metastases and Broccoli, for example, are found almost exclusively in the cabbage family. Likewise, you won’t get lemonoids like lemonin and limonol or tangeretin in apples. Comparing apples and oranges is like, well, comparing apples and oranges. At the same time, all fruits are just fruits, whereas vegetables can be any other part of the plant. As I lay out in my 2-min. video Apples and Oranges: Dietary Diversity, roots harbor different nutrients than shoots. Carrots are roots, celery and rhubarb are stems, dark green leafies are leaves of course, peas are pods, and cauliflower is true to it’s name as a collection of flower buds, but all fruits are just fruits. The available evidence suggests it may be most important to get in a variety of vegetables so you can benefit from all the different parts of the plant. We know that whole foods are better than eating individual nutrients, for example a carrot is better than a beta carotene pill, because of what’s been called nutrient synergy where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, as many of the nutrients interact, work together, and complement one another. The same can be said of various food combinations. For example, I’ve talked about the wonders of the spice turmeric (Oxalates in Cinnamon), but the key component has very poor bioavailability. Just a tiny bit gets into your bloodstream after eating a nice curry—unless, you add some black pepper. The phytonutrient in black pepper boosts the absorption of the turmeric phytonutrient 2000%! That’s why dietary diversity is so important. In Garden Variety Anti-Inflammation I detail some recent studies that looked at disease risk and the variety of fruit and vegetable consumption. Researchers found no difference in inflammation between those eating 6 servings of vegetables a day and those eating 2 servings, but those eating the more variety—even if they didn’t necessarily eat greater overall quantities—ended up with significantly less inflammation in their bodies. This supports the American Heart Association’s latest dietary guidelines, which, for the first time, added a recommendation for also eating a variety of fruits and vegetables. 	-	American Heart Association,apple,beta carotene,black pepper,blueberries,broccoli,cabbage,carrots,disease,fruit,glucosinolates,kale,lemonin,lemonoids,limonol,mesclun,orange,phytonutrient,roots,spinach,tangeretin,turmeric,variety,vegetables,vitamin C	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspirin-levels-in-plant-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/epic-study/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-and-oranges-dietary-diversity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/garden-variety-anti-inflammation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9619120,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phytochemicals-the-nutrition-facts-missing-from-the-label/	
A-447	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/21/cows-milk-casomorphin-crib-death-and-autism/	Cow’s Milk Casomorphin, Crib Death, and Autism	Evolution devised an ingenious way to bond infant to mother: proteins in milk that break down into peptides that have opiate-like drug effects. But what if a breastfeeding mother is herself effectively suckling by still drinking milk into adulthood? Evolution never counted on that, which may explain a recent case report entitled “Cow’s Milk-Induced Infant Apnea With Increased Serum Content Of Bovine Beta Casomorphin 5” published in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. Casomorphin is one of the opioid compounds formed in our stomachs when we drink milk. Infant apnea refers to when a baby stops breathing. The researchers “report a case of a breast-fed infant with recurrent apnea episodes, which have always been preceded by his mother’s consumption of fresh cow’s milk.” Lab tests revealed a high level of casomorphin in the child’s blood, leading researchers to speculate that it was the “opioid activity that may have a depressive effect on the respiratory center in the central nervous system and induce a phenomenon called milk apnea.” “The aim of the present report,” the paper concludes, “is to draw researchers’ attention to the possibility of occurrence of a systemic reaction with an apnea seizure on the infant’s exposure to the proteins in cow’s milk. We are convinced that such a clinical situation occurs rarely; however, it is accompanied by a real threat to the infant’s life that can be avoided when applying a simple and not costly dietetic intervention…[a dairy-free diet]”. You can see more about the report in my 3-min. video Cow’s Milk-Induced Infant Apnea. The reason this is so concerning is that as many as 1 in 10 infants with recurrent apneic episodes cannot be saved and die of SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome (also known as crib death). SIDS is the leading cause of death for healthy infants after one month of age. One in every two thousand American babies dies this way. Every day six babies stop crying and twelve parents start. The suggestion that the opiate-like effects of a protein in cow’s milk could cause an infant to stop breathing was so provocative that researchers have started testing other high-risk kids. In my 2-min. video, Cow’s Milk Casomorphin and Crib Death, I detail a study in which the blood levels of the morphine-like peptides from cow milk averaged three times higher in infants with acute life-threatening episodes than those in healthy infants. It turns out there is an enzyme that gets rid of casomorphins, but the activity of that enzyme in the affected group was only half that of the healthy kids. Thus, some babies may just not be able to clear it out of their systems fast enough and are placed at risk for SIDS. The researchers conclude: “Penetration of beta-casomorphins into the infant’s immature central nervous system may inhibit the respiratory center in the brainstem leading to abnormal ventilatory responses, hypercapnia [too much carbon dioxide], hypoxia [not enough oxygen], apnea, and death.” The opiate-like casomorphins liberated from the cow’s milk protein, casein, are also accused of participating in the cause of other conditions including type I diabetes, postpartum psychosis, circulatory disorders, food allergies, and autism–the subject of my 2-min. video Cow’s Milk Casomorphin and Autism. 	-	apnea,baby,breastfeeding,casomorphin,cow's milk,crib death,death,enzymes,evolution,hypercapnia,hypoxia,infants,milk,mothers,opiate,peptides,protein,SIDS,stomach	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-casomorphin-and-crib-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-induced-infant-apnea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-casomorphin-and-autism/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-puberty/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-casomorphin-and-crib-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21478761,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-induced-infant-apnea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/flame-retardant-chemical-contamination-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cows-milk-casomorphin-and-autism/	
A-448	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/06/07/treating-copd-with-diet/	Treating COPD With Diet	The three top killers in the United States are no longer heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Stroke just moved down to number four. Number three is now COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, meaning respiratory disorders such as emphysema. We know we can prevent and even help treat the other top killers with diet (see, for example, Heart Disease: There Is a Cure and my 4-min. video Cancer Reversal Through Diet?), but what about COPD? Though most COPD is caused by tobacco, up to a third of COPD sufferers never smoked. The title of an editorial in this month’s issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition describes where some of the remainder of risk is coming from: “More Evidence for the Importance of Nutritional Factors in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.” As I explore in my 2-min. video Preventing COPD with Diet, data dating back 50 years found that high intake of fruits and vegetables was positively associated with lung function in general, but does that mean it could prevent COPD? There’s been a burst of new research over the last ten years to answer just that question. In 2002 we learned that every extra serving of fruit we add to our daily diet may reduce our risk of getting and then eventually dying from COPD. In 2006 we could add tea drinking to fruits and vegetables for COPD prevention. In 2007 a twin pair of studies emerged, one from Columbia and another from Harvard, implicating cured meats such as bacon, bologna, ham, hot dogs, sausage, and salami as a risk factor for developing COPD. They thought the nitrite preservatives in the meat might be mimicking the damage incurred by the nitrites from cigarette smoke (see my 2-min. video When Nitrites Go Bad for more). In 2008 Harvard decided to study women as well and came to the same conclusions. We know now what to go out of our way to eat and what to try to avoid. In 2009 soy was added to the good list; both tofu and soy milk were found to be protective agents against breathlessness. A 2010 article racked up the benefits of fiber, especially from whole grains, but “Impact of Dietary Shift to Higher-Antioxidant Foods in COPD: A Randomized Trial” was the study we’ve all been waiting for. Sure the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects of plant foods can help prevent COPD, but what if you already have the disease? One hundred and twenty COPD patients were randomized into two groups.  Half were told to eat at least one extra serving of fruits or vegetables per day, and the other half stayed on their regular diet. The lung function of the control group that wasn’t given any dietary advice slowly, but surely, got worse. That’s what tends to happen in diseases like emphysema–you get worse and worse and then you die. The lung function of the half eating an extra serving of fruits and vegetables every day started out the same, but did not get worse. In fact, if anything, it appeared that their lung function got progressively improved a little over the three years. That’s not supposed to happen; you’re supposed to get worse. View the graph accompanying my video Treating COPD with Diet. The researchers speculated it could be the antioxidant effects of fruits and vegetables or the anti-inflammatory properties, but recognized it may not be directly related to the plant foods at all. When you eat more of one thing, you tend to eat less of another. “For example,” the researchers noted, “the addition of fruit and vegetables resulted in a decreased consumption of meat, which is known to be a pro-oxidant.” Either way, though, there is now hope. The paper concludes: “These findings suggest that a dietary shift to higher-antioxidant food intake may be associated with improvement in lung function, and, in this respect, dietary interventions might be considered in COPD management.” The tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently. Instead of adding fruits and vegetables to ones diet to prevent emphysema, wouldn’t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes?  And indeed, a study was published on the addition of acai berries to cigarettes attempting to show a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice. The meat industry quickly followed suit. Blackberries “literally dyed burger patties…distinct purplish color,” experimenters lamented, though infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis set in did, evidently, improve tenderness. An experiment to improve the nutritional profile of hot dogs with powdered grape seeds flopped. There were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product, and if there’s one thing we know about hot dog eaters, it’s that they’re picky about what goes in their food :) -Michael Greger, M.D. 	-	acai berries,antioxidants,cancer,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,COPD,cured meats,diet,emphysema,fiber,fruit,heart disease,nitrites,soy,stroke,tea,tobacco,tofu,vegetables	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/treating-copd-with-diet/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21147193,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/166/12/1438.full.pdf+html,http://respiratory-research.com/content/pdf/1465-9921-10-56.pdf,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/171/7/776.full.pdf+html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-nitrites-go-bad/,http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v56/n7/pdf/1601370a.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20150206,http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/content/175/8/798.full.pdf+html,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2011/10/14/heart-disease-there-is-a-cure/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16782241,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/,http://www.ajcn.org/content/87/4/1002.full.pdf+html,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/video/preventing-copd-with-diet/	
A-449	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/31/watermelon-for-erectile-dysfunction/	Watermelon For Erectile Dysfunction	A disturbing analysis of mortality and morbidity was recently published in the Journal of Gerontology. Americans are living longer but sicker lives. We’re now living fewer healthy years. Compared to a decade ago, we live about a year longer, but come down with a serious disease like a stroke, cancer, or diabetes two years earlier. It’s like one step forward, two steps back. The UCLA researchers also tracked one’s capacity to function—for example, the ability to walk up 10 steps or kneel without using special equipment—and found a similar trend. In just a decade’s time, we now live more years with a serious illness and more years disabled, meaning we’re living longer in sickness, not in health; a longer lifespan, but shorter health span. The three leading causes of disability in the United States are arthritis, heart disease, and lower back pain, which all may be prevented, treated and in some cases even reversed with a healthy plant-based diet. For arthritis, see my 3-min. video Diet & Rheumatoid Arthritis; for cardiac disability, Heart Disease: There Is a Cure; and for degenerative disc disease, my 1-min. video Cholesterol and Lower Back Pain. Every part of the body needs sufficient blood to function properly. Cholesterol can clog arteries in our inner and outer organs, causing aneurisms, heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, spinal degeneration and sexual dysfunction. As noted in a recent article in the Harvard Health Letter, up to three­ quarters of men with cholesterol-­narrowed coronary arteries have some degree of erectile dysfunction. There are drugs like Viagra, but they’re considered temporary, expensive, stop-gap measures that may have a number of hazardous side-effects and don’t get to the root of the problem—the artery clogging atherosclerosis that threatens one’s life along with one’s love life. Not only may plant-based diets help preserve both, but as I feature in my 2-min. video Watermelon as Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction, one plant in particular may be able to play an interim role. The way drugs like Viagra work is by inhibiting an enzyme that inactivates something called cGMP, which would otherwise dilates penile blood vessels. Thus, enzyme inhibition means less inactivation, which means more cGMP, which means more blood flow. Another way to boost cGMP levels, though, is by going to the other side of the equation and stimulating the enzyme that makes it, which is a role played by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is made from arginine, arginine can be produced by citrulline, and so researchers tested men to see what would happen if they ate more citrulline. Their results were published in the journal Urology: “Oral Citrulline Supplementation Improves Erection Hardness in Men With Mild Erectile Dysfunction.” The consumption of citrulline allowed for a 68% increase in monthly intercourse frequency. The men were given supplements, but citrulline can be found naturally in watermelon. How much might one have to eat to match the dose they used in the study? Three and a half servings a day, but yellow water melon has about 4 times as much, so just a serving a day—one wedge, one sixteenth of a modest melon should work just as well. Although watermelon may indeed help treat the symptoms of pelvic atherosclerosis, it’s better to get to the root of the problem and clear out the arterial plaque.

A-450	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/17/poultry-and-penis-cancer/	Poultry and Penis Cancer	One of the reasons it’s so difficult to study the relationship between diet and cancer is because many dietary behaviors are associated with non-dietary behaviors. For example, one of the reasons we used to think coffee-drinking caused cancer was because people who drink coffee are more likely to have a cigarette in the other hand, which led to spurious conclusions. When you factor in those considerations, we find that coffee consumption may actually decrease cancer risk, as I detailed in Coffee and Cancer. The reason it was so difficult to study cancer among coffee-drinkers is the same reason it’s so difficult to study cancer among meateaters. Historically, those eating vegetarian have been noted to have lower cancer rates, but maybe it’s just because they exercise more, or smoke less, or inhale less diesel fumes because they all own a Prius :) In my 3 min. video Vegetarians Versus Healthy Omnivores I profiled new data that attempts to control for non-dietary factors by effectively comparing vegetarians only to meateaters who are as slim as vegetarians, exercise as much, smoke as little, and even eat roughly the same amount of fruits and vegetables. After all, maybe the reason vegetarians have been shown to be healthier is less about eating less meat, and more about eating more plants. Though these rigorous controls undercut key vegetarian advantages, such as lower obesity rates, even when vegetarians were compared in effect only to healthy meateaters with healthier diets, researchers still found “the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians.” The most striking difference between the dietary groups was in the risk for cancers of the blood and bone marrow, such as non-Hodgkins lymphoma, various leukemias, and myeloma (more details in my 2 min. video EPIC Findings on Lymphoma). Chicken consumption appeared the most hazardous, associated with up to triple the cancer rates for every 50 grams of daily poultry consumption—that’s just a quarter of a chicken breast worth! Why was there so much more lymphoma and leukemia risk among those eating just a small serving of chicken a day? As detailed in my 2 min. video Chicken Dioxins, Viruses, or Antibiotics?, the association between poultry and cancer may be explained by the presence in chickens’ and turkeys’ flesh of drugs that were fed to the birds, industrial carcinogens such as dioxins, and/or the presence of oncogenic (cancer-causing) viruses. In Poultry and Penis Cancer I present the largest study to date on poultry workers and cancer mortality, which found a whopping 8-fold increased risk of dying from penile cancer compared to controls, a finding thought due to chicken virus exposure, raising broader food safety concerns. If chickens can be infected with viruses linked to cancer in consumers, then what about eggs? Find out in Carcinogenic Retrovirus Found in Eggs. 	-	antibiotics,cancer,chicken,cigarettes,coffee,eggs,exercise,food safety,fruit,leukemia,lymphoma,myeloma,obesity,penis cancer,plants,poultry,raw poultry,vegetarian,viruses	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-poisoning-bacteria-cross-contamination/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-borne-infection-risk-from-shopping-carts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wart-cancer-virusesin-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/total-recall/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegetarians-versus-healthy-omnivores/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-greger-md/antibiotics-chicken_b_1470098.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/say-no-to-drugs-by-saying-yes-to-more-plants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/poultry-and-penis-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/carcinogenic-retrovirus-found-in-eggs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/epic-findings-on-lymphoma/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/chicken-dioxins-viruses-or-antibiotics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/wart-cancer-virusesin-food/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/	
A-451	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/10/coffee-caveats/	Coffee Caveats	Last month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, an editorial entitled “Coffee consumption and risk of chronic diseases: changing our views” reviewed the growing evidence that for most people, the benefits of drinking coffee likely outweigh the risks. For example, a recent analysis of the best studies published to date suggests coffee consumption may lead to a modest reduction in overall cancer incidence, as detailed in my 1-min. video Coffee and Cancer. Each daily cup o’ joe was associated with about a 3% reduced risk of cancers, especially bladder, breast, mouth, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, liver, leukemic, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. What about the caffeine, though? Glad you asked! Check out What About the Caffeine? There are a few caveats. Some health conditions may be worsened by coffee, such as insomnia, anxiety, gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn), high blood pressure, and certain heartbeat rhythm irregularities. There are also compounds in coffee that increase cholesterol levels, but are effectively removed when filtered through paper, so drip coffee is preferable to boiled, French press and espresso. Pregnant women should restrict caffeine consumption to less than two cups of coffee a day. Despite the growing evidence of health benefits associated with coffee consumption, I still don’t recommend people drink it—not because it’s not healthy, but because there are even healthier choices. In this way, coffee is like a banana, another common convenient plant product. If you have a choice, I’d encourage you to make healthier fruit choices (apples are better, berries are best). Similarly, when it comes to beverages, I’d encourage you to choose an even healthier one, like green tea. 	-	apples,bananas,berries,bladder,breast cancer,caffeine,cancer,cholesterol,chronic disease,coffee,colorectal cancer,Green tea,heartburn,high blood pressure,insomnia,liver cancer,prostate cancer	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-beverage/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/coffee-and-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-berries/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3066123/pdf/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22397855,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/what-about-the-caffeine/	
A-452	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/05/03/stool-size-and-breast-cancer-risk/	Stool Size and Breast Cancer Risk	Women eating plant-based diets may have lower breast cancer rates because they have larger bowel movements. In The Best Detox, I described the role of the liver in removing toxins from the blood stream, which can then be jettisoned through the bile into the digestive tract, and eliminated. Our gut is our body’s disposal system; anything it wants to get rid of, it throws down the trash chute. One can imagine our enterocytes, the cells lining our intestinal wall, as a vast array of trash pickers, resource recovery workers. They’re sifting through the river of garbage flowing past and picking up anything of use—a vitamin here, a mineral there, such that by the end there isn’t much left that’s desirable—and what’s left truly gets, ahem, dumped. The digestive tract is also how we get rid of excess hormones and cholesterol. Our body expects there to be an ever-flowing torrent of intestinal contents to flush this stuff out to sea. We did, after all, evolve over millions of years on a diet centered on unrefined plant foods. We aren’t designed for burgers and milkshakes; we are designed for fiber, and lots of it.  Anthropologists estimate we evolved eating 100 grams of fiber a day or more! So our body is counting on a massive, quick-flowing stream of contents through our digestive tract, and when there’s excess estrogen in the trash, our body expects it to just zip right out. But what if we don’t consume an adequate amount of fiber to soften and bulk up that intestinal flow? What if that river dries up into just a slow trickle of sludge? We still have the same number of trash pickers, but the volume and speed of the flow is way down, so they’re finding all sorts of stuff that otherwise would have been lost. Uh oh—that means they’re picking back up the estrogen that your body intentionally dumped, and thrusting it right back into the system. Fiber, on the contrary, dilutes, speeds, and bulks up the flow, so lots of stuff never even makes it to banks of the river to be picked at and inappropriately saved. My 4-min video Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen explains that this may be why women who eat lots of plants (the only place fiber is found) have lower estrogen levels and a lower risk of breast cancer. As I show in my 1-min video Food Mass Transit, meat-eating women average a four-day mouth-to-anus transit time, likely too long to meet the target 200 gram (half pound) minimum fecal output for cancer prevention. People don’t realize you can have daily bowel movements and still be effectively constipated. You can be regular, but four days late. In other words, what you’re flushing today you may have eaten last week. If you want to test it for yourself, all you need to do is eat a big bowl of beets and see when things turn pretty in pink. Ideally, to reach that half-pound target, your intestinal transit time should be down in the 24 to 36 hour range. 	-	beets,bowel movements,breast cancer,cholesterol,colon health,constipation,estrogen,fiber,stool size,transit time,women's health	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/bulking-up-on-antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hormones/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/stool-size-matters/	
A-453	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/26/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/	Breast Cancer Survival and Soy	In my two recent posts The Best Detox and Breast Cancer Stem Cells vs. Broccoli, I documented ways to 1) boost our liver’s ability to clear carcinogens, 2) make our DNA more resistant to toxins that make it past our first line of defense, and 3) then ramp up immune surveillance of any budding tumors—all in hopes of preventing cancer. But what about for those who already have it? Though small consolation, one consequence of the fact that breast cancer is now the #1 cancer killer of young women is that breast cancer survival is a very active area of research. For example, a major study was recently published that followed 4,000 women with breast cancer for 7 years. Not all of them made it to the end. The researchers tried to figure out if there was anything about the diets of the non-survivors that may have played a role in their deaths. Two dietary components in particular were associated with an early death: saturated fat and trans fat. Breast cancer survivors may decrease their risk of dying by 41% simply by avoiding saturated fat, found primarily in the American diet in cheese, chicken, and junk food (see my 3-minute video Breast Cancer Survival, Butterfat, and Chicken). And breast cancer survivors may improve their survival 78% by avoiding trans fat, found primarily in junk food and animal products (see my 1-minute video Breast Cancer Survival and Trans Fat). Ideally, everyone should try to minimize the intake of both, as explained in Trans Fat, Saturated Fat and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero. On the other hand, the two foods expected to improve breast cancer survival are flax seeds and soy products. Breast cancer is initially so slow-growing that women may have tumors for years or even decades before they’re diagnosed (see my 1-minute video Cancer Prevention and Treatment May Be the Same Thing). So one might expect that the same dietary factors that helped grow the tumor in the first place would keep goading it on after diagnosis. This may not always be the case, though. Alcohol, for example, is strongly associated with breast cancer risk, but the data has been mixed as to whether once you already have a full-blown tumor, it makes a difference if you continue to drink or not. Still, in general, the diet that helps prevent breast cancer is the same diet that’s going to help prolong survival. And that certainly seems to be the case for the phytonutrients found in flax and soy. Flax seeds are the most concentrated source of lignans, a class of cancer-fighting compounds that may cut breast cancer mortality risk in half (see my 3-minute video Breast Cancer Survival and Lignan Intake). Interestingly, there are no lignans actually found in the seeds, just precursors that the good bacteria in our gut turn into lignans. This may explain why women who have frequent urinary tract infections have higher breast cancer rates—the courses of antibiotics wipe out the gut flora critical to the production of these anti-cancer compounds (see my 2-minute Flax and Fecal Flora). 	-	alcohol,animal products,breast cancer,cancer,cheese,chicken,DNA,flax seeds,junk food,lignans,liver,phytonutrients,saturated fat,soy,trans fat	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/trans-fat-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-tolerable-upper-intake-of-zero/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2012/04/19/breast-cancer-stem-cells-vs-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/breast-cancer-survival-and-soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/breast-cancer-survival-and-trans-fat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/flax-and-fecal-flora/	
A-454	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/25/mad-cow-california-is-the-milk-supply-safe/	Mad Cow California: Is the Milk Supply Safe?	In announcing the detection of a new case of mad cow disease in California, the USDA emphasized that her carcass never made it into the food supply. The fact that the infected animal was a dairy cow, though, raises the question about the disposition of her milk. There’s currently no direct evidence that cow’s milk poses any mad cow risk, but when it comes to this mysterious class of diseases, we’ve learned time and time again that absence of evidence of risk, does not equal evidence of absence of risk. The USDA flatly declared that milk doesn’t transmit mad cow disease, but that’s what we used to think about scrapie, the parallel disease in sheep, before research in the last 5 years unequivocally demonstrated that milk could indeed become contaminated with prions, the infectious proteins that cause these transmissible sponge-like (spongiform) brain diseases (encephalopathies). Similar experiments have not detected infectivity in mad cow milk, but this may be a function of the limited sensitivity of testing methods. And we have no such data on the atypical strain of mad cow disease found in California, which research suggests is more “lymphotrophic,” meaning more likely to invade the lymph system, which could mean mean milk is more likely to become infected. If prions are present at low levels in bovine milk, then this could present a particular problem in the United States, since inflammation has been shown to dramatically boost the infectivity of prion-infected milk and there is an epidemic of mastitis in the U.S. dairy herd. Last year researchers demonstrated that the ingestion of as little as 1 to 2 quarts of milk from scrapie-infected sheep stricken with mastitis could cause prion infection in lambs at an attack rate of 86%. This is thought to be because the prions may concentrate in the blood and pus cells sloughed into milk from inflamed udders. Today’s dairy cows endure annual cycles of artificial insemination, pregnancy and birth, and mechanized milking for 10 out of 12 months (including 7 months of their 9-month pregnancies). This excessive metabolic drain overburdens the cows, who are considered “productive” for only two years and are slaughtered for hamburger when their profitability drops, typically around their fourth birthday, a small fraction of their natural lifespan. Turning dairy cows into milk machines has led to epidemics of so-called “production-related diseases,” such as lameness and mastitis, the two leading causes of dairy cow pre-slaughter mortality in the United States. 	-	bovine spongiform encephalopathy,bse,mad cow disease,milk,pus	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/08/how-much-pus-is-there-in-milk/	-	-	-	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16270061,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807697/pdf/prion0304_0236.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3020009/pdf/2022-10.pdf,http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy07/Dairy07_dr_PartII.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268960/pdf/prion0404_0275.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2268471/pdf/2561-07.pdf,http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/87/8/2433.full.pdf+html	
A-455	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/19/breast-cancer-stem-cells-vs-broccoli/	Breast Cancer Stem Cells vs. Broccoli	In my post The Best Detox, I detailed how a phytonutrient in broccoli boosts the detoxifying enzymes in the liver. But helping to clear carcinogens isn’t the only way greens protect our DNA. A study of the DNA of broccoli-eaters found that eating broccoli appears to make DNA more resistant to damage, as I explore in my one-minute video, DNA Protection from Broccoli. That was just one of several extraordinary studies published lately on cruciferous vegetables. Kale and the Immune System compares the immune system-boosting effect of cooked versus raw kale, a follow-up on my Best Cooking Method video. Smoking Versus Kale Juice looks at the Japanese health fad of doing shots of kale juice. Seems kale can boost our good cholesterol, like amla and cocoa. Is there anything kale can’t do? Broccoli Versus Breast Cancer Stem Cells documents the most important study of the lot, though, exploring the role phytonutrients in certain greens play in a new theory of cancer biology, cancer stem cells, which explains why breast cancer can relapse 25 years after you thought it went away. Sure, cruciferous vegetables produce a compound that appears to target breast cancer cells, but that’s in a test tube. How do we even know we absorb broccoli phytonutrients into our bloodstream? And even if we do, how much do we have to eat to arrive at the test tube concentrations featured in the studies where it counts—in breast tissue itself? An innovative group at Johns Hopkins figured it out. They found women scheduled for breast reduction surgery, and an hour before they went into the operating room, had them drink some broccoli sprout juice. Check out my 2-minute video Sulforaphane: From Broccoli to Breast to see what they found. Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer of young women, but lung cancer is the #1 cancer killer of women overall. In my 3-minute Lung Cancer Metastases and Broccoli I talk about some fascinating new research on the effects of broccoli on cancer cell migration, suggesting that broccoli and broccoli sprouts may decrease the metastatic potential of lung cancer. Worried about the safety of raw sprouts? You’re probably thinking about alfalfa (Don’t Eat Raw Alfalfa Sprouts and Update on Alfalfa Sprouts). Broccoli sprouts appear much safer in terms of the risk of food poisoning (as noted in Broccoli Sprouts). We know this family of vegetables helps prevent cancer, but once you already have cancer, what dietary changes can one make to improve survival? Raw Broccoli and Bladder Cancer Survival completed my 13-video series on the latest research on cruciferous vegetables. I previously covered a bit of the prevention side of the story in The Healthiest Vegetables. Wasn’t there some report downplaying the role of fruits and vegetables in cancer prevention, though? Watch my 2-minute take on it in EPIC Study. 	-	alfalfa,amla,bladder cancer,breast cancer,broccoli,cancer,carcinogen,cholesterol,cocoa,DNA,enzymes,EPIC,greens,kale,liver,lung cancer,phytonutrient,raw,sprouts	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cocoa-good-chocolate-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-healthiest-vegetables/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/broccoli-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/lung-cancer-metastases-and-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dna-protection-from-broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dont-eat-raw-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cocoa-good-chocolate-bad/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-cooking-method/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/kale-and-the-immune-system/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/smoking-versus-kale-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/update-on-alfalfa-sprouts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/raw-broccoli-and-bladder-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/sulforaphane-from-broccoli-to-breast/	
A-456	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/04/12/the-best-detox/	The Best Detox	As detailed in my 3-minute video The Best Detox, there’s lots of talk these days about detoxing, but talk is cheap—our liver is actually doing it, all day, every day. If we want to detoxify our bodies, the best thing we can do is to boost our liver’s own detoxifying enzymes, and one of the most potent such inducer is a phytonutrient called sulforaphane. So where do we find this stuff?  Broccoli, which produces more than any other known plant (with the silver going to kohlrabi and bronze to cauliflower; broccoli raab, on the other hand, produces about 500 times less than broccoli). Broccoli is an exceptional source of sulforaphane, but the surprising thing is that there’s none actually in the vegetable—until you bite it. You know those chemical flares, or glow sticks, where you snap them and chemicals in two different compartments mix and set off a reaction? Broccoli does the same thing. In one part of the cell it keeps the enzyme myrosinase, and in another part it keeps something called glucoraphanin. There is no sulforaphane, which is what we want, anywhere in broccoli—not until some herbivore starts chewing on it. At that point, plant cells get crushed, the enzyme mixes with the glucoraphanin and sulforaphane is born.  And the herbivore is like, “Ew, this tastes like broccoli!” and runs away. The plant uses this as a defense against nibblers and noshers. Little did broccoli count on a little lemon juice and some garlic—maybe a little tahini dressing? It’s our counterattack. A similar enzymatic “glow stick” reaction happens in garlic. Both the enzymes in both these cases are inactivated by cooking, so there’s a secret to preserving the benefits. See Sometimes the Enzyme Myth Is True for my “hack & hold” strategy (or maybe I should call it whack & wait?) 	-	broccoli,broccoli sprouts,cauliflower,coffee,cooking,detox,enzymes,garlic,glow stick,glucoraphanin,goji berries,herbivore,kelp,liver,plants,sulforaphane,tea,turmeric	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-iodine-can-be-as-bad-as-too-little/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/biggest-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/overdosing-on-greens/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/how-much-broccoli-is-too-much/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/liver-toxicity-due-to-broccoli-juice/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/overdosing-on-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-best-detox/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-iodine-can-be-as-bad-as-too-little/	
A-457	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/03/22/using-greens-to-improve-athletic-performance/	Using Greens to Improve Athletic Performance	Earlier this month I completed a 17-part video series on the performance-enhancing effects of certain vegetables. It started with Doping with Beet Juice, which described how beets were the first to be found to significantly improve athletic performance while reducing oxygen needs, upsetting a fundamental tenet of sports physiology. How is that possible? Check out Priming the Proton Pump to nerd out on a bit of biochemistry. Next up was Don’t Use Antiseptic Mouthwash, which describes the role the natural good bacteria flora on our tongue plays in the performance-boosting effect of high nitrate vegetables, and Out of the Lab onto the Track, which documented the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that convinced the scientific establishment of the real-world effect. Asparagus Pee and Pretty in Pee-nk go off on a tangent to delve into the phenomenon of “beeturia,” the chief side effect of beet consumption–though not all are affected, akin to the malodorous urine that sometimes results from asparagus consumption. If our bodies can turn the nitrate in vegetables into the vasodilator nitric oxide, then performance enhancement may be just the tip of the iceberg. Indeed, as I explain in Hearts Shouldn’t Skip a Beet, this may help explain the role dark green leafy vegetables play in the prevention and treatment of hypertension and heart disease. So which vegetables have the mostest? Find out in Vegetables Rate by Nitrate. If the nitrates in vegetables such as greens are health-promoting because they can be turned into nitrites and then nitric oxide inside our bodies, what about the nitrites added to cured meats such as bacon, ham, and hot dogs? This is the apparent conundrum I present in Is Bacon Good or Is Spinach Bad? and then solve in Are Nitrates Pollutants or Nutrients? but not before laundry-listing the health concerns associated with processed meats. In When Nitrites Go Bad I describe how nitrites added to processed meat form nitrosamines, a class of potent cancer-causing agents found in cigarette smoke that may explain why hot dog consumption has been associated with the two leading pediatric cancers, brain tumors and childhood leukemia. So which meat has the highest level of these carcinogens? In Prevention Is Better Than Cured Meat the levels of nitrosamines are compared across an array of processed meats including chicken, turkey, and pork. And finally, bacon. Carcinogens in the smell of frying bacon is pretty self-explanatory. In Bacon and Botulism I talk about the incredible story of regulators forced to strike a balance between the risk that consumers will get cancer, and the risk that they’ll get a deadly form of food poisoning. Part of that balance is the legal mandate to add certain antioxidants to processed meats, though I explore the irony in Vitamin C-Enriched Bacon that this may make the meat even more carcinogenic. Finally, in Meat Additives to Diminish Toxicity, I feature an article published in the journal Meat Science revealing how meat scientists continue to justify promoting foods associated with promoting cancer. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-additives-to-diminish-toxicity/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/asparagus-pee/	
A-458	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/03/15/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/	Harvard's Meat & Mortality Studies	On Monday, the results of two major Harvard studies were published, following more than 100,000 men and women—and their diets—for up to 22 years. They found that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality. The studies were featured in the NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day yesterday, Harvard’s Meat & Mortality Studies. The American Meat Institute immediately sent out a press release: “A new study in today’s Archives of Internal Medicine tries to predict the future risk of death from cancer or cardiovascular disease by relying on notoriously unreliable self-reporting about what was eaten and obtuse methods to apply statistical analysis to the data.” Alas, yes, the Harvard researchers were not telepathic and did indeed have to ask people what they were eating. The Meat Institute criticized the esteemed researchers for using “survey data – not test tubes, microscopes or lab measurements….” No beakers either, I bet! Nor sizzling electric arcs, nor panels with pretty flashing lights. No, just cutting edge epidemiological science, however “obtuse” this may be to the American Meat Institute. The Meat Institute asserted that “nutrition decisions should be based on the total body of evidence, not on single studies….” If two prospective cohort studies—the gold standard of observational studies—following more than 100,000 people for two decades published by one of the most prestigious institutions in the world isn’t good enough for the Meat Institute, how about the largest such study ever—the NIH-AARP study, “Meat Intake and Mortality: A Prospective Study of Over Half a Million People.” What does the largest forward-looking study on diet and disease in human history have to say on the subject?

A-459	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/02/02/atkins-diet-and-erectile-dysfunction/	Atkins Diet and Erectile Dysfunction 	Yesterday’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day, Atkins Diet: Trouble Keeping It Up, discusses a case report of a man who went on a low carb diet, lost his ability to have an erection, and nearly lost his life. That was just one person, though. Researchers at Harvard recently looked at one hundred thousand people and concluded that low carb diets were “associated with higher all-cause mortality, higher cardiovascular disease mortality, and higher cancer mortality.” But what about the so-called “Eco-Atkins” diet? Find out in today’s video, Plant-Based Atkins Diet. And for more on erectile dysfunction as an early warning sign for heart disease, check out my video Rosy Glow. Cholesterol builds up not only inside the arteries that feed our heart muscle, but inside all of our blood vessels. In the heart, atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack. In the brain, it can cause a stroke. In our legs, it can cause peripheral vascular disease and result in debilitating cramping; in our vertebral arteries, it can cause disc degeneration and lower back pain. And clogs in our pelvic arteries can lead to sexual dysfunction—and not just in men. A landmark study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine entitled “Hyperlipidemia and sexual function in premenopausal women” found that “Atherosclerosis of the arterial bed supplying female pelvic anatomy can lead to decreased vaginal engorgement and clitoral erectile insufficiency syndrome, similar to erectile problems in men, resulting in vasculogenic female sexual dysfunction,” an important factor of which may be “failure to achieve clitoral tumescence, or engorgement.” They found that women with high cholesterol reported significantly lower arousal, orgasm, lubrication, and satisfaction. 	-	atherosclerosis,Atkins,carbs,cholesterol,eco-Atkins,erectile dysfunction,Harvard,heart attack,heart disease,low carb,stroke	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/plant-based-atkins-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/atkins-diet-trouble-keeping-it-up/,http://annals.org/content/153/5/289.full.pdf+html

Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods presents the best bird’s eye view. Researchers separated out plant from animal products to help deal with the overwhelming volume of data (138 pages worth) and see what this amazing body of work has to say about what we should eat in general. For more specifics, see Best Berries, which compares hundreds of berries to common fruits, and Better Than Green Tea?, which contrasts the antioxidant power of popular rival beverages. Better Than Goji Berries and Dried Apples Versus Cholesterol pick out the best dried fruits and Antioxidants in a Pinch and A Better Breakfast can help one visualize the effects of adding just tiny amounts of antioxidant-packed foods to our daily diets.

A-461	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/18/paula-deen-diabetes-drug-spokesperson/	Paula Deen: diabetes drug spokesperson 	The year before he died of lung cancer, actor Yul Brynner taped a commercial for the American Cancer Society. “Now that I’m gone,” he pleaded into the camera, “I tell you: Don’t smoke, whatever you do, just don’t smoke.” He didn’t want anyone else to end up like him. Celebrity chef Paula Deen, known for using doughnuts to bun her bacon-and-egg burgers, could have used her diabetes diagnosis in the same way, in hopes that others wouldn’t make the same mistakes. Instead, she announced yesterday, she is partnering “with a reputable pharmaceutical company” as spokesperson for a $500-a-month diabetes drug (with side-effects that may include pancreatitis and thyroid cancer). Instead of withdrawing her endorsements for Smithfield ham and Philadelphia cream cheese, Paula Deen just added another to the list. It would be as if Yul Brynner’s last breaths were instead spent hawking chemo. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, nontraumatic amputations, and new cases of blindness. Currently it’s the 7th leading cause of death in the United States. The good news Paula could have given to the millions of diabetics and prediabetics is that type 2 diabetes can be prevented, managed, treated, and even cured with a plant-based diet. A prospective study of nearly 20,000 vegetarians and vegans published recently found that even after controlling for obesity (and exercise, age, gender, education, income, television watching, sleep, alcohol use, and smoking), those that ate plant-based diets had just a fraction of the diabetes risk. See How to Prevent Diabetes, How to Treat Diabetes, and my other 20 videos on diabetes. Good books on the subject include Dr. Neal Barnard’s Program for Reversing Diabetes and Defeating Diabetes. 	-	blindness,burgers,butter balls,diabetes,doughnuts,Dr. Neal Barnard,drugs,Graham Kerr,kidney failure,pancreatitis,Paula Deen,pharmaceuticals,Philadelphia cream cheese,Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,plant-based diet,Smithfield ham,The Galloping Gourmet,thyroid cancer,United States,Yul Brynner	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://youtu.be/zv8yEMRDe_w,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21952951,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983060,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51264427,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/how-to-prevent-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/how-to-treat-diabetes/

Trail mix has been my standby, a homespun mix of nuts and dried fruit that has evolved as I’ve learned more over the years.  When USDA released new antioxidant data in 2007 I switched to pecans (see The Best Nut) and golden raisins (see The Healthiest Raisin). Then I found out that goji berries had five times more antioxidants than raisins (see Antioxidant Content of 300 Foods), making them one of the best Superfood Bargains. And that was before I figured out how to buy them even cheaper than raisins! (see Are Goji Berries Good for You?). That was all before the landmark paper “The Total Antioxidant Content of More Than 3100 Foods…” was published, though. I added dried apple rings to the mix, given the preliminary anti-inflammatory data reported in last Tuesday’s video-of-the-day Dried Apples Versus Cholesterol and started exploring the newest front-runners, as detailed in Wednesday’s Better Than Goji Berries. Leading the pack by a whopping margin (200 times the antioxidant content of blueberries!) were Indian gooseberries, also known as amla or amalika. 	-	amalika,amla,antioxidants,apple,Ayurveda,dried fruit,goji berries,Green tea,Indian gooseberries,nuts,pecans,plant foods,raisins,saffron,snacks,trail mix	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/	http://www.drgreger.org/dates.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-content-of-300-foods-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dried-apples-versus-cholesterol/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-raisin-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/amla-versus-cancer-cell-invasion/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/better-than-goji-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/amla-versus-diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-best-nut-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/superfood-bargains-2/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21317655,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841576/pdf/1475-2891-9-3.pdf	
A-463	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/10/plant-based-benefits-extend-beyond-the-top-killers/	Plant-Based Benefits Extend Beyond the Top Killers	The Adventist Health Studies offer some of the best science on the impacts of plant-based diets on health and longevity. Based in California, they include both the longest running study of vegetarians in history as well as the largest contingent of vegans. While most of the attention on the benefits of plant-based eating have focused on reduced rates of many of the top killers, such as heart disease, cancer, strokes, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure, the Adventist Health Study—started back in 1974—offered insight into how broadly the potential health benefits may extend. My video-of-the-day Preventing Allergies in Adulthood (a follow-up to Preventing Childhood Allergies last week), presented findings from the Adventist Health Study showing that women eating plant-based diets were found to have a 30% lower chance of reporting chemical allergies, 24% less asthma, 17% less drug and bee-sting allergies, and 15% less hay fever, though men eating plant-based appeared to have lower risk only of chemical and drug allergies. This was cross-sectional data, meaning it was just a slice in time, so we don’t necessarily know which came first. Still, after adjusting for other factors such as smoking, the findings do suggest a favorable effect of a plant-based diet on the prevalence of allergies. 	-	Adventist Health Study,allergies,antacids,aspirin,asthma,blood pressure,blood pressure medications,cancer,diabetes,heart disease,insulin,laxatives,obesity,pain-killers,sleeping pills,stroke,tranquilizers	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/preventing-allergies-in-adulthood/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hypertension/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/diabetes/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/stroke/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/obesity/	
A-464	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/08/hibiscus-tea-flower-power/	Hibiscus tea: flower power	In Friday’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day Better Than Green Tea? I compare the antioxidant content of a number of common beverages. This is part of a series based on the landmark study “The total antioxidant content of more than 3100 foods, beverages, spices, herbs and supplements used worldwide,” available full-text, free online. Previous video installments include Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods and Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods Versus Animal Foods. Most people eat only a few discrete times a day. Sipping a healthful beverage throughout the day allows you to bathe your organs in antioxidants all day long, potentially adding Nutrition Without Calories to our daily diet. Previously my family’s go-to beverage was cold-brewed matcha white tea with lemon, based on the science I covered in The Healthiest Beverage, Cold Steeping Green Tea, Is Matcha Good for You? and Green Tea vs. White. But that was before 283 different beverages were tested in this new study. I had previously covered more than a dozen herbal teas in The Healthiest Herbal Tea, but nothing prepared me for the new king of the hill, hibiscus. When it comes to antioxidant content, hibiscus beats out green tea, but hibiscus still lacks the weight of clinical evidence. There are only a few hundred studies published on hibiscus, compared to thousands on green tea, but hibiscus does appear to have anti-inflammatory properties, help lower high blood pressure, help lower uric acid levels in gout sufferers, and improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels in pre-diabetics and diabetics. Like chamomile (see Red Tea, Honeybush, & Chamomile), hibiscus tea also appears to inhibit the growth of human cancer cells in a petri dish. You know there’s something to it when the meat industry tries adding hibiscus to their burgers to make them less carcinogenic. Rats forced to drink the human equivalent of about a 150 cups a day for three months had lowered sperm counts, but no adverse effects on humans have been reported with regular consumption. My only cautions would be that like a number of fruit, vegetable, and herbal beverages, hibiscus may affect drug levels, so you should always let your prescribing physicians know what you’re taking, and the impressive manganese content of hibiscus tea may exceed recommended limits at high intakes, so we probably shouldn’t drink more than a quart a day. 	-	antioxidants,beverage,calories,chamomile,dates,erythritol,Green tea,herbal tea,hibiscus,matcha,white tea	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-without-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-matcha-good-for-you/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/green-tea-vs-white/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19678781,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19765963,http://1.usa.gov/1swS1ao,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://www.facebook.com/paulshapiro,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-beverage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-healthiest-herbal-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/better-than-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-without-calories/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/pink-juice-with-green-foam/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18423919,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418021,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15019726,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/red-tea-honeybush-chamomile-2/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10404421,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19962289,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-matcha-good-for-you/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21291361,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17094172,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841576/pdf/1475-2891-9-3.pdf	
A-465	http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/01/05/epa-dioxin-limit-has-national-chicken-council-worried-products-could-be-declared-unfit-for-consumption/	EPA dioxin limit has National Chicken Council worried products could be declared "unfit for consumption"	Dioxin, industrial pollutant of Agent Orange infamy, has been called “the most toxic compound synthesized by man.” Not only is dioxin considered a known human carcinogen, adverse health effects may include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, endometriosis, early menopause, reduced testosterone and thyroid hormones, altered metabolism and immune responses, and skin, tooth, and nail abnormalities. Exposure during pregnancy can result in altered thyroid, brain, immune system, and reproductive organ development. The Environmental Protection Agency start testing Americans’ tissues for dioxin levels back in 1982, and after 3 decades of delay is releasing new guidelines this month that would set limits on the safe exposure of U.S. consumers to this class of toxic chemicals. In response, the National Chicken Council, American Meat Institute, and other industry groups complained to the White House that their products “could arbitrarily be classified as unfit for consumption.” But the classification wouldn’t be arbitrary at all; it would be based on the level of dioxin contamination in the food. Warning consumers about the risk could “scare the crap out of people,” the industry groups contend, and “have a significant negative economic impact on all U.S. food producers.” But that’s not true either. According to the Food and Drug Administration, “over 95% [of dioxin exposure is] coming through dietary intake of animal fats.” The only reason “nearly every American – particularly young children – could easily exceed the daily RfD [reference dose exposure limit] after consuming a single meal” is because Americans currently eat so much meat, eggs, and dairy. Consumer food safety champion Caroline Smith DeWaal praised the EPA’s decision to set a dioxin safety limit but stressed the agency needs to take it a step further: “Having a limit is always a good thing, but consumers will need to know how to translate it into their daily diet.” Eating low on the food chain is the best strategy to reduce one’s risk, but does not eliminate exposure (see Industrial Pollutants in Vegans). In my Dioxins in the Food Supply video I run through the latest USDA and EPA survey data of the level of dioxins and dioxin-like pollutants in the American food supply. 	-	American Meat Institute,cardiovascular disease,chicken,diabetes,dioxins,endometriosis,Environmental Protection Agency,EPA,fish,fish oil,Food and Drug Administration,International Ice Cream Association,menopause,mercury,metabolism,National Cheese Institute,National Chicken Council,PCB,pregnancy,salmon,testosterone,thyroid	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-pollutants-in-vegans/,http://www.cattlenetwork.com/cattle-news/EPAs-dioxin-dilemma-puts-farmers-ranchers-in-a-pickle-136692898.html?ref=898,http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodContaminantsAdulteration/ChemicalContaminants/DioxinsPCBs/ucm077524.htm,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/farmed-fish-vs-wild-caught-2/,http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=38484,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hair-testing-for-mercury/,http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203899504577131094244269500.html,http://www.idfa.org/files/resources/final_coalition_dioxin_letter_120711.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free/,http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action;jsessionid=361FA2ED2FC857DDC3C41A992DE45F33?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.7219&representation=PDF,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-problem-with-organic-salmon/,http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/09/us/dioxin-use-on-arkansas-rice-raises-concern-about-health.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2788749/pdf/nihms150859.pdf

A-467	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/23/generic-lipitor-is-not-the-answer-to-our-heart-disease-epidemic/	Generic Lipitor is not the answer to our heart disease epidemic	The cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor (atorvastatin) is the best-selling drug on the planet. Nearly a million Americans filled their prescriptions the first week after it went generic this month. Over the past 25 years, this one drug raked in $100 billion in sales. Although as a class, the statin drugs are remarkably safe, there is concerning new evidence I reviewed in my video Statin Muscle Toxicity that even people who don’t experience pain or weakness on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs may be suffering muscle damage, which may increase the risk of falls in older men and women. This is nothing, though, compared to the risk of elevated cholesterol, the primary risk factor for our primary cause of death, heart disease. Is that our choice, though? Taking drugs for the rest of our lives to reduce the risk of damage to our heart muscle at the risk of damaging our skeletal muscles? No, according to the editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Cardiology, Dr. William Clifford Roberts. In my video-of-the-day on Wednesday, Heart Attacks and Cholesterol: Purely a Question of Diet, I profile his new editorial “It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid!”. “For the build-up of plaque in our arteries to cease,” Dr. Roberts writes, “it appears that the serum total cholesterol needs to be lowered to the 150 area. In other words the serum total cholesterol must be lowered to that of the average pure vegetarian. Because relatively few persons are willing to abide by the vegetarian lifestyle, lipid-lowering drugs are required in most to reach the 150 level.” He concludes: “Whether or not we are willing to alter our diet sufficiently and/or to spend the money necessary to obtain the lipid-lowering drugs, and then take them religiously to achieve this goal is up to us.” In my Heart Attacks and Cholesterol videos on Monday and Tuesday, Dying Under Normal Circumstances and Agribusiness Sees It Differently, I cover new data from hundreds of hospitals on people admitted for heart attacks, suggesting that the current cholesterol guidelines are too lax. The average LDL (“bad cholesterol”) of those hospitalized was under 130, in the official normal range, but well above the LDL limit recommended by Dr. Roberts (under 60). Having a “normal” cholesterol in a society where it’s normal to die of heart disease is not necessarily a good thing. In Convergence of Evidence, Dr. Dean Ornish talks about the advantages of choosing diet over drugs to reach cholesterol goals. Unlike statins, a plant-based diet can prevent and treat other chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity at the same time. His research shows that living and eating healthy can actually change us on a genetic level, up-regulating disease-preventing genes and down-regulating genes that promote breast cancer, prostate cancer, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Drugs can’t do that, but diet can. Cardiologists are realistic, though. They know not everyone is going to shift to a more plant-based diet, which brings us to yesterday’s video-of-the-day, Fast food: Do You Want Fries With That? Lipitor? “We envisage a future in which fast food restaurants encourage a holistic approach to healthy living,” wrote a group of prominent cardiologists. “On ordering an unhealthy meal, the food will arrive labeled with a warning message similar to those found on cigarette packets (‘This meal increases your risk for heart disease and death’), and on the tray, next to the ketchup, will be a new and protective packet, ‘McStatin,’ which could be sprinkled onto a Quarter Pounder or into a milkshake. This could easily be provided at no extra charge, just as sugar and salt.” That’s modern medicine’s idea of a “holistic” approach, drugs with every Happy Meal. Others advocate for a more aggressive approach: the “polypill,” 5 drugs wrapped into one, a statin, three blood pressure medications—a thiazide, beta blocker, and an ACE inhibitor—and some aspirin. The balance of benefits versus risks of life-threatening side-effects continues to be hotly debated within the medical community. I’m sympathetic to the drug-pushers’ arguments. Look, we have filters on cigarettes for people who continue to smoke, why not have drugs for people who continue to eat unhealthfully? Though the ideal, of course, is for people to quit their bad habits. In this morning’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day, Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero, I detail how to prevent heart disease naturally by avoiding the three things that increase bad cholesterol: 1) trans fats, which come mostly from junk food and animal products, 2) saturated fat, mostly from dairy products and chicken, and 3) dietary cholesterol, the leading sources being eggs and poultry. Any intake above zero appears to increase LDL cholesterol, so consumption of meat, eggs, dairy, and junk food should be as low as possible. 	-	American Journal of Cardiology,cancer,cholesterol,cigarettes,diabetes,dietary cholesterol,Dr. Dean Ornish,Dr. William Clifford Roberts,eggs,fast food,Happy Meal,heart attack,heart disease,LDL,Lipitor,meat,muscle damage,obesity,plant-based diet,polypill,poultry,saturated fat,statins,trans fat	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/statins/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/statin-muscle-toxicity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-purely-a-question-of-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-agribusiness-sees-it-differently/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/heart-attacks-and-cholesterol-dying-under-normal-circumstances/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/convergence-of-evidence/	
A-468	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/15/vitamin-d-shedding-some-light-on-the-new-recommendations/	Vitamin D: Shedding some light on the new recommendations	Earlier this year, the U.S. Institute of Medicine upped their official vitamin D recommendation for most adults from 200 to 600 IU a day. Where did they get the original number, why did they triple it, and why are there those who recommend people take thousands a day rather than hundreds? Though the IOM report has been considered “the most comprehensive document on vitamin D nutrition to date,” it raised intense controversy in the scientific community, culminating with the publication of conflicting guidelines recommending 1,500-2,000 IU a day from the American Endocrine Society, the world’s oldest, largest, and most active organization devoted to hormone research (“vitamin” D is a misnomer; it’s actually a hormone). When even the consensus committee expert panels disagree, where can you turn? Ideally, the answer is the primary source literature, but this is no small task given that more than 3,000 new journal articles were published on vitamin D in the last year alone. This last week of NutritionFacts.org videos has been my attempt to provide justification for my own vitamin D recommendation based on my understanding of the best available science. In Vitamin D Recommendations Changed, I start out by explaining the rationale behind the Institute of Medicine’s change of heart. In Evolutionary Argument For Optimal Vitamin D Level the IOM’s target blood level of vitamin D is questioned (given the fact that we evolved running around naked in equatorial Africa). The Institute of Medicine’s conservative position on vitamin D is understandable, though, given the history of hyped vitamin supplements that turned out worthless or worse, as I review in Is Vitamin D the New Vitamin E? The official vitamin D recommendation is based on bone health, as the IOM considers the extraskeletal benefits unproven. Others cite evidence that taking 2,000 IU a day may reduce “risk for autoimmune diseases; deadly cancers including prostate, colon, and breast cancer; type II diabetes; heart disease; cognitive dysfunction; and infectious disease.” I jump straight to overall mortality in Vitamin D and Mortality May Be a U-Shaped Curve, suggesting that both too little and too much may adversely affect longevity. Why not just rely on the sun? Vitamin D Supplements May Be Necessary sheds light on the fact that even under optimal sun exposure, many people will not reach circulating D levels associated with the lowest overall mortality. Everyone responds differently to supplements, though, making it challenging to formulate one-size-fits-all guidelines, as shown in The Difficulty of Arriving at a Vitamin D Recommendation. How the Institute of Medicine Arrived at Their Vitamin D Recommendation shows how they used the body’s own reaction to protect bone health to come up with their guidelines, whereas yesterday’s video-of-the-day, Resolving the Vitamin D-bate, extends that logic to tap into the entire body’s innate wisdom. This morning, the series concludes with Take Vitamin D Supplements With Meals, suggesting a cost-effective strategy to achieve optimum levels. 	-	American Endocrine Society,bone health,Institute of Medicine,vitamin D	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-d/	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/?p=4060,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22017772,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21646368,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vitamin-d-recommendations-changed/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/how-the-institute-of-medicine-arrived-at-their-vitamin-d-recommendation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/resolving-the-vitamin-d-bate,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vitamin-d-supplements-may-be-necessary/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/evolutionary-argument-for-optimal-vitamin-d-level/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-difficulty-of-arriving-at-a-vitamin-d-recommendation/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vitamin-d-and-mortality-may-be-a-u-shaped-curve/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21415774,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22vitamin%20d%22%5BMeSH%20Terms%5D%20OR%20%22vitamin%20d%22%5BAll%20Fields%5D%20OR%20%22ergocalciferols%22%5BMeSH%20Terms%5D%20OR%20%22ergocalciferols%22%5BAll%20Fields%5D&cmd=DetailsSearch,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-vitamin-d-the-new-vitamin-e/	
A-469	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/12/05/beans-and-gas-clearing-the-air/	Beans & Gas: Clearing the Air	More than a decade ago, the Quarterly Journal of Medicine published a review entitled: “Vegetarian Diet: Panacea for modern lifestyle disease?” The answer was in the affirmative, noting those eating vegetarian appear to have less obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, cancers, kidney disease, maybe less stroke, less age-related vision loss, less diverticulosis, fewer gallstone and of course, less constipation. But after going through the laundry list of benefits, the researchers did identify two drawbacks of a plant-based diet: 1) the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, which I’ve covered previously, and 2) increased intestinal gas production. So on one hand, we have half of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, and on the other, flatulence. Let me start off by saying that intestinal gas is normal and healthy. When patients present to physicians complaining of too much gas, they are typically instructed to go home and keep track for a week. “Although this may sound complicated,” wrote researchers in a gastroenterology journal, “we have found that patients rather enjoy keeping such a record.” Americans report passing gas an average of 14 times a day, with the normal range extending up to a frequency of 22 times daily. Many people who think they have too much gas fall well within the normal range, concludes famed flatologist Michael Levitt, M.D., “and they simply have to be informed of their ‘normality.'” Wondering who funded this research? You may be surprised that the real ground-breaking work in this area was done by NASA in the 1950s—our grandparents’ tax dollars hard at work. NASA was genuinely concerned that astronauts might suffocate, or some spark would ignite the methane. So papers with names like “Recent Advances in Flatology” represent space age research! As one NASA research scientist recommended, “it may prove advantageous to select astronauts…who do not normally produce large quantities of flatus.” I’ll never forget the first time I lectured on the subject. I asked if anyone in the auditorium cared to venture a guess as to how many times a day the average person passes gas. I was expecting the students would posit maybe 5 or 10 and then I could wow them with the fact that no, the norm is more like once every waking hour, up to 22 times a day. But the first guess? 200. OK, so maybe some people do have too much gas! For those wanting to cut down on emissions, here are some tips (I’ll try not to be too long-winded :). Flatulence come from two places: swallowed air, and fermentation in the bowel. Things that can cause you to swallow extra air include gum chewing, ill-fitting dentures, sucking on hard candies, drinking through a straw, eating too fast, talking while you eat, and cigarette smoking. So if the fear of lung cancer doesn’t get you to quit smoking, maybe fear of flatulence will. The main source of gas, though, is the normal bacterial fermentation in our colon of undigested sugars. Dairy products are a leading cause of excessive flatulence, due to poor digestion of the milk sugar lactose, though even people who are lactose tolerant may suffer from dairy. One of the most flatulent patients ever reported in the medical literature was effectively cured once dairy products were removed from his diet. The case, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine and submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records, involved a guy who, after consuming dairy, experienced “70 passages in one four-hour period.” Cutting the cheese, indeed. Other poorly digested sugars include sorbitol and xylitol in sugar-free candies. The fizziness in soda is carbon dioxide, which gets absorbed by our gut, but the high fructose in the soda’s corn syrup may be another culprit. Cruciferous vegetables may also contribute (kale-force winds?). Some grains can do it—the word pumpernickel stems from Middle German and means, roughly, “goblin that breaks wind.” Beans have been christened the musical fruit, but could it just be a lot of hot air? A randomized controlled crossover study published last week, “Perceptions of flatulence from bean consumption among adults in 3 feeding studies,” concluded “People’s concerns about excessive flatulence from eating beans may be exaggerated.” Noting that “An increasing body of research and the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans supports the benefits of a plant-based diet, and legumes specifically, in the reduction of chronic disease risks,” they started people on pinto beans, black-eyed peas, or vegetarian baked (navy) beans. During the first week, 35% reported increased flatulence but that fell to 15% by week three, 5% by week five, and 3% by week eight. Much of the bad rap for beans grew out of short-term studies in the 60’s that didn’t account for our body’s ability to adapt. Long-term, most people bulking up on high-fiber foods do not appear to have significantly increased problems with gas. In the beginning, though, “A little bit of extra flatulence,” reads the Harvard Health Letter, “could be an indication that you’re eating the way you should!” The buoyancy of floating stools from trapped gasses can in fact be seen as a sign of adequate fiber intake. The indigestible sugars in beans that make it down to our colon may even function as prebiotics to feed our good bacteria and make for a healthier colon. Even if at first they make us gassy, beans are so health-promoting that we should experiment with ways to keep them in our diet at all costs. Lentils, split peas and canned beans tend to be less gas-producing. Tofu usually isn’t an offender. Repeated soakings of dried beans and tossing the cooking water may help if you boil your own. Worse comes to worst, there are cheap supplements that contain alpha-galactosidase, an enzyme shown to break up the bean sugars and take the sail out of your wind. Odor is a separate issue. The smell appears to come primarily from the digestion of sulfur-rich foods, so to cut down on the stench, experts have recommended cutting back on foods such as meat and eggs (hydrogen sulfide is called “rotten egg gas” for a reason). In “Contribution of Dietary Protein to Sulfide Production in the Large Intestine” researchers found that meat-eaters generated as much as 15 times the sulfides as those eating vegetarian. There are healthy sulfur-rich foods, such as garlic and cauliflower. If you’re about to embark on a long trip in a confined space after a big meal of aloo gobi, Pepto-Bismol® and generic equivalents can act as a windbreaker by binding up the sulfur in your gut to eliminate odors, but should be used only as a short term solution due to the potential for bismuth toxicity with chronic use. Then there are the high tech solutions, such as carbon fiber odor-eating underwear (cost: $65),  which were put to the test in an American Journal of Gastroenterology study that included such gems as “Utilising gas-tight Mylar pantaloons, the ability of a charcoal lined cushion to adsorb sulphur-containing gases instilled at the anus of eight subjects was assessed.” Assessed, that is, by a panel of fart-sniffing judges. And the name of the charcoal lined cushion? The “Toot Trapper.” To reiterate, though, intestinal gas is normal and healthy. No less than Hippocrates himself was quoted as saying “passing gas is necessary to well-being.” As one chair of gastroenterology wrote in a review of degassing drugs and devices (and yes, Dr. Fardy is a real name), “Perhaps increased tolerance of flatus would be a better solution, for we tamper with harmless natural phenomena at our peril.” 	-	beans,bismuth,cauliflower,colon,corn syrup,cruciferous vegetables,dairy,fiber,flatulence,garlic,gas,lactose,Pepto-Bismol,sorbitol,sulfur,xylitol	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/	-	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16183355,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18246621,http://ntrs.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19650056142&qs=N%3D4294882446%26Nn%3D4294963571%7CSubject%2BTerms%7CANIMALS,http://www.ajcn.org/content/19/2/120.long,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=8554251,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3068547,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/beans/,http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr59/nvsr59_04.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17151807,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2199292,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11985415,http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/9/531.full.pdf+html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10998670,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1727181/pdf/v043p00100.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15667499,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=3068547,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?db=pubmed&cmd=search&term=Recent+Advances+in+Flatology,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=7433379,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/947086,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/25/vegan-b12-deficiency-putting-it-into-perspective/,http://www.ajcn.org/content/72/6/1488.full.pdf+html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5238614,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?db=pubmed&cmd=search&term=18128419,http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pumpernickel,http://www.ajcn.org/content/45/6/1457.long,http://www.nutritionj.com/content/pdf/1475-2891-10-128.pdf	
A-470	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/29/alzheimers-disease-up-to-half-of-cases-potentially-preventable-with-lifestyle-changes/	Alzheimer’s Disease: Up to half of cases potentially preventable	November was proclaimed National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month, in recognition of the five million Americans stricken with the devastating terminal illness, now the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. A new analysis suggests that up to half of these millions of cases may have been preventable through lifestyle changes. We’ve known for almost 20 years that compared to long-time vegetarians, those eating meat (including poultry and fish) appear to have three times the risk of developing dementia. Since studies show “even moderately elevated cholesterol increased dementia risk,” the cognitive impairment more often seen in those eating meat may be due to atherosclerotic plaque building in the brain’s blood vessels, which can cause micro-infarctions or “ministrokes” that can kill off little parts of the brain the way clogged coronary arteries can kill off parts of the heart during a heart attack. A new autopsy study found that those with cholesterol levels over 224 had up to 25 times the odds of having Alzheimer’s pathology (neuritic plaques) in their brains compared to those with cholesterol under 224. New evidence presented in a series of NutritionFacts.org videos this week suggests that this may be only part of the puzzle. Maybe it’s not just what vegetarians don’t eat, but what they do; the phytonutrients found in plant-based diets have been shown to have a wide range of beneficial effects. Last Thursday’s video-of-the-day Amyloid and Apple Juice featured new research suggesting there are components in apples and ginger root that may protect human nerve cells (in a test-tube at least) from the neurotoxic Alzheimer’s plaque protein amyloid Beta. It’s one thing to show benefits in a petri dish, though; it’s quite another to show benefit in a human population. That came in Friday’s video-of-the-day The Nutrition Facts Missing from the Label, in which I profile the class of phytonutrients thought to be responsible for cutting Alzheimer’s risk more than 75%. Yesterday’s video-of-the-day, Best Fruit Juice, ranked ten common fruit juices for these phenolic phytonutrients (with surprising results!) and today’s video Constructing a Cognitive Portfolio suggests that different fruits and vegetables support different cognitive domains of the brain, so both quantity and variety of plant foods may be important for the prevention of dementia. What if you or a loved one already has Alzheimer’s? Tomorrow, in Alzheimer’s and Apple Juice I’ll feature a pilot study suggesting apple juice can affect the cognitive performance, day-to-day functioning, mood, and behavior of Alzheimer’s patients. Thursday in Is Pomegranate Juice That Wonderful? I’ll show how food companies (such as POM Wonderful) invoke the First Amendment to defend false and unsubstantiated health claims, and I’ll close out the week with Pink Juice with Green Foam, a recipe for DIY whole food cranberry cocktail with 25 times fewer calories and at least 8 times the phytonutrient content of the retail corn syrup concoction. I think this week does a good job highlighting the three criteria I use to choose among the thousands of articles I sift through annually to create the hundreds of videos I post every year: interesting, groundbreaking, practical.

A-471	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/14/nutrition-education-in-medicine-a-doctor-a-day-keeps-the-apples-away/	Nutrition Education in Medicine: a Doctor a Day Keeps the Apples Away 	This month in the journal Academic Medicine yet another editorial was published decrying the sorry state of nutrition knowledge in medical education, a problem diagnosed yet untreated for the last 50 years. What is the profession doing about it? This morning’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day Medical Associations Oppose Bill to Mandate Nutrition Training exposes the fact that many mainstream medical organizations are actively opposing and lobbying against mandating more nutrition for doctors. This, despite the fact that most medical schools in the United States fail to provide even a bare minimum of nutrition training. Thirty years ago, only about a third of medical schools required a single course on nutrition. That number has since dropped to only 1 in 4, as I showed in Wednesday’s Medical School Nutrition Education. No wonder doctors get failing grades in tests of basic nutrition knowledge about diet and heart disease, our #1 killer. More disturbing, the percentage of medical instructors that think this deficiency is a problem has also dropped over the last decade. In Thursday’s Doctors Know Less Than They Think About Nutrition, I profile a study that suggests arrogant overconfidence may play a role, concluding: “Simply put, doctors say they are knowledgeable but the majority of them are not.” According to a review published last month in Nutrition in Clinical Practice, “virtually every published study about physicians and nutrition counseling showed that primary care physicians…were not delivering nutrition services to their patients.” There was one study of thousands of patient visits to more a hundred family physicians that measured how much nutrition advice they were offering. The average per visit? Less than 10 seconds. 	-	doctors,Dr. John McDougall,medical education,medical profession,medical school,nutrition,nutrition education,physicians	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/medical-profession/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/medical-education/	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/do-doctors-make-the-grade,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9597995,http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/183/11/955.extract,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/medical-school-nutrition-education/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20962310,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22030639,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/doctors-know-less-than-they-think-about-nutrition/

They echo much of what I’ve featured in my three-week video series on the subject. Their first recommendation to reform the process is to “Move primary responsibility for guideline development to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] or IOM [National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine], to avoid conflicts of interest at the USDA arising from its institutional mission to promote commodities.” I explore this twin USDA mandate to both promote agribusiness and protect our nation’s health in my video USDA Conflicts of Interest. I then profile the dietary guidelines of Greece, a country that has taken this recommendation to heart, in It’s All Greek To The USDA.  The success story in Finland, highlighted in From Dairies to Berries, shows that dietary guidelines based on science rather than corporate influence could save millions of lives. Drs. Willet and Ludwig also recommend, “Write guidelines that explicitly state which foods should be consumed less by Americans to reduce risk for chronic disease.” When the federal guidelines issue “eat-more” recommendations, the messaging is clear—for example, “Increase vegetable and fruit intake.” But when it comes to “eat-less” messaging, recommendations resort to speaking in cryptic biochemical components, such as “Reduce intake of solid fats (major sources of saturated and trans fatty acids).” In Dietary guidelines: Just Say No I crack the code to translate what that means in terms of actual foods to avoid. Making the message clearer, explain the two prominent Harvard docs, would have “offended powerful industries.” In Advisory Committee Conflicts of Interest I document how the USDA Dietary Guidelines Committee has been made of up individuals funded by McDonald’s, Coca Cola, the Sugar Association, the American Meat Institute, candy bar companies, and the egg and dairy boards. It is no wonder the dietary guidelines don’t explicitly say to avoid unhealthy foods. In Science Versus Corporate Interests I feature an Arlo and Janis cartoon that I think best sums up the situation. In Dietary guidelines: The First 25 Years I show how the dietary guidelines have gotten progressively weaker even as Americans have gotten sicker. The New Dietary Guidelines for Americans are a definite improvement, though. From the New England Journal commentary: “The guidelines appropriately emphasize eating more vegetables, beans, fruits, whole grains, and nuts and highlight healthful plant-based eating patterns, including vegetarian and vegan diets.” In Plant Protein Preferable a recent review of Dr. Willet’s is showcased, explaining the emphasis on plant rather than animal sources of protein. 	-	agribusiness,American Meat Institute,beans,berries,candy,CDC,Coca Cola,dairy,dietary guidelines,disease,egg,Finland,fruit,Greece,Harvard,McDonald's,nuts,obesity,PCRM,Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,plant-based diet,protein,saturated fat,trans fat,USDA,vegan,vegetables,vegetarian,whole grains	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/industry-influence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dietary-guidelines/	-	http://www.health.harvard.edu/plate/harvard-researchers-launch-healthy-eating-plate,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/new-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/,http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/quick-tips-healthy-eating-plate-pyramid/index.html,http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1107075,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-usda-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-just-say-no/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-the-first-25-years/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-its-all-greek-to-the-usda/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-from-dairies-to-berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-science-versus-corporate-interests/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-conflicts-of-interest/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/plant-protein-preferable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-guidelines-progressing-from-pyramid-to-plate/

A-474	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/03/supreme-court-case-meat-industry-sues-to-keep-downed-animals-in-food-supply/	Supreme Court case: meat industry sues to keep downed animals in food supply 	This week I participated in a press briefing to discuss National Meat Association v. Harris, a case appearing before the Supreme Court next week. The meat industry is trying to overturn a California law meant to keep “downed” animals—those too sick and disabled to walk to slaughter—out of the American food supply. In 2008, an undercover investigation of a dairy cow slaughterplant in California showed that downers were being dragged to slaughter for hamburger meat distributed to the Federal School Lunch Program. The Humane Society of the United States investigators documented workers dragging downed cows with chains, ramming them with forklifts, shocking cows repeatedly in the face and eyes, beating them, and even shooting high-pressure hoses up their nostrils—anything to squeeze every last bit of profit from these animals. The investigation triggered the largest meat recall in U.S. history—143 million pounds of beef—for violations of food safety regulations meant to protect the public from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“mad cow disease”). The investigation prompted California to strengthen its laws to keep downer livestock out of the food supply.  The meat industry—represented by the National Meat Association and the American Meat Institute—responded by suing the State of California to block the enforcement of the law on the grounds that only USDA had the authority to determine which animals are turned into meat. The California Attorney General argued that states should have the right to protect their citizens from the risks and abuses inherent in slaughtering downed animals. In response to the meat industry lawsuit, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enforcement of the downer ban, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision and reinstated the law. So the National Meat Association took it to the Supreme Court. The handling of downers is not just an animal welfare issue. Inability to stand can be a symptom of disease that could threaten public health. Compared to those able to walk, downed cows were found to have 3 times the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7, the strain that kills dozens of Americans a year. The researchers concluded “downer dairy cattle harboring E. coli O157:H7 at slaughter may be an important source of contamination and may contribute to the health risk associated with ground beef.” A single downed cow infected with such a pathogen could theoretically contaminate more than 100,000 hamburgers with an infectious dose. Downer pigs and sheep may also present a food safety risk. Downed pigs have been found to have 16 times the odds of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter infection, the most common cause of bacterial food poisoning in the United States. Allowing downer pigs in the food supply, concluded one team of researchers, “potentially endangers public health.” Even if one doesn’t eat meat, more than half of downer pigs tested in the Midwest were found to be actively infected with swine flu, both the classic swine flu virus and the triple hybrid mutant that led to the 2009 human pandemic that killed more than ten thousand Americans. Other human pathogens linked to downed farm animals include anthrax, Salmonella, and mad cow disease.  At least two-thirds of the 22 mad cows so far discovered in North America have been downer cows. Though the riskiest tissues—the brains, eyes, and spinal cords—of most cattle are now excluded from most food items in the United States, there may be contamination of muscle meat via aerosolization of the spinal cord during carcass splitting. Significant amounts of central nervous system debris found accumulating in the splitting saws used to halve the carcasses may have the potential to then transfer contagion from one carcass to the next. Although, technically, processors are instructed to knife-trim “material grossly identifiable as brain material, spinal cord, or fluid from punctured eyes,” researchers have reported finding nervous tissue contaminating muscle in a commercial slaughter plant. Contamination of meat derived from cattle cheeks with brain tissue can also occur if the cheek meat is not removed before the skull is fragmented or split. Finally, captive bolt stunning, the predominant method used to render farm animals insensible before being bled to death, may blow a shower of embolic brain tissue into the animals’ bloodstream. Texas A&M University researchers found bodily brain fragments as large as 14 cm. The researchers concluded that mad cow pathogens could potentially be “found throughout the bodies of animals stunned for slaughter.” 	-	American Meat Institute,anthrax,campylobacter,cows,dairy,downed animals,downers,e. coli,Federal School Lunch Program,ground beef,hamburger,Humane Society of the United States,livestock,mad cow disease,meat,meat industry,National Meat Association,pigs,public health,salmonella,sheep,swine flu,USDA	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FSISNotices/7-04.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC169068/pdf/0065.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15453582,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15907569,http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/livsci/article/S1871-1413%2807%2900514-8/abstract,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16442628,http://video.humanesociety.org/video/770234195001,http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/1/29.long,http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/284/13/1644.full.pdf+html,http://web.archive.org/web/20071007072913/http://www.meatami.com/Content/PressCenter/IMAWRC/Presentation3STULL.pdf,http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FRPubs/03-038IF.htm,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14725425,http://www.fas.usda.gov/info/fr/2004/071404BSEFDA1.htm,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289987/pdf/phr123000343.pdf,http://www.drgreger.org/BSE.pdf,http://www.wageningenacademic.com/_clientfiles/TOC/welfareofpigs.pdf,http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/topics/BSE_thinking.htm,http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_March_13.htm	
A-475	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/11/01/foie-gras-ban-in-california-human-health-implications/	Foie gras ban in California: human health implications 	Originally featured on One Green Planet. The New York Times recently ran a story on the upcoming foie gras ban in California. July 1, 2012, the Golden State will join over a dozen nations that have prohibited the production of foie gras, the enlarged liver of a duck or goose produced through force-feeding. Arguments against the production practice have focused on animal welfare concerns, but have largely ignored the human health implications. As I detail in my International Journal of Food Safety, Nutrition and Public Health paper, microscopic infectious protein fibers in foie gras may trigger and accelerate a variety of serious human diseases in susceptible individuals via a “mad cow disease”-like mechanism. Amyloidosis is a group of potentially fatal diseases in which accumulated misshapen proteins (amyloid) damage body tissues and disrupt organ function. In their paper “Amyloidogenic Potential of Foie Gras,” published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a collaboration of researchers found amyloid deposits in commercially available foie gras and discovered that they could orally induce amyloidosis in a laboratory setting. The principal investigator concluded: “Perhaps people with a family history of Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or other amyloid-associated diseases should avoid consuming foie gras and other foods that may be contaminated.” What other meat may be contaminated? While ducks under stress deposit amyloid throughout their internal organs, chickens tend to localize amyloid deposits in their joints. The way laying hens are processed, however, means that amyloid deposits found in joints could still end up in certain chicken products. When laying hens are killed at the end of their productive lives, approximately half are slaughtered for human consumption. In the past, “spent” hens were mainly used for soup (Campbell’s™ and Stouffer’s™ were the major buyers), but to reduce the risk of skeletal splinters from the laying hens’ brittle bones, soup manufacturers now tend to use broiler chickens instead. Today’s spent hens are likely to be extruded into“mechanically separated meat,” a substance used in products such as Slim Jims and McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets. It is this homogenization of birds into products such as broths, meat pastes, and flavorings that may result in joint amyloid finding its way into the food supply. The chief investigator of the Proceedings paper is quoted as saying “It is not known if there is an increase of Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes or other amyloid-related disease in people who have eaten foie gras.” Indeed, though undercooked duck liver may harbor the brain parasites toxocara or toxoplasma, foie gras consumption and disease has never been studied on a population scale, nor have there been many studies on dietary risk factors for amyloidoses. A striking contrast has been noted, though, between the rates of amyloidosis triggered by leprosy in the United States compared to India. Whereas historically approximately half of autopsied U.S. leprosy victims have shown evidence of amyloidosis, one study of over a thousand leprosy patients in India found not a single case. The researchers conclude: “Consumption of a mainly vegetarian diet in our population and that of meat in Western population has been suggested to be the probable cause of the difference of amyloidosis observed in the two groups of people.” Based on the leprosy studies blaming animal product consumption, contemporary researchers have suggested “dietary modification [to avoid amyloid containing foods] may be of therapeutic potential in preventing [amyloidosis triggering] amyloid fibril formation.” 	-	Alzheimer's,amyloid,amyloidosis,chicken,diabetes,duck,foie gras,goose,leprosy,liver,mad cow disease,New York Times,poultry,protein,rheumatoid arthritis,soup,toxocara,toxoplasma	-	-	-	-	-	-	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14283377,http://poultryworkshop.com/uploads/PDFs/PSIW%20proceedings%202004.pdf,http://www.ajtmh.org/content/76/3/600.full.pdf+html,http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/in-california-going-all-out-to-bid-adieu-to-foie-gras.html?pagewanted=1,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10427631,http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/hsus-scientists-and-experts-on-force-feeding-for-foie-gras-production-and-duck-and-goose-welfare.pdf,http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/intjfoodsafety2008-1-2.pdf,http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-06/uota-umr061807.php,http://www.onegreenplanet.org/science/foie-gras-ban-in-california-human-health-implications/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15276981,http://www.pnas.org/content/104/26/10998.full.pdf+html	
A-476	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/24/wisconsin-milk-marketing-board-accused-of-making-illegally-deceptive-claims/	Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board accused of making illegally deceptive claims 	A two-part investigation (1 & 2) released last week by the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism revealed that the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board was making claims that may violate state laws prohibiting agricultural marketing boards from false advertising. The Milk Board spends nearly a million dollars a year marketing dairy to Wisconsin school children–for example telling parents “Muscles fueled with chocolate milk are muscles fueled with nutritious energy…” in a state in which more than a quarter of its kids are overweight or obese. In 2003, the dairy industry launched a multimillion dollar campaign to convince Americans that eating dairy products could help with weight loss. In response, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine filed a 2005 petition with the Federal Trade Commission to stop the milk industry from making such false and misleading claims. As a result, national milk boards retracted the claims and ended the ad campaign in 2007. Four years later, though, the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board was still at it, making what experts have called “ridiculously misleading” claims that have been “totally discredited by research not funded by the National Dairy Council.” The only studies to suggest a link between dairy consumption and weight loss were evidently performed by a researcher who received millions of dollars from the National Dairy Council. Today’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day Food Industry Funding Effect profiles an analysis of more than 200 studies to see just how biased industry-sponsored studies are. In their paper “Relationship Between Funding Source and Conclusion Among Nutrition-Related Scientific Articles,” researchers at Children’s Hospital in Boston and the Center for Science in the Public Interest found that studies sponsored by the soda and dairy industries may be even more influenced by funding source than drug studies funded by the pharmaceutical industry. 	-	children,dairy,milk,obesity,Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,salt,sodium,weight loss,Wisconsin	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-corporate-guidance/	http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2011/10/17/wisconsin-milk-board-claims-dairy-aids-weight-loss/,http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6041.pdf,http://www.pcrm.org/pdfs/media/releases/ftc_petition050421.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/food-industry-funding-effect/,http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2011/10/16/wisconsin-milk-board-overstates-dairys-benefits-to-children-some-experts-say/,http://www.nichq.org/pdf/Wisconsin.pdf,http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040005&representation=PDF,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-guidelines-corporate-guidance/,http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/us/11milk.html?ex=1337486400&en=a8693af5905470a6&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink,	
A-477	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/14/heart-disease-there-is-a-cure/	Heart disease: there is a cure	It was proven decades ago that heart disease could be reversed with a plant-based diet. And yet hundreds of thousands of Americans continue to needlessly die. Why the disconnect? That’s the subject of this morning’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day The Tomato Effect. On Tuesday, in Resuscitating Medicare, I celebrated the news that Medicare was finally reimbursing plant-based diet programs for heart disease reversal, and shared a personal story of how my grandmother’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease inspired my own career in lifestyle medicine. On Wednesday, in Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped, I featured Dr. Dean Ornish’s landmark 1990 study proving that heart disease can be reversed without drugs and surgery, and yesterday, China Study on Sudden Cardiac Death explained that there is nothing natural about getting heart disease or dying from it. If a plant-based diet can prevent, stop, and reverse heart disease, why are millions still condemned to die? In The Tomato Effect I feature Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn’s landmark Preventive Cardiology editorial, “Resolving the coronary artery disease epidemic through plant-based nutrition.” Dr. Esselstyn, whose book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease inspired President Clinton’s dietary shift, details the “several mutually reinforcing institutional and commercial interests [that] oppose this lifestyle intervention,” from the billions raked in by the drug companies and stent manufacturers, to agribusiness influence resulting in USDA dietary recommendations “laden with foods that predispose millions of Americans to perish from cardiovascular disease.” Financial interests and influence help explain institutional biases in government and among, say, cardiothoracic surgeons and interventional cardiologists, but why does the medical profession in general appear so resistant to embracing plant-based diets, the proven cure? The “Tomato Effect” describes a slavish devotion to orthodoxy within the medical establishment that has led to a long history of rejecting highly efficacious therapies because they happen to go against the prevailing conventional wisdom. Eventually, the truth wins out, but until then, how many more people have to die? Dr. Esselstyn concludes an editorial he published in the American Journal of Cardiology last year with these words: 	-	Bill Clinton,China Study,Dr. Esselstyn,Dr. Ornish,heart disease,Medicare,plant-based diet,Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease,Tomato Effect,USDA	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resuscitating-medicare/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/resuscitating-medicare/,http://www.heartattackproof.com/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-tomato-effect/	
A-478	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/10/04/inflammation-diet-and-vitamin-s/	Inflammation, Diet, and "Vitamin S"	Last month an update was published on the intriguing suggestion that low levels of salicylic acid—the active component in aspirin—naturally found in plant foods may in part explain the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Some scientists go as far as to suggest those who don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables may be suffering from “salicylic acid deficiency,” a condition with “important public health implications.” Others even propose reclassifying it as an essential micronutrient, “Vitamin S.” Many chronic disease processes involve inflammation, including our top three killers—heart disease, cancer, and stroke—so doctors prescribe a daily aspirin to those for whom the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. About 1 in 10 people on chronic low-dose aspirin develop stomach or intestinal ulcers, which in rare cases can perforate the gut and cause life-threatening bleeding. My video Aspirin Levels in Plant Foods suggests that the low levels of salicylic acid in fruits (particularly nectarines), vegetables (particularly asparagus), and herbs and spices (especially mint, cumin, thyme, and paprika) may provide the best of both worlds. The way aspirin and salicylic acid work is by helping our body keep inflammation in check by reducing the assembly of the enzyme responsible for producing inflammatory compounds from something called arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid that both we and other animals make. In my video-of-the-day yesterday, Chicken, Eggs, and Inflammation, I explain that arachidonic acid is like cholesterol, in that our bodies make all we need for optimal function. The problem is that so do the bodies of birds and mammals, and so when we consume those other animals the level of arachidonic acid in our blood may climb too high. For example, inflammation in our brain caused by dietary arachidonic acid may explain why those eating plant-based diets appear less stressed and depressed (see my video Plant-Based Diet & Mood) and why eliminating chicken, fish, and eggs may improve symptoms of mood disturbance, depression, and anxiety within two weeks (see Thursday’s Improving Mood Through Diet). Arachidonic acid may also play a role in cancer, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders (see Friday’s Inflammatory Remarks about Arachidonic Acid). This morning’s video-of-the-day Chicken’s Fate is Sealed documents the meat industry’s attempts to lower the arachidonic acid level in chicken muscles through genetic manipulation and the egg industry’s attempts to lower arachidonic acid levels in hens by feeding hens blubber from baby harp seal pups clubbed to death in the Canadian seal hunt. But any arachidonic acid from chicken and eggs is in excess of what our body needs. 	-	anxiety,arachidonic acid,aspirin,asthma,autoimmune disorders,Canadian seal hunt,cancer,chicken,cholesterol,cumin,depression,eggs,fish,fruit,heart disease,herbs,inflammation,inflammatory bowel disease,mint,mood disturbance,omega 6,paprika,plant-based diet,rheumatoid arthritis,salicylic acid,seals,spices,stroke,thyme,ulcers,vegetables,Vitamin 'S'	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/	http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14533735,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/improving-mood-through-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/aspirin-levels-in-plant-foods/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/,http://elinks.library.upenn.edu/sfx_local?sid=Entrez:PubMed&id=pmid:11493722,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698873/pdf/1471-230X-9-41.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/,http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsasmi.htm,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/,http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/expert_advice/article1052344.ece,http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2011/FO/C1FO10128E,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16225488

Though only about 1% of visitors leave a question or comment, that still means more than a thousand questions/comments a month. My dreams of answering every one personally were swiftly dashed. I’m having a hard time just keeping up with my new-video-a-day promise! That’s why I need help. I’ll continue to answer as many queries as I possibly can on the site (especially those specific to the data I present), but many are just general nutrition questions that could be answered by most anyone with a nutrition background. So, if you’re a registered dietitian or licensed practitioner with a few hours to spare, I’m in desperate need of your help. Nutrition students and dietetics interns are welcome to contact me, too. Please email me directly at mhg1@cornell.edu. My goal is to make NutritionFacts.org the go-to source for advice about healthy eating. There are already hundreds of videos on more than 1,000 topics, but I’d love to take it to the next level and see this site become a place where people can come and get all their questions answered directly. For those without specific nutrition expertise or training there are still lots of ways to help out—email NutritionFactsInterns@gmail.com to get looped in. Even if you just have a few hours a week, we have a variety of critical site-building and outreach tasks for any experience level.

A-480	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/29/bowel-movements-the-scoop-on-poop/	Bowel movements: the scoop on poop	Years ago we learned that those eating plant-based diets are just “regular” people. In a study comparing omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans profiled in my Bowel Movement Frequency video, researchers found a “very clear trend towards an increasing number of bowel movements with a more rigorous degree of vegetarianism.” For example, even meat-eating women who piled on the fruits and veggies and ate the same amount of fiber had only a quarter the odds of having a daily bowel movement compared to women eating vegan. But does this translate to decreased disease risk?  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of Painter and Burkitt’s landmark paper “Diverticular Disease of the Colon: A Deficiency Disease of Western Civilization” (PDF here). Just as scurvy is a vitamin C deficiency disease, they argued, diverticulosis is a fiber deficiency disease, the result of not eating whole plant foods. No surprise, then, that the majority of older Americans are afflicted with this condition. As I explain in my diverticulosis video, a lifetime of straining to pass stools that aren’t softened and bulked up by fiber can eventually balloon pockets out through the weakest points in the wall of our colons. These bulging outpouchings can get inflamed, infected, and even lead to a life-threatening rupture of our intestines. More than 100,000 Americans are hospitalized every year for this preventable condition. This summer, a team of scientists at Oxford released the results of a study (PDF here) in which 15,000 vegetarians and vegans were followed for nearly a dozen years. Compared to meat eaters, vegetarians had 35% less risk of being hospitalized or dying from diverticulitis, and those eating vegan appeared to eliminate 78% of the risk. What’s most surprising is that even after controlling for fiber intake, those on plant-based diets still had significantly lower risk, leading the researchers to suggest that meat itself may increase the risk of diverticular disease “by altering the metabolism of bacteria in the colon, which could lead to a weakening of the colon wall….” In addition to enhanced regularity, vegetarians and vegans also get points for achieving the preferred stool size and shape. The bigger the better. For example, one reason why women eating vegetarian may have lower breast cancer rates is because they have larger bowel movements, the topic explored in last Friday’s video, Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen. On Monday, Stool Size Matters offered a tip on how to use beets to measure one’s intestinal transit time, and Tuesday’s Food Mass Transit revealed that it may take an average of four days for food to get from one end to the other in women eating a standard American diet, too slow to meet the target half-pound-minimum fecal output for optimal cancer prevention. Yesterday’s Bowels of the Earth contest revealed which country has the largest average stool size (i.e. who’s #1 at number 2), and which population has the smallest (New Yorkers!). 	-	beets,bowel movements,breast cancer,colon,diverticulosis,fiber,meat,omnivores,Painter and Burkitt,stool shape,stool size,vegan,vegetarian	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/toxic-megacolon-superbug/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/colon-health/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139912/pdf/bmj.d4131.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/food-mass-transit/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/stool-size-matters/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/diverticulosis-nuts/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/bowels-of-the-earth/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/bowel-movement-frequency/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21876861,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14972075,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1796198/pdf/brmedj02261-0052.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/bristol-stool-scale/	
A-481	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/26/breast-cancer-and-diet/	Breast Cancer & Diet	October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a concept invented more than 25 years ago by Imperial Chemical Industries with the curious mantra “Early Detection Is Your Best Prevention.” Of course early detection (by definition) doesn’t prevent breast cancer at all; it just attempts to mediate the impact of the cancer once it’s already there. As one of the largest producers of petrochemicals and pesticides in the world, the multi-billion dollar chemical company may not have been particularly interested in getting at the root causes, especially after having subsequently developed the leading breast cancer chemotherapy drug. Breast cancer remains the leading cancer killer of young women in the United States. In recognition of this epidemic, NutritionFacts.org spent last week releasing five new videos highlighting some of the latest research on preventing the disease in the first place. Monday’s video Cancer Prevention & Treatment May Be the Same Thing underscored the fact that since breast tumors can take decades to grow, “early” detection is actually very late, and in some cases too late. Tuesday’s Vegetables vs. Breast Cancer video, though, points to exciting new research that mushroom consumption may be beneficial for prevention, with Wednesday’s Breast Cancer Prevention: Which Mushroom Is Best? comparing the potential anti-cancer activity of a dozen different types leading to a surprising result. Thursday’s Multivitamin Supplements & Breast Cancer highlighted new research suggesting that multivitamin use may significantly increase the risk of breast (and prostate) cancer, while Friday’s video, Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen, offered a natural strategy to reduce one’s risk. NutritionFacts.org has five dozen videos on women’s health, including many others on breast cancer, suggesting that a plant-based diet may be beneficial in preventing, slowing, and treating breast cancer, despite flawed or deceptive studies to the contrary. Diets containing less meat may reduce the risk of breast cancer by lowering one’s exposure to anabolic steroids, heterocyclic amines, and industrial pollutants. Dairy contains hormones that may increase breast cancer risk directly, or indirectly by contributing to premature puberty.  Melatonin suppression by meat and dairy may also play a role. Eating a half an egg a day has been associated with nearly three times the odds of breast cancer. There are also some plant foods, though, that one may want to avoid. Kimchi, acrylamide in crispy carbs, and alcohol may increase one’s risk, and from a breast cancer perspective, folate in beans and greens may be preferable to folic acid in pills. The good news is that numerous vegetables may be protective against breast cancer. The most useful are likely cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli, kale, and cabbage) and allium family vegetables (such as garlic, onions and leeks). Among fruits, organic strawberries appear to preferably block cancer cell growth and, like other berries, may block breast-cell DNA damage. Apples also appear to reduce breast cancer risk. Soy foods have the distinction of both helping prevent breast cancer (in part by supporting normal pubertal development) and improving survival, even for women on Tamoxifen. To further decrease risk of breast cancer, look to daily tea consumption (including a few herbal varieties) flax seeds, black beans, the spice turmeric, and an hour of exercise every day. 	-	acrylamide,alcohol,anabolic steroids,apples,beans,black beans,breast cancer,broccoli,cabbage,cancer,dairy,estrogen,exercise,flax seeds,folic acid,garlic,heterocyclic amines,hormones,industrial pollutants,kale,Kimchi,leeks,meat,melatonin,multivitamins,mushrooms,onions,plant-based diet,prostate,puberty,soy foods,strawberries,Tamoxifen,tea,turmeric,vegetables,women's health	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apples/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leeks/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cabbage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/garlic/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-prevention-which-mushroom-is-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hormones-in-skim-vs-whole-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-folic-acid-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-carcinogens-in-animal-fat-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hot-dogs-leukemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-really-in-hot-dogs-2/	http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/multivitamin-supplements-and-breast-cancer,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/exercise-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/can-folic-acid-be-harmful/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dioxins-in-the-food-supply/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/flawed-study-interpretation-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/repairing-dna-damage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cancer-fighting-berries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hot-dogs-leukemia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/hormones-in-skim-vs-whole-milk/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cancer-prevention-and-treatment-may-be-the-same-thing/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/vegetables-versus-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-really-in-hot-dogs-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/slowing-the-growth-of-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dietary-brain-wave-alteration/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/berries/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/just-the-flax-maam/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/relieving-yourself-of-excess-estrogen,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/melatonin-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/plant-based-prevention/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-survival/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/acne-cancer-connection/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/garlic/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-prevention-which-mushroom-is-best/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/broccoli/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/apples-breast-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/apples/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/womens-health/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/pinto-beans-vs-black-beans-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/anabolic-steroids-in-meat/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/dairy-sexual-precocity/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cabbage/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/red-tea-honeybush-chamomile-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/kale/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/acrylamide-in-french-fries-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/oxalates-in-cinnamon/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/convergence-of-evidence/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/muscle-tremors-diet/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/onions/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-kimchi-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industrial-carcinogens-in-animal-fat-2/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/leeks/	
A-482	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/25/nutritionfacts-org-the-first-month/	NutritionFacts.org: the first month	NutritionFacts.org is the first non-commercial, science-based website to provide daily updates on the latest in nutrition research, presented in short, easy-to-understand video segments. A labor of love brought to life by the Jesse & Julie Rasch Foundation, NutritionFacts.org reached nearly 100,000 people in its first month, thanks in no small part to Kathy Freston’s glowing review on Huffington Post, and favorable mentions from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and Forks Over Knives, the must-see documentary I had the honor of co-hosting at the D.C. premiere. So far, the most popular new videos were Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score, Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods, Pork Tapeworms on the Brain, and Chicken Consumption and the Feminization of Male Genitalia, along with the accompanying blog entry Eating Chicken May Lead to a Smaller Penis. The two other most popular posts were Dr. Oz, Apple Juice, and Arsenic: Chicken May Have 10 Times More and Vegan B12 Deficiency: Putting it into Perspective. Though a new video is added every day, the site launched with hundreds of videos covering more than a thousand topics taken from my annual Latest in Nutrition DVD series (all proceeds to charity). Of the older ones, the #1 Anti-cancer Vegetable video consistently ranks as the most popular (prequel here) followed closely by the Bristol Stool Scale, classifying the fecal form of omnivores versus vegetarians and vegans. Thousands of Vegans Studied made a similar comparative analysis of obesity rates. Videos from my 50-part Harmful, Harmless, or Helpful? series also continue to rank highly, such as Is Vinegar Good For You? Peanut butter? Kombucha tea? So do the ones with practical tips, such as a cheap way to buy goji berries and Cold Steeping Green Tea, highlighting surprising new data on what may be the healthiest way to prepare tea. 	-	antioxidants,apple juice,Bristol Stool Scale,cancer,chicken,Dr. Oz,Forks Over Knives,goji berries,Green tea,Kombucha tea,PCRM,peanut butter,pork,vegetables,vinegar,vitamin B12	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/28/soymilk-shake-it-up/	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-vinegar-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-consumption-and-the-feminization-of-male-genitalia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/	http://raschfoundation.org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/28/soymilk-shake-it-up/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/pork-tapeworms-on-the-brain/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-kombucha-tea-goodfor-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-consumption-and-the-feminization-of-male-genitalia/,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2011/09/15/eating-chicken-may-lead-to-a-smaller-penis/,http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/25/vegan-b12-deficiency-putting-it-into-perspective/,http://nutritionfacts.org/feed/blended/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/veggies-vs-cancer/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/cold-steeping-green-tea/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/2011/09/19/dr-oz-apple-juice-and-arsenic-chicken-may-have-10-times-more/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-vinegar-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/,http://www.forksoverknives.com/,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-freston/nutrition-facts_b_932985.html,http://pcrm.org/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods/,http://www.drgreger.org/DVDs/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/are-goji-berries-good-for-you/,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/bristol-stool-scale/	
A-483	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/16/internships-available-at-nutritionfacts-org/	Internships available at NutritionFacts.org 	Reposted from my Latest in Nutrition e-newsletter (sign up for free here): CNN’s recent documentary “The Last Heart Attack” featured Drs. Ornish and Esselstyn successfully preventing, stopping, and even reversing our number one killer—heart disease—with a plant-based diet. Though billed as the latest cutting-edge treatment, both doctors have been publishing on reversing the heart disease epidemic through diet and lifestyle changes for more than 20 years. Multibillion dollar industries ensure we know about the latest cholesterol-lowering drugs and surgeries, but who’s going to tell us about the latest advances in nutrition?  What else lies buried in medical journals with the potential to save millions of lives that just hasn’t yet seen the light of day? On Monday I celebrate the one-month anniversary of the launch of NutritionFacts.org. Time flies when you’re having fun (or at least when you’re too overwhelmed to even know what day it is! :) Thankfully the site has attracted a dedicated cadre of volunteers and interns to keep the site afloat and I’d love to bring others aboard to join the NutritionFacts.org dream team. So far, our efforts have paid off. In our first month, NutritionFacts.org has drawn 100,000 visitors, exposing more people to my work than probably my entire last decade of speaking. But that’s still less than 0.01% of the world’s Internet users. Tens of millions die every year from chronic diseases, 17 million deaths from cardiovascular disease alone. We’ve got to do better. I need to focus on the science, developing fresh compelling content to keep my promise of delivering a new video featuring new research every day throughout the year. So I am hoping to delegate as many of the site maintenance, building, and outreach tasks as I can. Unfortunately, as a nonprofit, noncommercial site that doesn’t accept advertising we can offer only unpaid internships, but if you can commit to 10 hours a week for at least 10 weeks I would love your help. The hours are flexible; you can work from home. We need everything from data entry and online research to grant writing and food photography. Basically, whatever skills you have (or don’t have just yet!), I want to put to good use. Please email NutritionFactsInterns@gmail.com if you’re interested in helping out. Together, we can reduce a tremendous amount of suffering. If you haven’t already, please get connected and stay in touch so you don’t miss a day: And please help me spread the word by passing these links along. 	-	Esselstyn,heart disease,internship,last heart attack,nutrition,Ornish	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-dean-ornish/	-	http://www.drgreger.org/dates.html,http://www.heartattackproof.com/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dr-dean-ornish/,http://cnn.com/video/?/video/podcasts/gupta/site/2011/08/29/sgmd.last.heart.attack.cnn,http://oi.vresp.com/?fid=b35d0d3558	
A-484	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/15/eating-chicken-may-lead-to-a-smaller-penis/	Eating chicken may lead to a smaller penis 	According to the best available science, three quarters of women find both penis length and girth “somewhat important” or “very important.” What does this have to do with diet? Phthalates. Phthalates are chemical compounds used in a wide range of consumer products, including pesticides, paints, and PVC plastic. The contribution of dietary intake to phthalate exposure, however, was not well defined until a landmark study was published last year in the journal of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Phthalates had been known to affect the genital development of lab rats, but recent human studies have also shown adverse effects on sexual health and development. The most important findings to date have come from the Study for Future Families, a multicenter study of prenatal clinics in California, Minnesota, and Missouri. It was a simple study. Researchers measured the levels of phthalates flowing through the bodies of pregnant women, and then later measured the size and characteristics of their infant sons’ genitalia between ages 2 months to 3 years. There was one phthalate particularly associated with a smaller penis, mono 2-ethylhexyl phthalate, MEHP. The team of researchers conclude: “These changes in male infants, associated with prenatal exposure to some of the same phthalate metabolites that cause similar alterations in male rodents, suggest that commonly used phthalates may undervirilize humans as well….” So what foods should pregnant women stay away from to avoid the “phthalate-related syndrome of incomplete virilization” in their sons? In the study published last year, the urine phthalate levels of thousands of Americans all across the country were measured, along with their diets, to find out which food was most significantly associated with phthalate body burden. They looked at dairy, eggs, fish, fruit, poultry, potatoes, tomatoes, vegetables in general, and red meat. The most statistically significant finding in their analysis was the link between poultry consumption and MEHP. Those that reported on the Study for Future Families data implied that having a small penis size made boys “less masculine” (see video), but the link between masculine behavior and the types of phthalates found in chicken wasn’t established until last year. Researchers found that boys who were exposed did indeed exhibit less male-typical play (such as preferring trucks over dolls). In the video I also show the studies associated the contaminants found in chicken to increased odds of cesarean section, diminished child intelligence, male breast growth, and  attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Maybe the phthalates were just leaching into the meat from the plastic wrap packaging? Probably not, conclude the researchers: “the finding that egg consumption is significantly associated with levels of MEHP too, suggests that chickens themselves may be contaminated with phthalates and that food is not being contaminated just through packaging and processing.” 	-	chicken,eggs,genitalia,phthalates,poultry,pregnancy,sexual health	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-consumption-and-the-feminization-of-male-genitalia/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748073,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920922/pdf/ehp-118-998.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775531/pdf/nihms74898.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280349/pdf/ehp0113-001056.pdf,http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/125/1/e122.full.pdf+html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920903/pdf/ehp-118-1027.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-consumption-and-the-feminization-of-male-genitalia/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16502148,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2727228/pdf/kwp001.pdf	
A-485	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/08/how-much-pus-is-there-in-milk/	How much pus is there in milk? 	In the new NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day, I note that the antiseptics used to disinfect cow teats can provide a source of iodine, but have been found to boost the level of pus in the milk of cows with staph-infected udders. Today’s dairy cows endure annual cycles of artificial insemination, pregnancy and birth, and mechanized milking for 10 out of 12 months (including 7 months of their 9-month pregnancies). This excessive metabolic drain overburdens the cows, who are considered “productive” for only two years and are slaughtered for hamburger when their profitability drops, typically around their fourth birthday, a small fraction of their natural lifespan. Turning dairy cows into milk machines has led to epidemics of so-called “production-related diseases,” such as lameness and mastitis (udder infections), the two leading causes of dairy cow mortality in the United States. We all remember the Humane Society of the United States investigation showing sick and crippled dairy cows being beaten and dragged into the California dairy cow slaughter plant en route to the national school lunch program, triggering the largest meat recall in history. That loss of body condition is a result of the extreme genetic manipulation for unnaturally high milk yields. Because of the mastitis epidemic in the U.S. dairy herd, the dairy industry continues to demand that American milk retain the highest allowable “somatic cell” concentration in the world. Somatic cell count, according to the industry’s own National Mastitis Council, “reflects the levels of infection and resultant inflammation in the mammary gland of dairy cows,” but somatic cells are not synonymous with pus cells, as has sometimes been misleadingly suggested. Somatic just means “body.” Just as normal human breast milk has somatic cells—mostly non-inflammatory white blood cells and epithelial cells sloughed off from the mammary gland ducts—so does milk from healthy cows. The problem is that many of our cows are not healthy. According to the USDA, 1 in 6 dairy cows in the United States suffers from clinical mastitis, which is responsible for 1 in 6 dairy cow deaths on U.S. dairy farms. This level of disease is reflected in the concentration of somatic cells in the American milk supply. Somatic cell counts greater than a million per teaspoon are abnormal and “almost always” caused by mastitis. When a cow is infected, greater than 90% of the somatic cells in her milk are neutrophils, the inflammatory immune cells that form pus. The average somatic cell count in U.S. milk per spoonful is 1,120,000. So how much pus is there in a glass of milk? Not much. A million cells per spoonful sounds like a lot, but pus is really concentrated. According to my calculations* based on USDA data released last month, the average cup of milk in the United States would not be expected to contain more than a single drop of pus. As the dairy industry points out, the accumulation of pus is a natural part of an animal’s defense system. So pus itself isn’t a bad thing, we just may not want to have it in our mouth. And you can taste the difference. A study published in the Journal of Dairy Science found that cheese made from high somatic cell count milk had both texture and flavor defects as well as increased clotting time compared to milk conforming to the much more stringent European standards. The U.S. dairy industry, however, insists that there is no food safety risk. If the udders of our factory-farmed dairy cows are inflamed and infected, industry folks say, it doesn’t matter, because we pasteurize—the pus gets cooked. But just as parents may not want to feed their children fecal matter in meat even if it’s irradiated fecal matter, they might not want to feed their children pasteurized pus. -Michael Greger, M.D. 	-	dairy,dairy cows,hamburger,iodine,lameness,mastitis,pus	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/	-	http://www.uwex.edu/milkquality/PDF/milksecretionandqualitystandards.pdf,http://www.drgreger.org/dates.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11724172,http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2008/5/The-Vegetarian-and-Vegan-Foundation/TF_ADJ_44459.aspx,http://www.nmconline.org/articles/USQuality.htm,http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy07/Dairy07_dr_PartII.pdf,http://nmconline.org/articles/USDA_SCC_2010.htm,http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/meat/interviews/schlosser.html,http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenny-pics/,http://nutritionfacts.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18922193,http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/hsus-the-welfare-of-cows-in-the-dairy-industry.pdf,http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Bos_taurus.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/,http://nmpf.org/latest-news/press-releases/may-2011/proposal-to-reduce-somatic-cells-counts-defeated-by-national-con,http://www.thecattlesite.com/articles/2669/how-big-a-problem-is-dairy-cow-mortality-in-the-us,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18420604,http://animal-health.library4farming.org/Animal-Health-1/DAIRY-AND-BEEF-CATTLE/Bovine-Mastitis.html,http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/12/business/main3613268.shtml,http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news/2008/01/undercover_investigation_013008.html	
A-486	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/06/natural-alzheimers-treatment/	Natural Alzheimer's Treatment 	September is World Alzheimer’s Month, in recognition of those stricken with the devastating disease, now the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. We’ve known for almost 20 years that compared to long-time vegetarians, those eating meat (including poultry and fish) appear to have three times the risk of developing dementia. Since studies show “even moderately elevated cholesterol increased dementia risk,” the cognitive impairment more often seen in those eating meat may be due to atherosclerotic plaque building in the brain’s blood vessels, which can cause micro-infarctions or “ministrokes” that can kill off little parts of the brain the way clogged coronary arteries can kill off parts of the heart during a heart attack. New evidence presented in today’s NutritionFacts.org video-of-the-day suggests that this may be only part of the puzzle. Maybe it’s not just what vegetarians don’t eat, but what they do; the phytonutrients found in plant-based diets have been shown to have a wide range of beneficial effects. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (the so-called “gold standard” of modern medicine), the spice saffron was found to significantly beat out out the control “sugar pill” in helping to prevent further cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients. Saffron has been used as a folk remedy for more than 90 diseases since the Bronze Age over 3,000 years ago. We currently have preliminary science supporting its role for erectile dysfunction, depression, premenstrual syndrome, and now, Alzheimer’s disease. The study used a daily dose of 30mg of saffron a day. According to the World Health Organization, up to 1.5 grams a day may be safe, but 5 grams can be toxic, and 20 grams fatal. Saffron is contraindicated (meaning should not be used) for those with bleeding disorders and for pregnant women (since it may induce uterine contractions). In tomorrow’s video-of-the-day saffron is put to a head-to-head challenge against a leading Alzheimer’s drug. 	-	Alzheimer's,cholesterol,dementia,phytonutrients,saffron,World Health Organization	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alternative-medicine/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/chlorella/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/spirulina/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/dietary-theory-of-alzheimers/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-tofu-cause-dementia/	http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr58/nvsr58_19.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20831681,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8327020,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/saffron-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/phytonutrients/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21438645,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15259204,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/improving-memory-through-diet/,http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/42/9/2672.full.pdf+html,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31010757,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11377113,http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/index/assoc/s14213e/s14213e.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/saffron-versus-aricept/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19427775,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/does-tofu-cause-dementia/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2814023/pdf/dem0028-0075.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18271889	
A-487	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/31/bad-egg/	Bad Egg	In 2008, the Harvard Physician’s Health Study, which followed about about 20,000 physicians for 20 years, found that those eating just a single egg a day or more had significantly higher total mortality risk, meaning eating just one egg a day was significantly associated with living, on average, a shorter life. Later that year, that same single serving of egg was significantly associated with death and hospitalization from heart failure. In 2009, it was diabetes. We’d known how bad eggs were for people with diabetes (doubling their risk of death), but it wasn’t until “Egg Consumption and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in Men and Women”—another Harvard study—that we learned how much eating eggs increases our risk of getting the dreaded disease in the first place. Compared to those eating less than an egg a week, men eating just one a day appear to raise their risk of developing type 2 diabetes 58%, and women, 77% more risk. That’s all old news I’ve covered before (here and here). What’s the latest? Well, whereas the twin Harvard death and diabetes studies followed mostly middle-aged men and women in their early 50s, the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study, published this summer, found that the risk associated with eggs extends well into one’s seventies. And if eggs raise one’s risk of type 2 diabetes so much, what about gestational diabetes, the loss of blood sugar control affecting up to 1 in 10 pregnancies? It was apparently never researched until this year, when a new study found that women eating one egg a day or more doubled their odds. “In conclusion,” the researchers write, “high egg and cholesterol intakes before and during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.” 	-	cholesterol,diabetes,eggs,gestational diabetes,Harvard,heart failure,mortality,Physician's Health Study	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/flax-seeds/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/egg-industry-blind-spot/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whose-health-unaffected-by-eggs/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628696/pdf/295.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/whose-health-unaffected-by-eggs/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21324948,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/avoiding-cholesterol-is-a-no-brainer,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/is-one-egg-a-day-too-much/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20338738,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/egg-cholesterol-in-the-diet,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386667/pdf/nihms44834.pdf	
A-488	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/29/soy-and-breast-cancer-an-update/	Soy & Breast Cancer: an update	We’ve known that regular soy consumption appears to both prevent breast cancer—the number one cancer killer of young women—and prolong survival in women battling the dreaded disease, but we haven’t understood why. Soybeans naturally contain weakly estrogenic compounds called phytoestrogens (derived from phyton, the Greek word for “plant”). So the original theory was that the regular presence of the estrogen look-alikes in our bloodstream might trick our body into ramping down actual estrogen production as part of a negative feedback loop, like a thermostat that shuts off the heat when it senses it’s getting too warm. This theory gained empirical support in 2006 when a group of British researchers showed that indeed the presence of phytoestrogens could effectively down-regulate the enzyme that human cells use to make estrogen (at least in a test tube). The theory fell into disfavor, however, when researchers subsequently failed to show that women who consumed soy ended up with less estrogen circulating in their bloodstream. From a breast cancer standpoint, though, we don’t care how much is in the blood, but how much is in the breast. A new study just published this month measured estrogen levels inside the breasts themselves of women placed on a high versus low soy diet. This was accomplished by aspirating ductal fluid from the nipple, which is what bathes the very cells most likely to turn cancerous. After 6 months, the researchers found a trend towards lower estrogen levels inside the breasts of women eating two servings of soy foods a day. Not only does this aid our understanding of why soy may shield us from cancer, but can help explain the findings presented in today’s new video-of-the-day, which documents new research suggesting young girls drinking soymilk just twice a week may be protected against premature puberty. -Michael Greger, M.D. 	-	breast cancer,estrogen,phytoestrogens,puberty,soy,soy milk,soya milk	-	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-3/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-survival/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16965912,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21742946,http://www.flickr.com/photos/viviannguyen/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-3/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2691652/pdf/dmp010.pdf,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-breast-cancer-survival/	
A-489	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/28/soymilk-shake-it-up/	Soy milk: shake it up!	When I treasure hunt through the medical literature every year, there are three qualities I find myself using most often to sift the year’s nutritional nuggets into video form. Is it groundbreaking? Is it interesting? Is it practical? In this week’s issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, one of the most respected nutrition researchers in the world showed once again a plant-based diet could effectively replace cholesterol-lowering statin drugs like Lipitor. No doubt interesting and useful information, but been there, done that. New studies on aluminum contamination in dairy and scombroid poisoning from canned tuna? Yawn. Covered both back in my volume 3 DVD. Then there are the study results that may be interesting and innovative (dog rose berries have five times more antioxidants than blueberries?), but not practical to put into daily practice (what the heck are dog rose berries?). I’m always on the lookout for papers that have real-world implications, data with the potential to affect life’s day-to-day decisions. That’s the reasoning behind my HHH series, presenting the latest data on whether various foods and substances are bad for you, neither good nor bad, or good for you: Harmful, Harmless, or Helpful? – Acrylamide – Airborne® Supplements – alfalfa sprouts – artificial butter flavor – artificial colors – artificial sweeteners – betel nuts – black pepper – carob – chili peppers – chocolate – citric acid – cocoa powder – coconut oil – cod liver oil – coffee – dates – dragon fruit – fish oil supplements – folic acid supplements – gluten – glyconutrient supplements – goji berries – gum arabic – Herbalife® supplements – hibiscus tea – iron pills – kimchi – kombucha tea – licorice – lutein supplements – lycopene supplements – mangosteen juice – matcha tea – MSG – multivitamin supplements – noni juice – osmanthus tea – Nutrasweet® – peanut butter – plastics – red tea – selenium supplements – sodium benzoate – soy with breast cancer – spirulina supplements – star fruit – stevia – sweet potatoes – tea – tulsi tea – vaseline – vinegar – vitamin C supplements – vitamin D supplements – vitamin E supplements – white potatoes – yerba maté – zinc gel for colds. Today’s new video-of-the-day is in this “hands-on tips for daily living” category. My goal is for NutritionFacts.org to provide not just the latest in nutrition, but the latest in applied nutrition. 	-	aluminum,blueberries,cholesterol,dairy,dog rose berries,Dr. Jenkins,JAMA,Lipitor,scombroid poisoning,soy milk,tuna	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/soy/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/airborne-supplements/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21679842,http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11880572,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21862744,http://www.boston.com/Boston/dailydose/2011/08/best-diet-lower-your-cholesterol/JLm97oxDYPx0KdP2VLQDlO/index.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21535864,http://www.nutritionfacts.org/,http://www.flickr.com/photos/s_y_s/,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/airborne-supplements/,http://www.drgreger.org/DVDs/index.html#dvd2009	
A-490	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/24/how-to-live-longer-in-four-easy-steps/	How to live longer in four easy steps	The CDC published a paper this week in the American Journal of Public Health suggesting that eating healthy, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol intake can add more than a decade to our lives. And the criteria were not very strict. One could meet the “regular exercise” definition by exercising just 3 times a week, and even “never smoked” allowed smoking up to 100 cigarettes. Having a “healthy diet” just meant meeting the outdated and wishy-washy USDA food pyramid guidelines. Still, though, despite the lax definitions, fewer than 5% of Americans achieved all four minimal healthy behaviors. In my video-of-the-day today I detail just how SAD the Standard American Diet is. Previous studies looking at the impact of healthy lifestyles on extending one’s lifespan used different dietary criteria. The ARC study, for example, in their paper “Turning Back the Clock,” just rewarded fruit and vegetable intake (indeed, last week another study was published showing that vegetable consumption may reduce telomere erosion). The Healthy Aging (HALE) study likewise gave points for plant foods but also penalized for meat or dairy, while EPIC measured the levels of vitamin C in people’s blood, a decent proxy for healthy eating since it’s a nutrient found almost exclusively in plants. Today’s video-of-the-day details an elegant healthy eating index based on phytonutrient density. Find out what most people score, and how to turn your own diet into a “perfect 10.” 	-	alcohol,CDC,diet score,exercise,food pyramid,healthy eating index,lifespan,longevity,phytochemicals,phytonutrients,smoking,Standard American Diet,telomeres,vitamin C	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/	http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21857007,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/calculate-your-healthy-eating-score,http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15383513,http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050012,http://nutritionfacts.org/video/alcohol-risks-vs-benefits/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17602933,http://hsus.typepad.com/wayne/2011/06/usda-food-guidelines.html,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21852630,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/research-into-reversing-aging/	
A-491	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/23/can-antioxidant-rich-spices-counteract-the-effects-of-a-high-fat-meal/	Can antioxidant-rich spices counteract the effects of a high-fat meal?	In this month’s Journal of Nutrition, researchers at Penn State report on their experiment in which overweight men were fed a high-fat (chicken) meal with or without a healthy dose of herbs and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and oregano. This was to see what effect they might have on antioxidant status and metabolism. The reason they chose spices is because they’re among the most concentrated sources of antioxidants, as I’ve covered in previous videos (though it probably didn’t hurt that the study was funded by the McCormick® spice company). Not surprisingly, the spice group experienced a doubling of the antioxidant power in their bloodstream compared to those eating an otherwise identical meal without spices. Remarkably, though, the spice group experienced a reduction in postprandial (after a meal) lipidemia (fat levels in the blood)–30% lower triglyceride levels (click here for a larger view). Over time, this could decrease heart disease risk. The researchers conclude with the sentence: “Therefore, the incorporation of spices into the daily diet may help normalize postprandial disturbances in glucose [sugar] and lipid [fat] homeostasis [control] while enhancing antioxidant defense.” Why experience such disturbances in the first place, though? Yes, another new study found, it’s particularly important for those who smoke to eat lots of greens to reduce cancer risk, but it needn’t be one or the other. An antioxidant-rich plant-based diet offers the best of both worlds. To exaggerate the effects of the spices in the study, the researchers instructed the control group to eat a diet especially low in antioxidants. So they could eat all the meat, dairy, and eggs they wanted, white bread and pasta too, as long as it was “not whole grain,” and rice as long as it was “not…brown.” They could have soup, as long as they “avoid[ed] listed veggies.” The only vegetables that were allowed in unlimited quantities were iceberg lettuce and cucumbers. In my new video-of-the-day today, I pit iceberg lettuce against the best animal foods have to offer, with some surprising results. For example, which has more antioxidants: eggs or Coca Cola®? There is a meat that can beat out iceberg lettuce, but even ox livers–the wild blueberry of the animal kingdom–pale in comparison to the antioxidant content of a candy bar. 	-	antioxidants,chicken,cinnamon,cloves,Coca Cola,eggs,ginger,greens,lettuce,oregano,Penn State,plant-based diet,spices,triglycerides	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cloves/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ginger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber/	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/oregano,http://nutritionfacts-cdn-1gv0axns4.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/23155835/SkulasRayetal.jpg,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21092390,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697300,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cloves/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/ginger/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/spices,http://www.flickr.com/photos/sackton/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cinnamon	
A-492	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/08/22/the-last-heart-attack-perfect-timing-for-the-launch/	The Last Heart Attack: Perfect timing for the launch of NutritionFacts.org	Though bumped last night due to developments in Libya, the new CNN documentary The Last Heart Attack features Bill Clinton’s attempts to reverse his heart disease with a plant-based diet. In From omnivore to vegan: The dietary education of Bill Clinton CNN details Dr. Dean Ornish’s tough love but not-so-tough dietary plan. Having “believe it or not, more energy,” the former President describes, “I like the vegetables, the fruits, the beans, the stuff I eat now.” Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr., director of the Cleveland Clinic’s cardiovascular prevention and reversal program is quoted as saying heart disease is a “completely preventable foodborne illness,” arguing that an optimal diet could eliminate our number one killer. What greater testament to the power of eating healthy could there be? This program and others are helping to bring this understanding into the mainstream. The purpose of NutritionFacts.org is to help people take control of their health, to translate the best available new science into practical steps people can take in their day-to-day lives to improve the well-being of themselves and their families. Our first video-of-the-day today documents how plant foods average 64 times more antioxidants than meat, fish, eggs, and dairy–reason enough to transition towards a more plant-based diet. Despite the convergence of evidence, there continues to be resistance within the medical community. CNN’s The ‘heart attack proof’ diet? quotes Michele Simon suggesting that the conventional diets of many physicians may disincline them towards pushing their patients to eat healthier. Indeed there is evidence that smoking physicians are less likely to ask their patients to quit, for example, and doctors who eat more fat are less likely to counsel their patients about the dangers of cholesterol. NPR’s health blog conceded that studies show a plant-based diet can lower the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. “But many of those studies,” dismissed NPR’s Nancy Chute, “though peer-reviewed, were conducted by researchers who are advocates of diets free of animal products.” That’s like the tobacco industry rejecting lung cancer research done by those advocating smoking cessation. Maybe they’re advocates because such diets can… lower the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. 	-	animal products,Caldwell Esselstyn,Dean Ornish,diabetes,heart disease,last heart attack,Michele Simon,Nancy Chute,obesity,plant-based diet,Sanjay Gupta,vegan	-	-	-	-	http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants/	-	http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/08/18/bill.clinton.diet.vegan/index.html,http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldeconomicforum/,http://www.heartattackproof.com/,http://vegan.ellen.warnerbros.com/?adid=menu_ellenslife,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/,http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/antioxidants/,http://nutritionfacts.org/,http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/19/heart-attack-proof-diet-worked-for-me/,http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/02/%E2%80%98dr-sanjay-gupta-reports-the-last-heart-attack%E2%80%99-%E2%80%93-a-mission-possible/,http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/08/19/heart.attack.proof.diet/,http://www.appetiteforprofit.com/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1983933,http://nutritionfacts.org/videos/convergence-of-evidence/,http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/08/20/139782972/bill-clintons-life-as-a-vegan?ps=sh_sthdl,http://www.oprah.com/packages/vegan-starter-kit.html

A-494	http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/04/15/welcome-to-nutritionfacts-org/	Welcome to NutritionFacts.org!	Twenty years ago I changed my diet. It was the year Dr. Dean Ornish published his landmark study showing that our number one killer could be reversed with simple lifestyle changes. Every year since, another 100,000 Americans have dropped dead from heart disease—needlessly. I wanted to help change that. So I went to study at Cornell, home of nutrition pioneer T. Colin Campbell. Then on to study medicine at Tufts, the medical school boasting the most nutrition training in the nation (a measly 22 hours out of hundreds of days of preclinical instruction). Ten years ago, after I completed my postgraduate medical training, I started traveling around the country speaking at community centers, hospitals, and medical schools about the power of healthy eating to prevent, treat, and even cure many of the chronic diseases plaguing the Western world. Five years ago I wrote my first book on nutrition and started a monthly newsletter that morphed into an annual DVD series, in which I review the latest science in the field of nutrition. And now, thanks to the Jesse and Julie Rasch Foundation, I’m able to bring it all online. All the proceeds I have ever received from my books, DVDs, and speaking engagements have always gone to charity and always will. For me, it’s always just been about getting this potentially life-changing, life-saving information into as many people’s hands as possible, and NutritionFacts.org allows me to do that like never before. For years now, I’ve scanned through practically every issue of every (English-language) nutrition journal in the world. More than 5,000 papers are published on human nutrition in the scientific literature every year. Of those, I end up saving, sorting, and scrutinizing at least a thousand of the most groundbreaking, interesting, practical papers and then translate their findings into hundreds of new topical videos every year to document the most recent advances in evidence-based clinical nutrition. 	-	Cornell,Dr. Ornish,nutrition,T.
