	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 21st–28th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 28, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Alpha-lipoic acid supplements may promote weight loss.  Whole-grain rye appears more weight loss friendly than whole-grain wheat.  Capsaicinoid supplements may reduce calorie intake by suppressing appetite.  Beetroot juice may improve exercise performance.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Inflammation  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  The effect of increasing dairy calcium intake of adolescent girls on changes in body fat and weight.   This 12-month, controlled study analyzed the effects of calcium intake on body weight and fat mass in 274 overweight, female adolescents with low calcium intake (less than or equal to 600 mg/day).  It found that increasing calcium intake from dairy products (greater than or equal to 1,200 mg/day) did not significantly affect body weight or fat gain.   Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) as a supplementation for weight loss: results from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.   Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant and organosulfur compound found in almost all food, especially in organ meats, spinach and broccoli. It is also produced in your body, where it plays an important role in energy metabolism.  This review and meta-analysis of 10 controlled studies concluded that ALA supplements may result in slight weight loss of 2.8 lbs (1.3 kg), compared to a placebo.   Negative association between acrylamide exposure and body composition in adults: NHANES, 2003–2004.   Acrylamide is a contaminant classified as “probably carcinogenic” in humans. It forms in starchy foods that are exposed to high heat and is also found in cigarette smoke.  This observational study in 3,623 adults from the US found that high levels of acrylamide in blood were linked to lower body weight and fat mass.   The BROAD study: A randomised controlled trial using a whole food plant-based diet in the community for obesity, ischaemic heart disease or diabetes.   This controlled study in 65 overweight or obese adults from New Zealand showed that following a diet based on whole plant foods for one year led to an 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg) greater weight loss, compared to the control group.   Wholegrain rye, but not wholegrain wheat, lowers body weight and fat mass compared with refined wheat: a 6-week randomized study.   This six-week, controlled study in 70 overweight or obese adults found that when they replaced cereal foods in their diet with whole-grain rye, they lost significantly more body weight and fat mass, compared to refined wheat or whole-grain wheat.  Specifically, they experienced a weight loss of 2.3 lbs (1.1 kg) on the whole-grain rye diet, while those on the refined-wheat diet gained 0.3 lbs (0.2 kg).   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Serum Magnesium Concentrations in the Canadian Population and Associations with Diabetes, Glycemic Regulation, and Insulin Resistance.   This observational study in Canadian adults showed that high magnesium levels were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, better blood sugar control and greater insulin sensitivity.  Foods high in magnesium include nuts, seeds, cocoa, whole-grain cereals and leafy green vegetables.   Inverse Association of Plasma Chromium Levels with Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes: A Case-Control Study.  Chromium is a trace mineral found in small amounts in most foods.  This observational study in Chinese adults showed that high circulating levels of chromium were linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.   Strawberry and cranberry polyphenols improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant, non-diabetic adults: a parallel, double-blind, controlled and randomised clinical trial.  Strawberries and cranberries are rich in polyphenol antioxidants. Polyphenols are found in varying amounts in most whole plant foods and believed to be responsible for many of the health benefits of fruits and vegetables.  This controlled study in 41 insulin-resistant, overweight or obese adults found that taking 333 mg of strawberry and cranberry polyphenols daily for six weeks significantly improved insulin sensitivity, compared to a placebo.   Effects of vitamin C supplementation on glycaemic control: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.   Previous controlled studies have provided conflicting results on the effects of vitamin C on blood sugar control and insulin levels.  This meta-analysis of 22 controlled studies including 937 participants concluded that taking vitamin C supplements for at least 30 days may significantly reduce blood sugar levels in older people and those with type 2 diabetes.   3. Heart Health  Consumption of Fruit or Fiber-Fruit Decreases the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in a Mediterranean Young Cohort.  This observational study in 17,007 young Spanish people found that a high intake of fruits, whole grains or cruciferous vegetables was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.  Those who consumed the most fruit had a 49% lower risk of heart disease, compared to those who ate the least. Whole grains decreased the risk by 57%, and at least one serving of cruciferous vegetables per week reduced the risk by 48%.   Association between Coffee Consumption and Its Polyphenols with Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Population-Based Study.   This observational study in 557 Brazilian adults found that those who consumed 1–3 cups of coffee per day were at a 55–56% reduced risk of high blood pressure, potentially decreasing the risk of heart disease.   Consumption of Yogurt and the Incident Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Nine Cohort Studies.   This review and meta-analysis of nine observational studies with a total of 291,236 participants suggests that eating yogurt generally doesn’t reduce the risk of heart disease.  However, a very high intake, or 200 grams or more per day, was associated with an 8% lower risk, on average.   4. Cancer  Potato Consumption and Risk of Colorectal Cancer in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Cohort.   This observational study in 79,778 Norwegian women aged 41–70 years old found that eating three or more potatoes per day was associated with a 32% higher risk of colorectal cancer, compared to eating 0–7 potatoes per week.   5. Appetite and Eating  Effects of twelve weeks of capsaicinoid supplementation on body composition, appetite and self-reported caloric intake in overweight individuals.   Capsaicinoids are compounds found in hot peppers. These include capsaicin , which is responsible for the burning taste of chili. Previous studies suggest capsaicin intake may reduce appetite.  This six-week, controlled study in 77 healthy adults found that taking either a low-dose (2 mg) or high-dose (4 mg) capsaicinoid supplement daily reduced self-reported calorie intake by 247–257 calories per day, compared to a placebo.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Association of Antioxidant Supplement Use and Dementia in the Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease by Vitamin E and Selenium Trial (PREADViSE).  This controlled study in 7,540 men showed that vitamin E and selenium supplements did not prevent or reduce the risk of dementia.   7. Eyes and Vision  The Association between Vitamin D Deficiency and Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.   Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, is a complication of diabetes characterized by damage to the retina. It may eventually lead to blindness.  This meta-analysis of 15 observational studies with a total of 17,664 participants with type 2 diabetes concluded that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of DR by more than 100%.   8. Liver Health  Docosahexaenoic acid enrichment in NAFLD is associated with improvements in hepatic metabolism and hepatic insulin sensitivity: a pilot study.   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis.  This controlled study in 16 adults with NAFLD showed that taking 4 grams per day of omega-3 supplements (EPA/DHA) for 15–18 months improved liver fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity, promoting reduced liver fat content.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Beetroot Juice Supplementation Improves High-Intensity Intermittent Type Exercise Performance in Trained Soccer Players.   Previous studies indicate that taking nitrate supplements may improve exercise performance. Nitrate is commonly taken in the form of sodium nitrate or as a component of beetroot juice.  This six-day, controlled study in 32 male soccer players showed drinking beetroot juice providing around 800 mg of nitrate per day improved high-intensity exercise performance, compared to drinking nitrate-depleted beetroot juice.   10. Inflammation  Magnitude and Timing of the Postprandial Inflammatory Response to a High-Fat Meal in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review.   Previous studies suggest that single, high-fat meals may temporarily raise the levels of inflammatory markers.  This review concluded that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the only inflammatory marker whose levels consistently increase following a high-fat meal, even in healthy people. The health relevance of these changes is unclear.   11. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Malnutrition is associated with increased mortality in older adults regardless of the cause of death.  Malnutrition develops when people don’t get enough nutrients to sustain good health.  This observational study in 1,767 Swedish adults aged 65 and over showed that malnutrition was linked to an increased risk of premature death, irrespective of the cause.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 14th–21st)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 21, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Blueberries may improve cognition in older people.  Exceeding the daily recommended intake for vitamin D provides no additional benefits for bone health in older people.  Dark chocolate may help red blood cells withstand stress, potentially improving oxygen delivery in the body.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Calorie Expenditure  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Infections and Immune Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  High body mass index is associated with impaired cognitive control.   Impulsitivity, or the lack of inhibitory control, is the tendency to act on a whim without considering the possible consequences. Overly impulsive people are at a greater risk of binge eating and weight gain.  This study in university students found that overweight individuals with a body mass index of 25 or more had less inhibitory control than those who were normal weight.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Lean Fish Consumption Is Associated with Beneficial Changes in the Metabolic Syndrome Components: A 13-Year Follow-Up Study from the Norwegian Tromsø Study.   This observational study in 23,907 Norwegian adults showed that eating lean fish once a week was linked to reduced triglyceride levels and increased HDL cholesterol levels, compared to those who ate lean fish less frequently.  Lean fish consumption was also associated with a reduced waist circumference and lower blood pressure in men. Fatty fish was linked to a higher waist circumference among both genders.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Dairy intake and risk of type 2 diabetes.   This observational study in 63,257 Chinese adults aged 45–74 found that a high intake of dairy products was linked to a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D).  Dairy products appeared to protect against T2D in a dose-dependent manner. Those who consumed the greatest amount of dairy were at a 10% reduced risk, compared to those who consumed the lowest amounts.   Efficacy of fibre additions to flatbread flour mixes for reducing post-meal glucose and insulin responses in healthy Indian subjects.  This controlled study in 56 healthy Indian adults showed that eating flatbread that contained 15% chickpea flour and 3–4% guar gum significantly reduced the rise in blood sugar and insulin levels after a meal, compared to normal flatbread.   Fructose intervention for 12 weeks does not impair glycemic control or incretin hormone responses during oral glucose or mixed meal tests in obese men.   This uncontrolled study in obese men found that drinking beverages containing 75 grams of fructose every day for three months didn’t significantly affect blood sugar control.  However, fructose supplements increased the rise in triglyceride levels after meals. Additionally, the participants gained liver fat and body weight, whereas no changes in belly fat or skin fat were detected.   4. Heart Health  Vitamin C supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease.   This Cochrane review and meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin C supplements reduce the risk of heart disease.  One study in middle-aged and older men suggests vitamin C supplements could be beneficial, but further studies are needed before solid conclusions can be reached.   Dairy consumption, systolic blood pressure, and risk of hypertension: Mendelian randomization study.   This large analysis of observational and controlled studies concluded that dairy intake has no effect on blood pressure. High dairy intake doesn’t appear to be a risk factor for abnormally high blood pressure or hypertension.   5. Cancer  Vitamin B-6 and colorectal cancer risk: a prospective population-based study using 3 distinct plasma markers of vitamin B-6 status.   This prospective observational study in 1,830 Swedish adults showed that vitamin B6 deficiency was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.   6. Calorie Expenditure  Tea catechin and caffeine activate brown adipose tissue and increase cold-induced thermogenic capacity in humans.  Previous studies indicate that drinking tea may increase the amount of calories you burn. Caffeine and antioxidants known as tea catechins (TC) are believed to be responsible.  This crossover study in 15 healthy men showed that TC combined with caffeine may have increased the amount of calories burned in those who had metabolically active brown fat tissue, compared to a placebo or caffeine only.   7. Brain and Mental Health  Prospective association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of depressive symptoms in the French SU.VI.MAX cohort.   The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, olive oil, seafood and fish.  This observational study in 3,523 French people found that a high adherence to the MD at midlife was associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms in men.   Dietary blueberry improves cognition among older adults in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  This controlled study in 37 adults aged 60–75 showed that eating dried blueberries (equivalent to 1 cup of fresh berries) improved certain aspects of cognition, compared to a placebo.  However, blueberries didn’t significantly affect gait or balance.   Mushroom Consumption and Incident Dementia in Elderly Japanese: The Ohsaki Cohort 2006 Study.   This observational study in 13,230 Japanese adults aged 65 and older showed that a high consumption of mushrooms was associated with a reduced risk of dementia.  For instance, those who consumed mushrooms three times per week or more were at a 19% lower risk of dementia, compared to those who consumed mushrooms less than once per week.   8. Digestive Health  Vegetarian diet as a risk factor for symptomatic gallstone disease.   Gallstone disease (GD) is when gallstones are present in the gallbladder or the bile duct. It may be symptomless until it causes a gallstone attack, which is characterized by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  This observational study in 49,652 European adults found that a high body mass index was a strong risk factor for GD. Vegetarians were also at a 22% higher risk, compared to non-vegetarians.   9. Kidney and Urinary Health  Association between Circulating Vitamin D Level and Urolithiasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.   Kidney stone disease (KSD), also known as urolithiasis, is characterized by one or more kidney stones in the urinary tract. It may cause blockage, painful urination, blood in urine and vomiting.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that high circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with an increased risk of KSD.   10. Bone Health  Differences in bone mineral density between normal-weight children and children with overweight and obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.   Bone mineral density (BMD) is a measure of the amount of calcium and other minerals in your bones. A low BMD is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that overweight or obese children have a greater BMD than normal-weight children. Yet, the long-term effects of childhood overweight and obesity on bone health are still unclear.   Impact of Calcium and Two Doses of Vitamin D on Bone Metabolism in the Elderly: A Randomized Controlled Trial.   This 12-month, controlled study in 257 older adults examined the effects of taking daily supplements containing calcium (1,000 mg) and vitamin D3 (3,750 IU or 600 IU).  The study showed that taking 3,750 IU of vitamin D provided no additional benefits for bone health, compared to a dose of 600 IU.   11. Muscles and Physical Performance  Protein Intake and Mobility Limitation in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: the Health ABC Study.   This prospective observational study in older adults aged 70–79 showed that a low protein intake was associated with an increased risk of walking difficulties.  Those who had a daily protein intake less than 0.3 grams per pound of body weight (0.7 g/kg) were at a 86% higher risk of developing walking difficulties, compared to those who had an intake higher than 0.5 grams per pound of body weight (1 g/kg).   12. Blood  Acute dark chocolate ingestion is beneficial for hemodynamics via enhancement of erythrocyte deformability in healthy humans.   Erythrocyte deformability (ED) refers to the red blood cell’s ability to change shape under stress without rupturing. Previous studies suggest that polyphenol antioxidants might help maintain effective ED.  This study showed that dark chocolate improved ED, potentially promoting a more efficient delivery of oxygen throughout the body.   13. Infections and Immune Health  Vitamin-D deficiency predicts infections in young north Indian children: A secondary data analysis.   This observational study in 960 Indian children showed that vitamin D deficiency was associated with a 26% increased risk of acute lung infections, compared to those who had adequate vitamin D levels.   14. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Maternal vitamin D insufficiency and risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.   This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, such as preterm birth.  However, low vitamin D levels were not significantly linked to stillbirth or miscarriage.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 7th–14th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 14, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Taking docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplements may reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.  Drinking nitrate-rich beetroot juice may improve exercise performance.  High intake of sugary beverages is associated with lower brain volume and worse memory performance.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Inflammation    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Mothers intake of sugar-containing beverages during pregnancy and body composition of their children during childhood: the Generation R Study.   This observational study showed that the children of mothers who consumed a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages (SWBs) during pregnancy had a higher body mass index and fat mass, compared to children whose mothers didn‘t drink a lot of SWBs.   2. Heart Health  Intake of Different Types of Fatty Acids in Infancy Is Not Associated with Growth, Adiposity, or Cardiometabolic Health up to 6 Years of Age.   This observational study in 2927 children showed that the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat or polyunsaturated fat at one year of age didn‘t significantly affect growth, fat gain or risk factors for heart disease when replacing carbs.  Similarly, a higher intake of polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat didn‘t affect any health outcomes when replacing saturated fat in the diet.   Adherence to a healthy Nordic food index and risk of myocardial infarction in middle-aged Danes: the diet, cancer and health cohort study.   Myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a heart attack, is when blood flow to the heart, or part of the heart, is disrupted.  This observational study in 57,053 middle-aged, Danish people found that a high adherence to the Nordic diet, measured using the healthy Nordic food index, was linked with a 23% and 45% lower risk of MI among men and women, respectively.   The effect of vitamin D on renin–angiotensin system activation and blood pressure: a randomized control trial.   This controlled study in 84 overweight, vitamin D-deficient individuals with normal blood pressure showed that taking daily vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) supplements for 2 months had no effects on blood pressure.   3. Cancer  The Dietary Inflammatory Index Is Associated with Colorectal Cancer Risk in the Multiethnic Cohort.   The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods are pro-inflammatory, whereas others are anti-inflammatory or neutral.  This observational study in 190,963 adults with various ethnic backgrounds showed that those who followed diets high on the DII were at a 21% greater risk of developing colorectal cancer.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Chocolate consumption and risk of stroke among men and women: A large population-based, prospective cohort study.   This prospective observational study in 84,597 middle-aged and older adults from Japan showed that a high intake of chocolate was associated with a 16% lower risk of stroke among women. The association was not significant among men.   Obese Adolescents Show Reduced Cognitive Processing Speed Compared with Healthy Weight Peers.   This observational study in 162 adolescents found that those who were obese had slower cognitive processing speed (CPS) than those who were normal-weight. CPS can be defined as the time it takes an individual to finish a mental task.  Yet, their executive function – a measure that includes attention, working memory, reasoning and problem solving — remained equal to that of those who were normal-weight.   Association of Serum Manganese Levels with Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis.   Manganese is a heavy metal found in many plant foods, such as whole grains, leafy vegetables, nuts and tea.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that manganese levels tend to be lower in people with Alzheimer‘s disease (AD). The authors concluded that low manganese levels might be a risk factor for AD.   Sugary beverage intake and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease in the community.   This observational study showed that a high intake of sugary beverages was associated with a lower total brain volume and worse performance on memory tests.   5. Kidney and Urinary Health  A Randomized Crossover Trial of Dietary Sodium Restriction in Stage 3-4 CKD.   Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is when the kidneys gradually lose their function.  This crossover study in 58 adults with CKD showed that following a sodium-restricted diet (less than 2 grams per day) for a month resulted in significant improvements in blood pressure and hydration status, compared to a usual diet.   6. Bone Health  Whey Protein Supplementation and Higher Total Protein Intake Do Not Influence Bone Quantity in Overweight and Obese Adults.   This controlled study in overweight and obese adults showed that taking whey protein supplements, 20-60 grams per day during a 9-month exercise program, didn‘t affect bone quality, compared to a placebo.   Tea consumption may decrease the risk of osteoporosis: An updated meta-analysis of observational studies.  This meta-analysis of 14 observational studies, including a total of 138,523 participants, concluded that regularly drinking green tea may improve bone mineral density.  However, it is still not clear whether green tea is associated with a reduced risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Caffeine Ingestion Improves Repeated Freestyle Sprints in Elite Male Swimmers.   This crossover study in 9 elite male swimmers showed that taking 1.35 mg of caffeine per pound of body weight (3 mg/kg) before a freestyle sprint significantly improved their performance.   Curcumin and Piperine Supplementation and Recovery Following Exercise Induced Muscle Damage: A Randomized Controlled Trial.   Curcumin is a polyphenol antioxidant believed to be responsible for most of the health benefits of turmeric. Piperine, a compound found in black pepper, significantly increases its absorption into the bloodstream.  This crossover study showed that supplementing with curcumin and piperine before and after exercise may reduce a few markers of muscle damage.   Protein intake distribution pattern does not affect anabolic response, lean body mass, muscle strength or function over 8 weeks in older adults: a randomized-controlled trial.   This 8-week, controlled study in 14 older adults found that the way protein intake was distributed over meals did not affect muscle growth, strength or physical function.   Influence of dietary nitrate supplementation on physiological and muscle metabolic adaptations to sprint interval training.   Previous studies indicate that taking nitrate supplements may improve exercise performance. Nitrate is commonly taken in the form of sodium nitrate or as a component of beetroot juice.  This controlled study in 36 physically active people showed that drinking nitrate-rich beetroot juice improved exercise performance during 4 weeks of sprint interval training, compared to nitrate-depleted beetroot juice or a placebo.   8. Arthritis  Docosahexaenoic acid in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study with microalgae vs. sunflower oil.   Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the joints. Previous studies suggest that a high intake of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may help in the treatment of RA.  This 10-week, controlled study in 38 adults with RA showed that taking microalgae oil, providing 2.1 grams of DHA per day, reduced the symptoms of RA, including tender and swollen joints, compared to a placebo sunflower oil.   9. Inflammation  Effect of dietary alpha-linolenic acid on blood inflammatory markers: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.   Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid. Some ALA can be changed into long-chain, anti-inflammatory fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but this conversion is inefficient.  This meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that taking ALA supplements does not reduce inflammatory markers. It might even increase the levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) in healthy people.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 31st–April 7th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 7, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Impulsivity is linked to a higher risk of obesity, especially among men.  Butter raises LDL cholesterol levels, compared to cheese, but only in those who are high in LDL cholesterol to begin with.  Eating eggs may improve blood lipid levels.  Multi-strain probiotic supplements may benefit liver health in children with fatty liver.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Liver Health  Inflammation  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Pregnancy and Infant Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Association between Impulsivity and Weight Status in a General Population.   Impulsivity is the tendency to act on a whim without considering the possible consequences. Previous studies show that overly impulsive people are at a greater risk of binge eating.  This observational study in adults found that high impulsivity was significantly linked to a higher risk of obesity. The association was stronger in men than women.   Sleep characteristics modify the association of genetic predisposition with obesity and anthropometric measurements in 119,679 UK Biobank participants.   This observational study in 119,859 European adults showed that poor sleeping habits — short, interrupted or irregular sleep — strengthened the association between obesity and genetic risk factors for obesity.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Long-Term Vitamin D Supplementation Affects Metabolic Status in Vitamin D-Deficient Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.   This controlled study in 60 diabetics with vitamin D deficiency showed that taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D supplements every two weeks for six months reduced fasting blood sugar and insulin levels, as well as insulin sensitivity, compared to a placebo.  Vitamin D supplements also reduced markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and increased levels of glutathione, one of the body’s main antioxidants.   3. Heart Health  Coffee, tea, caffeine, and risk of hypertension: The Singapore Chinese Health Study.   This observational study in 63,257 Chinese people aged 45–74 showed those who drank 1 cup of coffee daily were at an increased risk of high blood pressure, compared to those who drank less than 1 cup per week or 3 or more cups daily.   Comparison of the impact of SFAs from cheese and butter on cardiometabolic risk factors: a randomized controlled trial.   This crossover study in adults with abdominal obesity compared the effects of five, four-month, calorie-matched diets providing different types and amounts of fat.  One of its most interesting findings was that eating high amounts of butter increased LDL cholesterol levels, compared to eating cheese, but only in those who had high LDL cholesterol levels to begin with.   Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the risk of cardiovascular disease: dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies.   This meta-analysis of 32 observational studies concluded that high circulating vitamin D levels were associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and death from heart-related problems.   Intake of up to 3 Eggs per Day Is Associated with Changes in HDL Function and Increased Plasma Antioxidants in Healthy, Young Adults.   This 14-week crossover study in 38 healthy adults showed that eating 1–3 eggs per day improved the blood lipid profile, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease, compared to eating no eggs.  Eating eggs also caused a 20–31% increase in the levels of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are carotenoid antioxidants associated with improved eye health.   4. Cancer  Early Life Residence, Fish Consumption, and Risk of Breast Cancer.   This observational study in 2,882 Icelandic women showed that a very high intake of fish in early to midlife was linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer.  Eating more than four servings of fish per week during adolescence was associated with a 29% lower risk, compared to those who only consumed two servings per week or less. In midlife, eating more than four servings was linked to a 54% lower risk.   Dietary inflammatory index and risk of renal cancer in the Iowa Women’s Health Study.   The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods may be proinflammatory, whereas others may be anti-inflammatory or neutral.  This observational study followed 33,817 women for 25 years. It found that women who adhered to a diet high on the DII were at an increased risk of kidney cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Comparable effects of breakfast meals varying in protein source on appetite and subsequent energy intake in healthy males.   This controlled study in 28 men compared the effects of eating different types of protein on appetite and calorie intake. Meals consisted of rice pudding with 25% of either animal-sourced protein, plant protein or an equal mixture of both.  The study found no significant differences in subsequent appetite ratings between the meals. There were also no differences in calorie intake at a subsequent buffet or in self-rated calorie intake for the rest of the day.   No influence of carbonation on glycemic response, gastric emptying and satiety of sweetened drinks.   This controlled study in 15 healthy adults showed that drinking a carbonated, sugar-sweetened beverage didn’t affect blood sugar control, stomach emptying or fullness, compared to a non-carbonated, sugar-sweetened beverage.   6. Brain and Mental Health  ω-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation Does Not Affect Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.   This meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that omega-3 supplements do not affect autism in children. However, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made.   7. Digestive Health  Effect of Probiotics on Diarrhea in Children With Severe Acute Malnutrition: A Randomized Controlled Study in Uganda.   This controlled study in severely malnourished Ugandan children showed that probiotic supplements reduced the number of days they suffered from diarrhea by 26%.  However, the supplements had no effects on diarrhea during hospitalization. Also, they did not affect diarrhea incidence or severity.   8. Liver Health  Effects of Probiotics on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Obese Children and Adolescents.   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis.  This controlled study in 64 obese children with NAFLD showed that taking a multi-strain probiotic supplement for three months improved several markers of liver health.   Good Adherence to Mediterranean Diet reduces the risk to develop NASH and diabetes in pediatric patients with obesity: the results of an Italian Study.   The Mediterranean diet is a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, olive oil, seafood and fish. Previous studies have linked it to a reduced risk of many chronic diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  This observational study in obese children and adolescents showed that low adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was more common in those who had NAFLD.   9. Inflammation  Vegetable and Fruit Intakes Are Associated with hs-CRP Levels in Pre-Pubertal Girls.   Chronic inflammation is associated with many lifestyle diseases. Levels of certain compounds in the blood are used to estimate inflammation. They are known as inflammatory markers and include high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).  This observational study found that a high intake of saturated fat and low intakes of fiber, vitamin E, fruits and vegetables were associated with high circulating levels of hs-CRP in girls, but not in boys.   The effect of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) on serum inflammatory markers: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.   DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It is a popular diet that was designed to reduce blood pressure. However, it may also benefit health in other ways.  This meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that adhering to the DASH diet is an effective way to reduce levels of inflammatory markers, compared to a usual diet.   10. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Effects of cranberry (Vaccinum macrocarpon) supplementation on iron status and inflammatory markers in rowers.   This controlled study in 16 Polish rowers found that taking 1,200 mg of a cranberry extract supplement per day for six weeks improved antioxidant status, but it didn’t significantly affect inflammatory markers or measures of iron metabolism.   11. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Meal frequency patterns and glycemic properties of maternal diet in relation to preterm delivery: Results from a large prospective cohort study.   This observational study in 66,000 Norwegian women found that regularly consuming main meals — breakfast, lunch and dinner — was associated with a reduced risk of preterm delivery.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 24th–31st)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 31, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Supplementing with genistein, a soy isoflavone, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  Probiotic supplements may improve quality of life in people with seasonal allergies and rhinitis.  Children that were breastfed for 6 months or longer were at a reduced risk of lung infections after infancy and up to 4 years of age.  Probiotic supplementation among infants improved immune system function in body fluids.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Lung Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Infections and Immune Health    1. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Resistant starch lowers postprandial glucose and leptin in overweight adults consuming a moderate-to-high-fat diet: a randomized-controlled trial.  Resistant starch (RS) is a type of dietary fiber found in whole grains and other starch-rich foods. Previous studies show that RS may improve blood sugar control.  This study in 18 overweight but healthy adults showed that eating 30 grams of RS daily for six weeks improved blood sugar control. However, these changes weren’t significantly different from the control group.   2. Heart Health  The Effects of Moderate Whole Grain Consumption on Fasting Glucose and Lipids, Gastrointestinal Symptoms, and Microbiota.   This controlled study in people who didn’t habitually eat whole grains compared the health effects of a six-week diet high in either whole or refined grains.  The whole-grain diet (WGD) led to a significant decrease in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, but no such changes were seen on the refined-grain diet. The WGD also caused an increased bowel movement frequency.   Randomized clinical trial in vitamin D-deficient adults comparing replenishment with oral vitamin D3 with narrow-band UV type B light: effects on cholesterol and the transcriptional profiles of skin and blood.   Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a poor blood lipid profile, which is linked to an increased risk of heart disease. However, previous studies show that vitamin D supplementation does not improve blood lipid levels.  This controlled study in vitamin D-deficient adults confirmed previous studies showing that neither vitamin D3 supplementation nor exposure to ultraviolet light improved blood lipid levels.   Probiotic supplementation for management of cardiovascular risk factors in adults with type II diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.   Probiotics are live bacteria that have health benefits when consumed. They are found in certain fermented foods, such as probiotic yogurt, and also available as supplements.  This review of 11 controlled studies concluded that supplementing with probiotics may help improve a poor blood lipid profile (dyslipidemia) and reduce high blood pressure (hypertension) in patients with type 2 diabetes.   3. Appetite and Eating  Prebiotic supplementation improves appetite control in children with overweight and obesity: a randomized controlled trial.   Prebiotics are dietary substances, such as fiber and non-digestible carbs, that feed the beneficial bacteria in the colon. Studies indicate that supplementing with prebiotics may help prevent obesity and chronic disease.  This controlled study in obese children showed that prebiotic supplementation resulted in reduced calorie intake at a breakfast buffet among 11–12 year olds, but not in 7–10 year olds. However, prebiotics didn’t result in weight loss.   Brain response to taste in overweight children: A pilot feasibility study.   This observational study found greater brain responses to the taste of a chocolate milkshake in overweight children, compared to normal-weight children.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Probiotics for people with hepatic encephalopathy.   Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a brain disorder characterized by confusion, changes in consciousness and coma. It is caused by the accumulation of toxic substances in the blood because of liver failure.  This meta-analysis concluded that probiotic supplements may possibly slow the development of HE and improve quality of life. However, they do not reduce the risk of death.   A four-day Western-style dietary intervention causes reductions in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and interoceptive sensitivity.   This controlled study showed that eating a breakfast high in saturated fat and added sugar for four days in a row impaired learning and memory and reduced sensitivity to hunger and fullness signals, compared to a healthier breakfast.   5. Digestive Health  The role of gluten consumption at an early age in celiac disease development: a further analysis of the prospective PreventCD cohort study.   Some researchers suggest that a high intake of gluten early in life may increase the risk of celiac disease or gluten intolerance later in life.  However, this observational study showed that gluten intake at 11–36 months of age was not associated with the development of celiac disease in children at a high genetic risk of it.   Maternal Prebiotic Ingestion Increased the Number of Fecal Bifidobacteria in Pregnant Women but Not in Their Neonates Aged One Month.   A class of prebiotic fiber called fructooligosaccharides (FOS) can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria in the colon. This controlled study in pregnant women investigated the effects of FOS supplements.  The study found that taking 8 grams of FOS per day from the 26th week of pregnancy until one month after delivery increased the number of bifidobacteria in stool, as well as stool frequency. No changes were detected in the children.   6. Lung Health  Fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of COPD: a prospective cohort study of men.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterized by impaired airflow in the lungs. The main symptoms are coughs and shortness of breath.  This observational study in 44,335 Swedish men found that a high intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a reduced risk of COPD in current and previous smokers, but not in those who had never smoked.   7. Bone Health  Building better bones in childhood: a randomized controlled study to test the efficacy of a dietary intervention program to increase calcium intake.   This controlled study in 139 children between 7–10 years old found that a higher calcium intake, or up to 1,500 mg per day, did not result in improved bone mineral density or content over a three-year period.  The study also showed that a high calcium intake was associated with a reduced risk of fat gain.   Antiosteoporotic Activity of Genistein Aglycone in Postmenopausal Women: Evidence from a Post-Hoc Analysis of a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.   Soybeans and soy products are rich in antioxidant isoflavones, such as genistein.  This controlled study in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density and osteoporosis showed that taking 54 mg of genistein every day for two years significantly reduced the incidence of osteoporosis.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Body-composition changes in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE)-2 study: a 2-y randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in nonobese humans.   This controlled study in 218 non-obese adults found that two years of a 12% calorie restriction significantly reduced body weight, waist circumference and lean mass, compared to the control group. Men lost more lean mass than women.  The study also showed that activity-related calorie expenditure was associated with greater preservation of lean mass. In contrast, protein intake was not significantly linked to lean mass preservation.   9. Arthritis  Monounsaturated fatty acids might be key factors in the Mediterranean diet that suppress rheumatoid arthritis disease activity: the TOMORROW study.   The Mediterranean diet (MD) is associated with numerous health benefits. For instance, it may reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the joints.  This observational study suggests that the MD may benefit patients with RA because of its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are abundant in olive oil.   10. Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Probiotics (Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, and Bifidobacterium longum MM-2) improve rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life in individuals with seasonal allergies: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.   Rhinoconjunctivitis or rhinitis is a condition characterized by runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing and itchy, red eyes. It is usually associated with allergies.  This study showed that taking probiotic supplements containing Lactobacillus gasseri , Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum improved the quality of life for people with self-reported seasonal allergies and rhinitis.   11. Infections and Immune Health  Breastfeeding and the risk of respiratory tract infections after infancy: The Generation R Study.   This observational study in 5,322 children showed that those who were breastfed for six months or longer were at a reduced risk of lung infections after infancy and up to four years of age.   Bifidobacterium bifidum OLB6378 Simultaneously Enhances Systemic and Mucosal Humoral Immunity in Low Birth Weight Infants: A Non-Randomized Study.   This controlled study in infants with a low birth weight investigated the effects of taking probiotic supplements containing Bifidobacterium bifidum from birth to six months of age.  The study showed that the probiotics improved immune system function in body fluids, potentially increasing the infants’ ability to fight infections. Dead probiotics also led to marked benefits, compared to a placebo.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 17th–24th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 24, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Blueberry antioxidants may temporarily improve mood in children and adults.  Vitamin D supplements may reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections.  People on a gluten-free diet tend to have higher blood levels of toxic heavy metals.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Infections and Immune Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Contaminants and Food Safety    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Associations between Yogurt Consumption and Weight Gain and Risk of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome: A Systematic Review.   This review concluded that yogurt consumption is generally associated with reduced waist circumference, lower weight gain and a decreased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome.  However, the evidence is not entirely consistent overall and some studies found no significant links.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Orange Pomace Improves Postprandial Glycemic Responses: An Acute, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Crossover Trial in Overweight Men.   Orange pomace (OP) is a fiber-rich byproduct of orange juice production.  This crossover study in 34 overweight men showed that consuming an OP beverage during a high-carb breakfast reduced the rise in blood sugar, compared to a placebo.   Total and subtypes of dietary fat intake and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED) study.   This observational study found that those who consumed the most animal fat or saturated fat were at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, compared to those with the lowest intakes.  Additionally, when the researchers looked at certain fat sources specifically, they discovered that a high intake of cheese and butter were linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, full-fat yogurt was linked to a reduced risk.   Effect of macronutrients and fiber on postprandial glycemic responses and meal glycemic index and glycemic load value determinations.   This study in middle-aged and elderly women showed that adding protein to a high-carb meal consisting of white bread reduced the subsequent rise in blood sugar.  In contrast, adding fat or oat fiber to the meal didn’t significantly affect blood sugar levels.   Chronic Consumption of Artificial Sweetener in Packets or Tablets and Type 2 Diabetes Risk: Evidence from the E3N-European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Study.   This observational study in 61,440 women found that frequent intake of artificial sweeteners was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.   Soft drink consumption and gestational diabetes risk in the SUN Project.   Gestational diabetes (GD) is when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes become resistant to the effects of insulin. As in other types of diabetes, GD leads to excessively high blood sugar levels.  This observational study found that when women consumed a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages before pregnancy, they were at a higher risk of GD. In contrast, diet soft drinks (without added sugar) weren’t linked to GD.   3. Heart Health  Significant inverse association of equol-producer status with coronary artery calcification but not dietary isoflavones in healthy Japanese men.  Soy is rich in isoflavones like daidzein . In the colon, daidzein is changed into equol by intestinal bacteria. However, this only happens in so-called equol producers, or individuals who have certain gut bacteria.  This observational study in Japanese men found that equol producers had a lower risk of calcification in heart blood vessels, compared to non-equol producers.   4. Cancer  Vegetarianism and colorectal cancer risk in a low-selenium environment: effect modification by selenium status? A possible factor contributing to the null results in British vegetarians.  Previous observational studies show that those who follow a vegetarian diet are at a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. However, studies in British vegetarians have found no significant links.  This observational study showed that British vegetarians are low in selenium, a finding that may explain why British vegetarians aren’t at a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, compared to meat eaters.   Glycaemic index, glycaemic load and risk of cutaneous melanoma in a population-based, case-control study.  This observational study found that eating large amounts of foods that contain easily digested carbs, such as refined carbs, sugar and candy, was associated with an increased risk of melanoma skin cancer.  This association was significant among women, but not men.   The Effect of Green Tea Consumption on Prostate Cancer Risk and Progression: A Systematic Review.   This review concluded that regularly drinking green tea may reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but controlled studies need to confirm its benefits.  In contrast, there is limited evidence on green tea’s effectiveness at treating prostate cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Associations between children’s diet quality and watching television during meal or snack consumption: A systematic review.   This review of observational studies concluded that children who often eat while watching television have a higher intake of junk food, such as pizzas, fried snacks, candy and sugary soda, compared to those who don’t.  A few studies linked this dietary pattern with a lower socioeconomic status.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Vitamin D is not associated with incident dementia or cognitive impairment: an 18-y follow-up study in community-living old men.   This prospective observational study in 1,182 older Swedish men found that vitamin D status was not significantly associated with the risk of developing dementia or cognitive impairment during the following 18 years.   Effects of Acute Blueberry Flavonoids on Mood in Children and Young Adults.   Blueberries are exceptionally rich in flavonoids , which are a group of antioxidants found in virtually all plant-sourced foods.  This controlled study in young adults and children showed that drinking a flavonoid-rich blueberry beverage improved mood and promoted positive thoughts two hours afterwards, compared to a placebo.   7. Digestive Health  Role of Fiber in Symptomatic Uncomplicated Diverticular Disease: A Systematic Review.   Diverticulitis is when pouches lining the colon wall become inflamed. The main symptoms include stomach pain, nausea, fever, bloating, gas and lack of appetite.  This review concluded that dietary or supplemental fiber might benefit people with diverticulitis. However, more high-quality studies are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.   8. Infections and Immune Health  Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data.  This meta-analysis of 25 controlled studies concluded that vitamin D supplements may reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections by 12%.   9. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Fructose in Breast Milk Is Positively Associated with Infant Body Composition at 6 Months of Age.   This observational study showed that high levels of fructose in breast milk were linked to higher fat mass, lean mass and bone mineral density in breastfed infants at six months of age.  Other sugars in milk — glucose and lactose — were not significantly associated with measures of body composition.   10. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Vitamin D and mortality: Individual participant data meta-analysis of standardized 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 26916 individuals from a European consortium.   This observational study in 26,916 Europeans showed that low levels of vitamin D were associated with an increased risk of death from any cause.   11. Contaminants and Food Safety  Accumulation of Heavy Metals in People on a Gluten-Free Diet.   Seafood and rice may have high levels of metals, such as mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt. Some people on a gluten-free diet eat a lot of rice-based products like rice biscuits.  This observational study showed that people on a gluten-free diet had higher blood levels of mercury, lead and cadmium, compared to people on a normal diet. They also had higher levels of arsenic in their urine.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 10th–17th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 17, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   A high-fat, high-calorie diet may raise blood sugar and insulin levels.  Attention and memory may temporarily decline after a lunch meal, but almonds can partly prevent the dip.  Taking probiotics with antibiotics reduces the risk of gut inflammation and diarrhea.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Sleep    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Dietary intake of whole grains and plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations in relation to changes in anthropometry: the Danish diet, cancer and health cohort study.  This observational study in 57,053 Danish people found no strong association between whole grain intake and body weight or waist circumference.  However, when the researchers looked at levels of alkylresorcinols (AR), which are a marker of whole grain intake, they found that high levels were linked to lower waist circumference (but not body weight) in women only.   Prospective association between consumption frequency of organic food and body weight change, risk of overweight or obesity: results from the NutriNet-Santé Study.  This observational study in 62,224 adults showed that eating organic food was associated with a reduced risk of weight gain and obesity. Those who ate organic food also had better dietary quality overall, explaining the association.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Soft drink consumption is associated with increased incidence of the metabolic syndrome only in women.  Metabolic syndrome is a group of adverse conditions associated with excessive belly fat. It includes high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar levels and high triglyceride levels.  This prospective observational study in 5,797 Korean adults found that a high intake of soft drinks was linked to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women, but not in men.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Glycemic, insulinemic and incretin responses after oral trehalose ingestion in healthy subjects.  Trehalose is a type of sugar made of two, connected glucose molecules. In the gut, digestive enzymes quickly break trehalose into glucose, which raises blood sugar levels.  This crossover study in 20 healthy people investigated the effects of eating 25 grams of trehalose while fasting. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that trehalose didn’t raise blood sugar levels as rapidly as 25 grams of glucose.   Influence of temperate, subtropical, and tropical fruit consumption on risk of type 2 diabetes in an Asian population.  This observational study in Asian people showed that a high intake of temperate fruits, such as apples, was linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among women.  However, not all fruits were linked to a lower risk of T2D. Also, the study found that a high intake of fruits rich in easily digested carbs like bananas was linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in men.   Short-term, high-fat overfeeding impairs glycaemic control but does not alter gut hormone responses to a mixed meal tolerance test in healthy, normal-weight individuals.  This study in nine healthy adults investigated the effects of eating a high-fat (65% of total calories), high-calorie (50% additional calories) diet for a week.  The diet increased blood sugar levels by 11.6% after meals and insulin by 25.9%. However, the appetite hormones ghrelin , glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were unaffected.   4. Heart Health  Effects of an Encapsulated Fruit and Vegetable Juice Concentrate on Obesity-Induced Systemic Inflammation: A Randomised Controlled Trial.   This study in 56 overweight adults showed taking six capsules of a fruit and vegetable concentrate for eight weeks reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, TNF-α (an inflammatory marker) and total lean mass, whereas placebo capsules had no effects.   Impact of Flavonols on Cardiometabolic Biomarkers: A Meta‐Analysis of Randomized Controlled Human Trials to Explore the Role of Inter‐Individual Variability.  Flavonols are a group of antioxidants found in various plant-sourced foods.  This meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that a high intake of flavonols reduced blood sugar levels, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, especially in Asian people and those with heart disease or a poor blood lipid profile.   Effects of a very high saturated fat diet on LDL particles in adults with atherogenic dyslipidemia: A randomized controlled trial.  Previous studies show that replacing carbs or unsaturated fats with saturated fats results in an increase in large LDL particles, while it has little effect on small, dense LDL particles. The smaller particles are more strongly linked to heart disease.  However, not everyone responds to saturated fat similarly. This controlled study suggests a very high intake of saturated fat may raise the levels of small, dense LDL in genetically predisposed individuals suffering from atherogenic dyslipidemia .   5. Brain and Mental Health  Effects of almond consumption on the post-lunch dip and long-term cognitive function in energy-restricted overweight and obese adults.  People frequently experience reduced alertness and memory after eating lunch. The effect seems to depend on the types of food eaten.  This controlled study in overweight and obese adults confirmed previous findings. However, eating an almond-enriched, high-fat lunch reduced the memory decline by 57.7%, compared to a high-carb lunch.   Vitamin D deficiency is significantly associated with depression in patients with chronic kidney disease.  This observational study in Koreans with chronic kidney disease showed that low levels of vitamin D were associated with an increased risk of depression.   6. Digestive Health  Substituting whole grains for refined grains in a 6-wk randomized trial has a modest effect on gut microbiota and immune and inflammatory markers of healthy adults.  This controlled study in 81 adults aged 40–65 years old showed that following a diet high in whole grains for six weeks increased stool weight and frequency, compared to a diet consisting of refined grains.  The whole grain diet also modestly increased numbers of beneficial gut bacteria, while reducing numbers of bacteria associated with inflammation.   Timely use of Probiotics in Hospitalized Adults Prevents Clostridium difficile Infection: a Systematic Review with Meta-Regression Analysis.  Clostridium difficile (CD) is a bacteria found in the gut of many people. It may cause diarrhea and inflammation, especially in patients on antibiotics. Antibiotics may kill beneficial bacteria that normally keep CD under control.  This meta-analysis of controlled studies in hospitalized adults concluded that taking probiotic supplements close to the first antibiotic dose may reduce the risk of a CD infection by more than a half.   7. Kidney and Urinary Health  Healthy Dietary Patterns and Risk of Mortality and ESRD in CKD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies in people with kidney disease concluded that an increased intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, whole grains and fiber is associated with a reduced risk of death.  In contrast, a higher intake of red meat, sodium and refined sugar was linked to an increased risk of death.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Dietary protein is associated with musculoskeletal health independently of dietary pattern: the Framingham Third Generation Study.  This observational study showed that people who ate the least protein had less muscle mass (lean mass) and strength, independently of dietary pattern or protein source.   Effect of low dose, short-term creatine supplementation on muscle power output in elite youth soccer players.  This controlled study in elite soccer players showed that taking low-dose creatine supplements for two weeks improved muscle power, compared to a placebo.  Power is similar to strength, but it also takes speed or “explosive force” into consideration.   9. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Açai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) dietary intake affects plasma lipids, apolipoproteins, cholesteryl ester transfer to high-density lipoprotein and redox metabolism: a prospective study in women.  Acai is a fruit native to the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Previous studies show that acai fruits are relatively high in polyphenol antioxidants and monounsaturated fatty acids.  This observational study in 40 healthy women found that eating 200 grams of acai pulp for a month was associated with an improved antioxidant status. It also suggested that acai may improve blood lipid metabolism.   10. Sleep  Association between Serum Vitamin D Levels and Sleep Disturbance in Hemodialysis Patients.   Sleep disturbances are a common and serious side effect of hemodialysis, which is a mechanical procedure that cleans the blood of people with kidney failure.  This observational study showed that low levels of vitamin D were associated with an increased risk of sleep disturbances in patients undergoing hemodialysis.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 3rd–10th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 10, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Alternate-day fasting does not counteract the negative health effects of long-term bed rest.  A low-calorie diet and weight loss may effectively treat type 2 diabetes.  A high dose of fructose causes an acute rise in blood pressure, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease if consumed regularly.  A high-protein diet combined with strength exercises counteracts the loss of muscle mass associated with weight-loss in older people.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and offspring adiposity and cardiometabolic traits in childhood.   The Mediterranean diet (MD) is associated with a reduced risk of many chronic diseases. It’s a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, olive oil, seafood and fish.  This observational study showed that when pregnant mothers followed a diet that closely resembled the MD, their children were less likely to gain excessive weight or develop high blood pressure.   Relationship between Selected Serum Metallic Elements and Obesity in Children and Adolescent in the U.S.  This observational study in American children and adolescents found that high circulating levels of zinc were associated with a reduced risk of obesity.  In contrast, high levels of copper and manganese were linked to an increased risk of obesity.   Early Antibiotic Exposure and Risk of Childhood Obesity in Latinos.   This observational study in Latin American children found that antibiotic use before six months of age was significantly linked to an increased risk of obesity and weight gain at age two.   Weight Gain and Obesity in Infants and Young Children Exposed to Prolonged Antibiotic Prophylaxis.   Some previous observational studies indicate that antibiotic use may increase the risk of weight gain among children, although the evidence is inconsistent overall.  This controlled study in healthy children showed that using a combination of the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim didn’t affect weight gain in the subsequent 18 months.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Do grape polyphenols improve metabolic syndrome components? A systematic review.   Like most other fruits, grapes are rich in polyphenol antioxidants. A high intake of polyphenols has been associated with a variety of health benefits.  However, this review concluded that no strong evidence supports claims that grape polyphenols improve blood sugar levels, blood pressure or blood lipids.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Chronic dietary exposure to branched chain amino acids impairs glucose disposal in vegans but not in omnivores.   Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are a category of amino acids that are elevated in obese, insulin-resistant people.  This study showed that taking 15–20 grams of BCAA daily for three months reduced insulin sensitivity (IS) in vegans, but not in meat eaters. This is probably because BCAA intake is lower in vegans to begin with, and their IS is higher.   Association between diet quality measured by the Healthy Food Intake Index and later risk of gestational diabetes—a secondary analysis of the RADIEL trial.   Gestational diabetes (GD) is when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes become resistant to the effects of insulin. As in other types of diabetes, GD leads to excessively high blood sugar levels.  This observational study in pregnant, obese women found that a high adherence to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations was associated with lower fasting blood sugar levels, possibly reducing the risk of GD.   The effect of alternate-day caloric restriction on the metabolic consequences of 8 days of bed rest in healthy lean men: a randomized trial.   Excessive inactivity and bed rest has various adverse metabolic effects, such as insulin resistance and an increase in belly fat.  This controlled study in healthy men showed that an eight-day bed rest caused insulin resistance, increased belly fat and worsened mood. Alternate-day fasting and an energy balance did not counteract these adverse effects.   Reversal of type 2 diabetes in youth who adhere to a very-low-energy diet: a pilot study.   This eight-week, controlled study in eight children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes showed that a very low-calorie diet reduced body weight, improved blood sugar control and decreased liver fat.  The results suggest that a low-calorie diet may be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes.  4. Heart Health  Acute Metabolic and Endocrine Responses Induced by Glucose and Fructose in Healthy Young Subjects: A Double-blinded, Randomized, Crossover Trial.   Fructose is a type of sugar that makes up 50% of table sugar (sucrose) and typically 55% of high-fructose corn syrup. Most people in developed countries consume fructose in unnaturally high amounts.  This controlled study in healthy, young people showed that eating 75 grams of fructose increased systolic blood pressure and caused several other unfavorable metabolic changes, compared to the same amount of glucose.   Serum Vitamin D and Change in Lipid Levels over 5 years: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.   This observational study showed that vitamin D deficiency was linked to a decrease in HDL cholesterol over time. It also led to higher total cholesterol levels, relative to HDL cholesterol.   The Relation of Serum Potassium Concentration with Cardiovascular Events and Mortality in Community-Living Individuals.   This observational study showed that high levels of potassium were linked to a higher risk of death from heart disease and other causes.  The association was stronger in participants who used diuretics, which are drugs used to treat high blood pressure, edema and glaucoma.   5. Cancer  Race-dependent association of sulfidogenic bacteria with colorectal cancer.   This observational study associated a high intake of meat, fat and protein with a greater abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria in the colon. These bacteria produce a type of gas known as hydrogen sulfide.  Hydrogen sulfide (HS) may promote inflammation. The researchers hypothesized that high levels of HS may raise the risk of colorectal cancer. More studies are needed to confirm this theory.   The Association between Alcohol Consumption and Breast Density: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.   High breast density, usually measured as percent breast density (PBD), is a risk factor for breast cancer.  This meta-analysis of observational studies found that a high alcohol intake was associated with greater PBD, suggesting that excessive alcohol intake may raise the risk of breast cancer.   6. Brain and Mental Health  The Mediterranean Diet and ADHD in Children and Adolescents.   Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental condition characterized by hyperactivity, daydreams, problems with focusing, difficulties organizing or completing tasks and following instructions.  This observational study showed that children with ADHD were less likely to follow a diet resembling the Mediterranean dietary pattern, which is characterized by a high intake of vegetables, olive oil and fish and low intake of red meat and sugar.   7. Digestive Health  Reinforcement of intestinal epithelial barrier by arabinoxylans in overweight and obese subjects: a randomized controlled trial.   The intestinal lining controls what compounds are able to pass from the intestines into circulation. This function is known as intestinal permeability (IP). Obesity and other metabolic disorders are associated with impaired IP.  This six-week controlled study in 47 overweight people suggests that supplementing with 7.5–15 grams of arabinoxylan (AX) per day improves the gut microbiota, but the researchers detected no significant changes in IP.   8. Bone Health  Serum Phosphate Is Associated with Fracture Risk: The Rotterdam Study and MrOS.   This observational study found that high circulating phosphate levels were associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, independently of dietary phosphate intake or bone mineral density.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Effect of a high protein diet and/or resistance exercise on the preservation of fat free mass during weight loss in overweight and obese older adults: a randomized controlled trial.   This controlled study found that following a high-protein diet did not significantly counteract the loss of fat-free mass (including muscles) during modest weight loss in older adults who were overweight and obese.  However, a high protein intake combined with strength exercises significantly increased fat-free mass.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (February 24th–March 3rd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 3, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Supplementing with green tea extract may significantly reduce the recurrence of colorectal polyps after removal.  An egg breakfast reduced appetite throughout the day, compared to an oat porridge.  Taking folic acid and vitamin B6 supplements may reduce migraine symptoms.  A high intake of lychees has been implicated in outbreaks of neurological illness among Indian children.    New Research From Around the World  Many recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Pain  Women’s Health  Contaminants and Food Safety    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Identification of dietary patterns associated with obesity in a nationally representative survey of Canadian adults: application of a priori, hybrid, and simplified dietary pattern techniques.   This observational study in Canadian adults showed that energy-dense, high-fat or low-fiber dietary patterns were associated with an increased risk of obesity.  These dietary patterns were all characterized by a high intake of fast foods, sugary soda and refined grains and generally low in fruits and vegetables.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  The effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid co-supplementation on glycemic control and lipid concentrations in patients with gestational diabetes.   This controlled study in women with diabetes during pregnancy showed that supplementing with both vitamin D and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) for six weeks led to greater benefits than taking one without the other.  Specifically, the combined supplement improved blood sugar and insulin levels, as well as insulin sensitivity.   3. Heart Health  Fish consumption in relation to myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality among women and men with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study.   This observational study in diabetic adults aged 45–84 showed that eating 1–2 servings of fish per week was linked to a 47% lower risk of death from heart disease, compared to eating less than 3 servings per month.  Eating more than 1–2 servings per week didn’t provide additional benefits. In fact, 2–3 servings per day were only associated with a 25% lower risk of death from heart disease, compared to 3 servings per month.   Consumption of Red Meat, but Not Cooking Oils High in Polyunsaturated Fat, Is Associated with Higher Arachidonic Acid Status in Singapore Chinese Adults.   Arachidonic acid (AA) is an omega-6, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Previous studies have linked a high intake of AA to inflammation and a higher risk of heart disease.  This observational study in 269 healthy, Chinese adults showed that a higher intake of red meat was associated with a higher AA status. In contrast, a high intake of PUFAs was not linked to elevated AA levels.   Dairy Food Intake Is Inversely Associated with Risk of Hypertension: The Singapore Chinese Health Study.   This observational study in 37,124 Chinese adults found that a high intake of dairy was linked to a slightly reduced risk of high blood pressure. The association was dose dependent.  Non-dairy calcium intake, which contributed to 80% of the total calcium intake among the participants, was not associated with reduced blood pressure.   4. Cancer  Associations of Calcium and Milk Product Intakes with Incident, Sporadic Colorectal Adenomas.   Colorectal adenomas (CAs) are benign tumors or polyps in the colon or rectum. They may increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.  This observational study showed that a high intake of calcium was associated with a slightly lower risk of CAs.   Green Tea Extracts for the Prevention of Metachronous Colorectal Polyps among Patients Who Underwent Endoscopic Removal of Colorectal Adenomas: a Randomized Clinical Trial.   This controlled study in 176 Korean patients who had undergone colorectal polyp (adenoma) removal showed that taking green tea extract supplements reduced the recurrence of polyps by 44%, compared to a placebo.   5. Appetite and Eating  Consuming Two Eggs per Day, as Compared to an Oatmeal Breakfast, Decreases Plasma Ghrelin while Maintaining the LDL/HDL Ratio.   Ghrelin is a hormone that increases appetite. This controlled study in 50 young adults showed that eating two eggs for breakfast reduced self-reported appetite and levels of ghrelin throughout the day, compared to eating oat porridge.  Additionally, eating an egg breakfast every day for one month didn’t adversely affect blood lipid levels. While levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol increased, their ratio didn’t change.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Relationship between coffee consumption and stroke risk in Korean population: the Health Examinees (HEXA) Study.   This observational study in 146,830 middle-aged adults from South Korea showed that drinking three or more cups of coffee per day was linked to a 38% lower risk of stroke in women. No significant association was found in men.   Vitamin B12, homocysteine and depressive symptoms: a longitudinal study among older adults.   This observational study in older, Dutch adults found no significant association between circulating vitamin B12 levels and depressive symptoms.   7. Eyes and Vision  Dietary Intakes of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid and Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.   The macula is the central part of the eye’s retina. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most common eye diseases and may lead to visual impairments and blindness.  This observational study in 75,889 women over age 50 showed that a high intake of omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) prevented or delayed intermediate AMD. However, there was no significant association with advanced AMD.   8. Kidney and Urinary Health  Serum Potassium and Short-term Clinical Outcomes Among Hemodialysis Patients: Impact of the Long Interdialytic Interval.   Hyperkalemia is when circulating levels of potassium become excessively high. It is common among patients with kidney failure who have to undergo hemodialysis, which is a mechanical process that cleans the blood.  This observational study showed that hyperkalemia was associated with a poorer prognosis and increased risk of hospitalization and death.   9. Bone Health  The influence of genetic susceptibility and calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on fracture risk.   This observational study in 5,823 women showed that combined vitamin D and calcium supplements were not associated with bone fractures among those who were genetically predisposed to fractures and low bone mineral density (BMD).  In contrast, vitamin D and calcium supplements were linked to a significantly lower risk of fractures in women who were not predisposed to low BMD.   10. Muscles and Physical Performance  Polyphenols and Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.   Polyphenols are a large group of antioxidants found in most plant-derived foods. A high intake of polyphenol-rich foods has been linked to a variety of health benefits.  This meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that taking polyphenol supplements for at least a week improved athletic performance by 1.9%, on average. Studies investigating quercetin showed a performance improvement of 2.8%.   Creatine Loading Does Not Preserve Muscle Mass or Strength During Leg Immobilization in Healthy, Young Males: A Randomized Controlled Trial.   Creatine is one of the most popular supplements used to enhance muscle growth and strength.  This controlled study in healthy, young men showed that supplementing with 20 grams of creatine per day for five days did not prevent the loss of muscle strength caused by disuse, compared to a placebo.   11. Pain  The effects of folic acid and pyridoxine supplementation on characteristics of migraine attacks in migraine patients with aura: A double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.   This was a controlled study in people suffering from migraines and auras. Auras are perceptual disturbances that occur before a migraine begins. These disturbances often involve strange lights, unpleasant smells or confused thoughts.  Taking folic acid (5 mg/day) and vitamin B6 (80 mg/day) reduced all symptoms of a migraine attack, compared to taking folic acid alone or a placebo. However, after accounting for all factors, there were no significant differences between groups.   12. Women’s Health  Urinary Phytoestrogen Concentrations Are Not Associated with Incident Endometriosis in Premenopausal Women.   Endometriosis (EM) is when the endometrium — the tissue that grows inside the uterus — starts growing outside the uterus. The main symptoms of EM are pelvic pain and infertility.  This observational study in pre-menopausal women showed that a high intake of phytoestrogens — plant compounds that resemble the female sex hormone estrogen — was not associated with an increased risk of EM.   13. Contaminants and Food Safety  Association of acute toxic encephalopathy with litchi consumption in an outbreak in Muzaffarpur, India, 2014: a case-control study.  Lychees are small tropical fruits native to Asia. They contain a toxin known as hypoglycin A .  This study in Indian children suggests that a high intake of lychees may be responsible for outbreaks of neurological illness among children in Muzaffarpus, which is India’s largest lychee-growing region.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (February 17th–24th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 24, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Magnesium supplements can improve insulin sensitivity in those who are low in magnesium.  A protein-restricted diet benefits people with metabolic acidosis caused by kidney disease.  High red meat intake is associated with a poor prognosis among kidney disease patients.  Fish oil supplements may help burn wound patients recover.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Liver Health  Lung Health  Arthritis  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Skin Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Acute effects of a beverage containing bitter melon extract (CARELA) on postprandial glycemia among prediabetic adults.   Bitter melon is a fruit that is widely grown in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. It is commonly used in Asian cuisine. Previous studies show that bitter melons benefit people with type 2 diabetes by reducing the rise in blood sugar after meals.  This study examined the effects of a bitter melon beverage (BMB) on blood sugar rise during a glucose tolerance test . The BMB reduced the blood sugar rise in only half of the participants and had no effect on insulin levels.   Adding Salt to Meals as a Risk Factor of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case–Control Study.   This observational study showed that people who regularly added salt to prepared meals were at a two-fold greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who never added salt to their meals.   Effect of Magnesium Supplementation on Insulin Resistance in Humans: a Systematic Review.   This meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that magnesium supplements may improve insulin sensitivity among people who are low in magnesium.   2. Heart and Blood Vessels  Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with incident peripheral artery disease among white and black adults in the ARIC study cohort.   Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is when the arteries that supply the legs, arms and other body parts (excluding the brain and heart) with blood start to narrow. As a result, PAD may restrict blood supply to these body parts.  This observational study showed that low vitamin D levels were associated with an increased risk of PAD in both white and black adults. People deficient in vitamin D were 49% more likely to develop PAD, compared to those who had adequate levels.   Elevated systolic blood pressure of children in the United States is associated with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations related to body mass index: NHANES 2007 to 2010.  Previous studies show that adults with high blood pressure tend to be low in vitamin D. This observational study examined whether a similar association is found in children.  The study showed that children deficient or low in vitamin D were more likely to have high blood pressure. The authors suggested that this association may be related to greater body fat among children with high blood pressure.   3. Appetite and Eating  Higher sensitivity to sweet and salty taste in obese compared to lean individuals.   Previous studies have not found consistent links between taste perception and body mass index.  However, this study suggests that obese individuals are more sensitive to sweet and salty flavors. It also indicates that they perceive sweet, salty and sour more intensely than normal-weight people.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Intake of tryptophan-enriched whey protein acutely enhances recall of positive loaded words in patients with multiple sclerosis.   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease. It’s characterized by a variety of neurological symptoms, such as mental problems, impaired memory, tremors and lack of coordination.  This crossover study in MS patients found that taking whey protein supplements enriched with tryptophan made it easier for them to remember words with a positive meaning, compared to taking non-enriched whey protein supplements.   Adherence to a Healthy Nordic Diet and Risk of Stroke.   The Nordic Diet is characterized by a high intake of fish, apples, pears, cabbage, root vegetables, rye bread and oatmeal.  This observational study in 55,338 adults showed that a greater adherence to the Healthy Nordic Food Index score was linked to a significantly lower risk of stroke.   5. Kidney and Urinary Health  Very Low-Protein Diet (VLPD) Reduces Metabolic Acidosis in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease: The “Nutritional Light Signal” of the Renal Acid Load.   Metabolic acidosis (MA) is when the pH of the blood decreases to harmful levels. In healthy people, the kidneys rid the blood of excess acid. In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), metabolic acidosis is common.  This study in patients with CKD found that following a very low-protein diet that was rich in fruits and vegetables significantly reduced metabolic acidosis and improved health.   Diet Soda Consumption and Risk of Incident End Stage Renal Disease.   Renal disease, also known as nephropathy or kidney disease, is a general term referring to impaired kidney function due to disease or injury.  This observational study found that a high consumption of diet soda was linked to a higher risk of end-stage renal disease.   Red Meat Intake and Risk of ESRD.   Chronic kidney disease is when kidney function is gradually impaired over time. Previous controlled trials suggest that limiting protein intake may reduce or stop the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  This observational study in Chinese adults aged 45–74 showed that those who consumed the most red meat were 40% more likely to develop ESRD than those who ate the least. High intake of poultry, fish, eggs and dairy was not linked to ESRD.   6. Liver Health  Fatty acid and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: meta-analyses of case-control and randomized controlled trials.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that omega-3 supplements, especially those that contain DHA, may help treat NAFLD.   7. Lung Health  Maternal Folate Intake during Pregnancy and Childhood Asthma in a Population-based Cohort.  This observational study in pregnant women showed that those who supplemented with folic acid at or above the recommended dose, in addition to eating a folate-rich diet, had children who were slightly more likely to become asthmatic.   8. Arthritis  Long-term dietary quality and risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis in women.   Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the joints. It’s characterized by inflamed, swollen and painful joints, most commonly in the hands.  This observational study in 169,989 women showed that a high score on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index was linked to a reduced risk of developing RA before the age of 55.   Folic acid therapy reduces serum uric acid in hypertensive patients: a substudy of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT).   Uric acid forms when the body breaks down dietary purines . The kidneys are responsible for removing uric acid from the blood. Some people may accumulate high levels of uric acid, potentially leading to gout, a type of inflammatory arthritis.  This controlled trial in 15,364 Chinese people with high blood pressure showed that taking 0.8 mg of folic acid daily for up to five years significantly reduced the increase in uric acid levels.   9. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Serum Lipid Profile and Oxidative Stress in Pediatric Patients on Regular Hemodialysis: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study.   Hemodialysis (HD) is a mechanical process that cleans the blood in patients with kidney disease. This controlled study in children undergoing regular hemodialysis investigated the health effects of omega-3 supplements.  The study showed that taking 1 gram of omega-3 supplements daily for four months significantly reduced total cholesterol levels and caused a rise in two circulating antioxidants — glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase.   10. Skin Health  Effect of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from fish oil in major burn patients: A prospective randomized controlled pilot trial.   Omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA, are anti-inflammatory. As a result, researchers believe they may benefit patients with burn wounds, which are characterized by severe inflammation.  This controlled study in burn patients showed that a low-fat diet (LFD) that provided 50% of fat from fish oil reduced the risk of severe sepsis , septic shock and gut dysfunction, compared to a LFD without fish oil.   11. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Cheese Consumption and Risk of All-Cause Mortality: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies.   Numerous studies have investigated the association of cheese consumption and chronic disease, but their findings have been conflicting.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that long-term cheese consumption is not associated with an increased risk of dying from any cause.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (February 10th–17th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 17, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   High intake of flavonoids is associated with lower fat mass.  Extra virgin olive oil is linked to a lower risk of osteoporosis-related fractures.  Losing weight may reduce daytime sleepiness.  Arginine supplements may improve sports performance.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Sleep  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Higher dietary flavonoid intakes are associated with lower objectively measured body composition in women: evidence from discordant monozygotic twins.   Flavonoids are a large family of polyphenol antioxidants found in all whole, plant-sourced foods, especially fruits and vegetables.  This observational study in 2,734 healthy, female twins showed that a higher intake of flavonoids was associated with lower fat mass, independently of genetic or common environmental factors.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Sweetened beverage intake in association to energy and sugar consumption and cardiometabolic markers in children.   This observational study in 687 children found that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages (SWB) was linked to a 6% higher intake of sugar overall.  It also showed that intake of artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) was associated with a 1.7% higher intake of sugar from solid foods, but not total sugar intake. Both SWBs and ASBs were linked to higher blood sugar levels.   3. Heart Health  Saturated Fat Consumption and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease and Ischemic Stroke: A Science Update.   This review discussed the association between saturated fat intake and heart disease. The authors concluded that a high intake of saturated fat is not linked to a higher risk of heart disease or stroke.  However, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fatty acids (excluding trans-fats) appears to be linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.   Longitudinal association between fasting blood glucose concentrations and first stroke in hypertensive adults in China: effect of folic acid intervention.   Diabetic people are at a higher risk of stroke. This observational study in 20,327 Chinese adults with high blood pressure showed that high fasting blood sugar levels were associated with an increased risk of having a stroke for the first time.  The study also showed that folic acid supplements reduced this risk by 34% among those with diabetes or high fasting blood sugar levels (7.0 mmol/L or above).   Beta-Glucans Supplementation Associates with Reduction in P-Cresyl Sulfate Levels and Improved Endothelial Vascular Reactivity in Healthy Individuals.   Beta-glucans are a large family of fiber known for their cholesterol-lowering properties. This controlled study in 26 healthy adults examined the health effects of taking barley beta-glucan supplements.  Compared to a placebo, the fiber supplements reduced levels of LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol and improved blood vessel function.   Dietary Patterns in Relation to Cardiovascular Disease Incidence and Risk Markers in a Middle-Aged British Male Population: Data from the Caerphilly Prospective Study.   This observational study in middle-aged, British men showed that a dietary pattern characterized by white bread, butter, lard, chips and sugar-sweetened beverages was linked to a 35% higher risk of heart disease and 77% higher risk of stroke.  In contrast, a diet characterized by a higher intake of biscuits, whole-grain cereals, sweet puddings, dairy (excluding cheese and butter) and lower alcohol intake was associated with a 24% lower risk of heart disease and 32% lower risk of stroke.   4. Cancer  Green Tea Consumption and the Risk of Liver Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.   This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that regularly drinking high amounts of green tea is associated with a lower risk of liver cancer. Drinking four cups of green tea per day appeared to provide the greatest protection.   Dietary Fat Consumption and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Risk: A Meta-analysis.   Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is a type of cancer that starts in the white blood cells. This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that a high fat intake, especially from animal fat, was associated with an increased risk of NHL.   Dietary Inflammatory Index and Risk of Colorectal Adenoma Recurrence: A Pooled Analysis.   The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods may be pro-inflammatory, whereas others may be anti-inflammatory or neutral.  Colorectal adenoma (CA) is a type of tumor found in the colon or rectum. It may develop into colon cancer over time. This observational study in people with a history of CA showed that the DII was not significantly associated with CA.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Diet and ADHD, Reviewing the Evidence: A Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses of Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials Evaluating the Efficacy of Diet Interventions on the Behavior of Children with ADHD.   Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental condition characterized by hyperactivity, daydreams, problems with focusing, difficulties organizing or completing tasks and following instructions.  This review concluded that polyunsaturated fatty acids are probably not an effective ADHD treatment. Also, the evidence linking artificial food colors with ADHD is still limited. However, the “few-foods diet” is very promising.   6. Digestive Health  No association of alcohol use and the risk of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease: data from a European Prospective cohort study (EPIC).   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is divided into Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), depending on what part of the digestive system it affects. It is characterized by chronic and severe intestinal inflammation.  This observational study in 262,451 Europeans showed that alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with the risk of developing either CD or UC.   7. Bone Health  Obesity is a concern for bone health with aging.   This review concluded that obesity adversely affects bone health. While obesity may improve bone mineral density, these beneficial effects cannot counteract the negative effects of obesity on bone quality.   Extra Virgin Olive Oil Consumption Reduces The Risk of Osteoporotic Fractures in The Predimed Trial.   This observational study in 870 Spanish people aged 55–80 years old showed that a higher intake of extra virgin olive oil was linked to a lower risk of osteoporosis-related bone fractures.  Specifically, those who consumed the most extra virgin olive oil had a 51% lower risk of bone fractures, compared to those who consumed the lowest amounts.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  The effect of l-arginine supplementation on body composition and performance in male athletes: a double-blinded randomized clinical trial.   L-arginine is an amino acid that makes up the structure of proteins. It is found in adequate amounts in most high-protein foods and can be produced by the body.  This controlled trial in 56 Iranian, male soccer players showed that taking 2-gram arginine supplements daily for 45 days significantly improved sports performance, compared to a placebo.   Efficacy of a novel formulation of L-Carnitine, creatine, and leucine on lean body mass and functional muscle strength in healthy older adults: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study.   Loss of muscle mass is a concern among older people. This 8-week, controlled study in adults aged 55–70 years old compared three supplements: 1) a mix of carnitine, leucine, creatine and vitamin D3, 2) L-carnitine alone and 3) a placebo.  The mixed supplement significantly improved muscle mass and strength, compared to a placebo. In contrast, taking carnitine alone didn’t lead to significant improvements.   Postexercise repletion of muscle energy stores with fructose or glucose in mixed meals.   This controlled study in eight male endurance athletes lowered muscle energy stores through diet and exercise. It then compared the effects of either fructose (9.7 g/lb or 4.4 g/kg) or the same amount of glucose as part of mixed meals.  Meals containing glucose or fructose were equally effective at replenishing muscle carb and fat stores. However, fructose increased carb oxidation and decreased net carb storage, blood sugar levels and next-day performance.   9. Sleep  Does intentional weight loss improve daytime sleepiness? A systematic review and meta-analysis.  Previous studies suggest that obese people are more likely to become sleepy during the daytime than normal-weight individuals.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that weight loss may reduce daytime sleepiness. The findings support the idea that obesity may be the causal factor in this association.   10. Pregnancy and Infant Health  High serum copper level is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia in Asians: a meta-analysis.   Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a complication of pregnancy characterized by elevated blood pressure and high amounts of protein in the urine. It increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and may lead to seizures (eclampsia) if untreated.  This meta-analysis of observational studies in Asian women concluded that high circulating levels of copper are associated with an increased risk of PE. However, individual studies have provided inconsistent results.   11. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Fruit and vegetables consumption is associated with higher vitamin intake and blood vitamin status among European adolescents.   This observational study in 702 European adolescents found that people with adequate fruit and vegetable intake tended to have higher circulating levels of vitamin B6, folate, vitamin C, beta-carotene and vitamin E.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (February 3rd–10th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 10, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   If you normally skip breakfast, adding breakfast to your daily diet will probably lead to weight gain.  Eating Brazil nuts or taking green tea extract supplements may improve risk factors for colon cancer.  Drinking a beverage rich in flavanone antioxidants temporarily improves blood flow in the brain.  Calcium impairs the absorption of lycopene.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  A randomized controlled trial to study the effects of breakfast on energy intake, physical activity, and body fat in women who are nonhabitual breakfast eaters.   This four-week controlled study investigated the effects of adding breakfast to the diet of 49 women who normally didn’t eat breakfast.  The study showed that when the women started eating breakfast, their daily calorie intake increased by 266 calories, on average. They also gained more weight than those who didn’t eat breakfast, or 1.5 pounds (0.7 kg), on average.   Associations of prenatal and childhood antibiotic use with child body mass index at age 3 years.   This observational study found that high antibiotic use in early childhood was associated with a greater body mass index when the children were three years old.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Host–microbiome interactions in human type 2 diabetes following prebiotic fibre (galacto-oligosaccharide) intake.  This controlled study in 29 men with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with the diabetic drug Metformin compared the effects of taking 5.5 grams of a prebiotic fiber mixture (galacto-oligosaccharide) or the same amount of maltodextrin .  The study found no significant differences in bacterial growth or changes in their microbiota. Also, there were no differences in inflammatory markers, intestinal permeability or insulin sensitivity between groups.   3. Heart Health  Diets high in resistant starch increase plasma levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide, a gut microbiome metabolite associated with CVD risk.   Resistant starch (RS) is a type of dietary fiber found in whole grains and other starch-rich foods. The amount of RS tends to increase when starch-rich foods are cooked and then cooled. Eating a diet high in RS affects the gut microbiota.  This crossover study in 52 adults showed that a low-carb, RS-rich diet was associated with higher circulating levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TNO). High TNO is a marker of increased heart disease risk.   4. Cancer  Phyto-oestrogens and colorectal cancer risk: a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of observational studies.   Phytoestrogens are a category of plant compounds that can bind with estrogen receptors in the body, imitating the effects of estrogen. Soy isoflavones are perhaps the best known examples of phytoestrogens.  This review of observational studies found some evidence associating a high intake of phytoestrogens, isoflavones and lignans with a reduced risk of colon cancer. However, the findings were inconsistent.   Supplementation with Brazil nuts and green tea extract regulates targeted biomarkers related to colorectal cancer risk in humans.   This controlled trial investigated the effects of eating Brazil nuts, which are rich in selenium, and green tea extract capsules on risk markers of colorectal cancer.  Eating either Brazil nuts or green extract improved risk markers of colorectal cancer, but taking both at the same time didn’t provide additional benefits.   Dietary inflammatory index and prostate cancer risk in a case–control study in Mexico.   The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Previous studies indicate that a high DII may increase the risk of prostate cancer.  However, this observational study in Mexican men didn’t find any significant association between DII and the risk of prostate cancer or its aggressiveness.   Does dietary fibre prevent the recurrence of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas?  This Cochrane review of five controlled studies in people with a history of colon polyps, which may increase the risk of colon cancer, found no evidence that following a high-fiber diet for 2–8 years reduced their risk of developing more polyps.  Interestingly, those who increased their fiber intake had a 1% increased risk of developing colon polyps. However, the quality of the evidence was considered low.   5. Appetite and Eating  Effects of whole-grain rye porridge with added inulin and wheat gluten on appetite, gut fermentation and postprandial glucose metabolism: a randomised, cross-over, breakfast study.   This crossover study in healthy adults examined whether the appetite-suppressing effects of a whole grain rye porridge could be improved by replacing some of it with fermented dietary fiber (inulin) or plant protein (gluten).  The researchers discovered that replacing a portion of a rye porridge with inulin or gluten did not further enhance its appetite-suppressing effects.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Is there an association between diet and depression in children and adolescents? A systematic review.   This review concluded that healthy dietary patterns are associated with a reduced risk of depression in children and adolescents, whereas unhealthy diets seem to increase the risk. Yet, the evidence is not entirely consistent.   Association between carbohydrate nutrition and prevalence of depressive symptoms in older adults.   This observational study in older adults showed that a high intake of easily absorbed carbs like sugar was associated with an increased risk of depression.  In contrast, high intakes of fruits, vegetables and fiber were all linked to a lower risk of depression.   The effects of flavanone-rich citrus juice on cognitive function and cerebral blood flow: an acute, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial in healthy, young adults.   This crossover study in young adults compared the effects of two, calorie-matched, 500 ml-beverages on cognitive function and blood flow in the brain. Of the two beverages, one was rich in flavanone antioxidants.  The study showed that the flavanone-rich beverage temporarily improved blood flow in the brain and improved performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, compared to the control.   The use of vitamin E in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).   This Cochrane review of controlled studies found no evidence to suggest that vitamin E supplements either benefit or harm brain function or cognition, nor do they help treat Alzheimer’s disease.   Effect of ω-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Young People at Ultrahigh Risk for Psychotic Disorders: The NEURAPRO Randomized Clinical Trial.  Psychosis is a mental disorder characterized by the loss of contact with reality. This usually causes personality changes, unusual behavior and difficulties with daily activities.  This controlled study in 304 adults at a high risk of psychotic disorders showed that taking omega-3 supplements did not reduce their risk of psychosis.   7. Digestive Health  High Dietary Intake of Specific Fatty Acids Increases Risk of Flares in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis in Remission During Treatment With Aminosalicylates.   Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation and small sores (ulcers) in the lining of the colon. The main symptom of an active disease is blood-mixed diarrhea.  This observational study in 412 UC patients found that a high intake of specific fatty acids was associated with an increased risk of relapse. These included myristic acid , which is found in high amounts in palm oil and coconut oil.   8. Kidney and Urinary Health  Intake of n-3 fatty acids and long-term outcome in renal transplant recipients: a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study.  Taking omega-3 supplements, especially EPA and DHA, may improve the health and long-term outcomes of kidney transplant patients (KTPs).  However, this observational study in KTPs found no significant association between EPA and DHA intake and the risk of death. Additionally, a high intake of the omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was linked to an increased risk of death.   9. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Dietary calcium impairs tomato lycopene bioavailability in healthy humans.   Lycopene is an antioxidant carotenoid found in high amounts in tomatoes, guavas and watermelons. Its absorption is rather inefficient, and only a portion of what you eat is available to your body.  This crossover study showed that dietary calcium impairs the absorption of lycopene. Specifically, lycopene absorption was reduced by 83% when 500 mg of calcium carbonate were added to tomato paste.   Cholecalciferol v. ergocalciferol for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) repletion in chronic kidney disease: a randomised clinical trial.   Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are very often deficient in vitamin D. Dietary vitamin D can be divided into two categories: ergocalciferol (from plants) and cholecalciferol (from animals).  This controlled study in patients with CKD showed that cholecalciferol raised circulating levels of calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) more than ergocalciferol.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (January 27th–February 3rd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 3, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Buckwheat seems to have beneficial effects on blood lipids and blood sugar, compared to semi-whole grain wheat.  Vitamin D deficiency may partly explain the high incidence of prostate cancer in African-American men.  Depression and bipolar disorder are associated with a low intake of omega-3 fatty acids.  Obesity appears to cause a slight shrinkage in brain volume.  Taking omega-3 supplements improves liver function and reduces liver fat.  Regular yogurt consumption in infancy is associated with a reduced risk of eczema in early childhood.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Liver Health  Skin Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Ramadan model of intermittent fasting for 28 days had no major effect on body composition, glucose metabolism, or cognitive functions in healthy lean men.   In the Islamic calendar, Ramadan is a month of fasting. It is a type of intermittent fasting characterized by total fasting (no drink or food) from sunrise to sunset.  This crossover study in healthy men showed that fasting 14 hours every day for a month didn’t have any significant effects on fat mass, muscle mass, blood sugar control or cognitive performance.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Acute caffeine ingestion reduces insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects: a systematic review and meta-analysis.   Previous studies suggest that people who regularly drink coffee are at a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. However, it is currently unknown how coffee affects sugar metabolism.  This meta-analysis of controlled studies looked into the effects of caffeine, the main stimulant in coffee. The researchers concluded that a dose of caffeine temporarily reduces insulin sensitivity in healthy people.   3. Heart Health  Maternal Urinary Bisphenol A Concentration During Midterm Pregnancy and Children’s Blood Pressure at Age 4Novelty and Significance.   Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic compound used to make plastic. The largest dietary source of BPA is food stored in plastic packaging or containers. Intake levels are usually evaluated by measuring BPA in urine.  This observational study found that a high urinary BPA concentration in pregnant mothers was linked to higher blood pressure in their children when they had reached four years of age.   Effects of a diet rich in arabinoxylan and resistant starch compared with a diet rich in refined carbohydrates on postprandial metabolism and features of the metabolic syndrome.  This crossover study in people with metabolic syndrome compared the health effects of a four-week diet that was rich in cereal fiber, arabinoxylan and resistant starch (HCD), to a western-style, refined-carb diet (WSD).  The HCD didn’t improve any features of metabolic syndrome, compared to the WSD. However, the HCD improved fasting LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol among those who also took statins.   Comparison between Mediterranean and Vegetarian diets for cardiovascular prevention: The cardiveg study.   This crossover study in healthy adults compared the effects of the Mediterranean diet (MED) and a vegan diet (VEG) for three months each. Both diets provided an equal amount of calories.  The study found that both diets were equally effective at reducing body weight and fat mass. On average, the VEG significantly decreased cholesterol levels by 2.9%, LDL cholesterol by 5.1% and insulin by 6.9%, while the MED reduced triglycerides by 8.9%.   Consumption of buckwheat products and cardiovascular risk profile: A randomized, single-blinded crossover trial.   This crossover study in 21 people at a high risk of heart disease examined the health effects of eating semi-whole grain wheat products enriched with buckwheat.  Eating enriched products reduced total cholesterol by 4.7%, LDL cholesterol by 8.5%, triglycerides by 15%, blood sugar by 5.8% and insulin by 17%, compared to the start of the study. In comparison, non-enriched products had minimal effects.   4. Cancer  Association between Serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin D and Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men.   African-American men are at a higher risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer (APC) than men with a different genetic background. Researchers believe low levels of vitamin D may partly explain this difference.  This observational study showed that vitamin D deficiency was strongly associated with an increased risk of APC in African-American men. Long-term, controlled studies need to confirm these findings.   Fish intake and the risk of brain tumor: a meta-analysis with systematic review.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that a high intake of fish may be associated with a lower risk of brain cancer.   Red and processed meat consumption and risk of bladder cancer: a dose–response meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.   This meta-analysis of observational studies found that a high intake of processed meat may increase the risk of bladder cancer. The link between total red meat intake and bladder cancer was less consistent.   Colorectal Adenomas in Participants of the SELECT Randomized Trial of Selenium and Vitamin E for Prostate Cancer Prevention.  Colorectal adenomas are benign tumors in the colon or rectum. Since they may develop into colorectal cancer, they are considered a risk factor for cancer.  This observational study showed that taking vitamin E or selenium supplements was not associated with a lower risk of colorectal adenomas.   Grilled, Barbecued, and Smoked Meat Intake and Survival Following Breast Cancer.  Smoked, grilled or barbecued meat is the main dietary source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which have been associated with an increased risk of cancer.  This prospective observational study in women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer showed that a high intake of smoked, grilled or barbecued meat (after diagnosis) made them 31% more likely to have died five years later.   Flavanone-rich citrus beverages counteract the transient decline in postprandial endothelial function in humans: a randomised, controlled, double-masked, cross-over intervention study.   Citrus fruits are rich in a class of polyphenols known as flavanones . This controlled study in healthy men examined the effects of citrus flavanones on endothelial function (ED).  Endothelial dysfunction may adversely affect blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease. However, citrus flavanones improved ED for up to seven hours after a meal, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Polyunsaturated fatty acids and recurrent mood disorders: Phenomenology, mechanisms, and clinical application.   Evidence indicates that deficiency in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids — DHA and EPA — is associated with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.  This article reviewed the evidence and suggested that patients with mood disorders should be routinely screened and treated for omega-3 deficiency if necessary.   Initial body fat gain is related to brain volume changes in adolescents: A repeated-measures voxel-based morphometry study.   Previous studies show that obese people tend to have a lower brain volume than normal-weight individuals. It is unclear whether a low brain volume makes people susceptible to weight gain to begin with, or if being obese causes brain shrinkage.  This study in 62 adolescents found that brain volume didn’t predict weight gain over the following 2–3 years. However, those who gained the most body fat showed the greatest reduction in brain volume.   6. Digestive Health  Patients With Celiac Disease Reported Higher Consumption of Added Sugar and Total Fat Than Healthy Individuals.   Celiac disease is the most severe form of gluten intolerance. It is an autoimmune disorder that mainly affects the small intestine. The symptoms include fatigue, malnutrition and skin disorders, to name a few.  This observational study found that people with celiac disease had a more unbalanced diet, compared to healthy controls. For instance, they had a higher intake of added sugar and total fat and a lower intake of protein.   7. Liver Health  Omega-3 fatty acids as a treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis.  This meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that omega-3 supplements can improve liver function and reduce liver fat in children.   Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Impact on metabolic profile.   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells. It is often associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.  This observational study showed that people who followed a dietary pattern resembling the Mediterranean diet were less likely to suffer from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.   8. Skin Health  Yogurt consumption in infancy is inversely associated with atopic dermatitis and food sensitization at 5 years of age: a hospital-based birth cohort study.   Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a chronic skin condition characterized by itchy, dry and red skin.  This observational study found that regular yogurt consumption during infancy significantly reduced the risk of eczema at five years of age. Additionally, children who ate yogurt were less likely to be sensitive to food allergens.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (January 20th–27th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 27, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Drinking moderate amounts of orange juice may improve health-related markers in obese people following a calorie-reduced diet.  Tomato products and lycopene may improve heart health.  Probiotics and inulin may improve lung function and reduce asthma symptoms.  Taking fish oil or omega-3 supplements during pregnancy may reduce the child’s risk of asthma and lung infections.  Eating cured meat might worsen asthma symptoms over time.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Liver Health  Lung Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Inflammation    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Breastfeeding in Infancy Is Associated with Body Mass Index in Adolescence: A Retrospective Cohort Study Comparing American Indians/Alaska Natives and Non-Hispanic Whites.   This was an observational study in Alaskan natives and non-Hispanic, white adolescents and adults.  It showed that those who were breastfed in infancy had a lower body mass index as adults, compared to those who were never breastfed.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Orange juice allied to a reduced-calorie diet results in weight loss and ameliorates obesity-related biomarkers: A randomized controlled trial.  This controlled trial in obese people following a calorie-reduced diet showed that drinking 500 ml of pure orange juice per day reduced fasting insulin levels by 18%, insulin resistance by 33% and LDL cholesterol by 24%.  Also, it reduced levels of the inflammatory marker C-reative protein (CRP) by 33%, and it didn’t impair the participants’ weight loss success. Those who consumed orange juice lost just as much weight as those who didn’t.   Association between Dietary Energy Density and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the Women’s Health Initiative.   Energy density, also known as calorie density, refers to how many calories one gram of a food provides. Energy-dense foods include those that are high in fat and low in water and fiber.  This prospective observational study showed that higher energy density was linked to a greater risk of type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women and those with a larger waist circumference.   Diet-dependent acid load and type 2 diabetes: pooled results from three prospective cohort studies.  Acid-producing diets have been linked to an increased risk of disease. This large observational study in adults found that a higher dietary acid load was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.   A longitudinal study of iron status during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes: findings from a prospective, multiracial cohort.  Too much iron in the body (iron overload) can lead to type 2 diabetes (T2D). This observational study in 107 pregnant, diabetic women indicated that milder levels of iron overload may also raise the risk of T2D.  The researchers found that elevated iron stores in the body were associated with an increased risk of diabetes during pregnancy.   3. Heart Health  Effect of soy on metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial.   This 12-week, controlled trial in people with metabolic syndrome showed that replacing 30 grams of animal-source protein with soy protein per day reduced body weight by 1.5%.  It also improved the levels of several blood lipids. For example, soy protein reduced triglycerides by 4.9% and LDL cholesterol by 5.3%, potentially decreasing the risk of heart disease.   Tomato and lycopene supplementation and cardiovascular risk factors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.   Tomatoes are rich in a carotenoid antioxidant known as lycopene .  This meta-analysis of controlled trials concluded that eating tomato products or taking lycopene supplements may improve several heart disease risk factors. These include blood lipids, blood pressure and blood vessel function.   4. Cancer  Dietary Patterns and Pancreatic Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis.   This observational study found that healthy dietary patterns were associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer.  Additionally, light to moderate alcohol intake was associated with a reduced risk, but heavy or “Western-type” drinking was associated with an increased risk.   5. Digestive Health  Meat intake and risk of diverticulitis among men.   Pouches form in the colon wall of some people. Typically, they do not cause any symptoms, but when they become inflamed, they lead to diverticular disease, also known as diverticulitis .  This large observational study showed that a high intake of red meat, especially processed red meat, was associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis.   Western Dietary Pattern Increases, Whereas Prudent Dietary Pattern Decreases, Risk of Incident Diverticulitis in a Prospective Cohort Study.   Diverticulitis is when pouches lining the colon wall become inflamed. The main symptoms include belly pain, nausea, fever, bloating, gas and lack of appetite.  This observational study in 46,295 men found that the Western dietary pattern was linked to an increased risk of diverticulitis. In contrast, a healthier dietary pattern was associated with a lower risk.   Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Benefit of the Probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 in Non-Patients With Symptoms of Abdominal Discomfort and Bloating.   This controlled study examined the health effects of Bifidobacterium infantis , which is a type of probiotic bacteria, in people who experienced bloating and abdominal discomfort at least twice a week.  B. infantis may improve symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, this study showed that it did not reduce symptoms in healthy people who weren’t diagnosed with IBS.   Zinc Deficiency is Associated with Poor Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a collective term for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, both of which are conditions caused by severe inflammation in the digestive tract.  This observational study in people with IBD showed that zinc deficiency significantly increased the risk of adverse disease outcomes. IBD patients should make sure to get enough zinc from their diet.   6. Kidney and Urinary Health  Dietary Protein Sources and Risk for Incident Chronic Kidney Disease: Results From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.   Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is when the kidneys gradually lose their function.  This observational study showed that a high intake of red and processed meat was associated with an increased risk of CKD. In contrast, low-fat dairy and legumes protected against CKD.   7. Liver Health  Coffee Intake Is Associated with a Lower Liver Stiffness in Patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Hepatitis C, and Hepatitis B.   Previous studies have indicated that coffee may be beneficial for people with liver disease.  This observational study in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease showed that drinking two or more cups of coffee per day was linked to lower liver stiffness, which is a marker of liver health.   8. Lung Health  Soluble Fibre Meal Challenge Reduces Airway Inflammation and Expression of GPR43 and GPR41 in Asthma.   Gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when they ferment soluble fiber. Animal studies suggest SCFAs may have anti-inflammatory effects.  This small controlled trial in adults with asthma showed that a meal containing probiotics and the soluble fiber inulin improved lung function and markers of lung inflammation, compared to a control meal containing simple carbs.   Fish Oil–Derived Fatty Acids in Pregnancy and Wheeze and Asthma in Offspring.   This controlled study in pregnant women investigated the benefits of taking 2.4 grams of fish oil containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids during the third trimester of pregnancy.  The study showed that fish oil reduced the risk of persistent wheezing, asthma and lung infections by around 7% in the infant, compared to olive oil.   Cured meat intake is associated with worsening asthma symptoms.  This observational study followed 971 French people for seven years. It found that a higher intake of cured meat was associated with worsening asthma symptoms over time.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Effects of Beetroot Juice Supplementation on Cardiorespiratory Endurance in Athletes. A Systematic Review.   This review concluded that beetroot juice supplements may improve endurance in athletes, although the evidence is conflicting.  Overall, there is no solid evidence that combining beetroot juice with other supplements either negates or amplifies its potential benefits. Yet, there are some indications that caffeine might undermine its effects.   Ecologically Valid Carbohydrate Intake during Soccer-Specific Exercise Does Not Affect Running Performance in a Fed State.   This controlled study in 16 male soccer players found that drinking 250 ml of a high-carb beverage consisting of 12% carbs before running did not affect their performance.   10. Inflammation  Associations of Diet Quality and Physical Performance with Inflammatory Markers in Community-dwelling Frail, Elderly People.   This observational study in elderly people found that a high diet quality, which was assessed using mean adequacy ratio (MAR), was associated with lower levels of the inflammatory marker IL-6 .  It also showed that better physical performance was linked to lower levels of the inflammatory marker TNF-α.   Plasma Inflammation Markers of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Pathway but Not C-Reactive Protein Are Associated with Processed Meat and Unprocessed Red Meat Consumption in Bavarian Adults.   Previous studies show that eating a lot of red or processed meat is associated with a higher risk of chronic disease. Some researchers believe inflammation may partially explain the link.  However, this observational study found that high intakes of processed meat and unprocessed red meat were associated with lower levels of the inflammatory marker TNF-α .   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (January 13th–20th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 20, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Taking probiotics might cause a slight, additional weight loss while following a calorie-reduced diet.  People with metabolic syndrome have higher vitamin E requirements.  Taking resveratrol supplements might help maintain brain health as you age.  Probiotic supplements can lower levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Brain and Mental Health  Bone Health  Arthritis  Inflammation  Infections and Immune Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  The additional effects of a probiotic mix on abdominal adiposity and antioxidant status: A double-blind, randomized trial.   This randomized controlled trial in overweight or obese women following a weight loss diet examined the effects of a probiotic supplement.  Taking probiotics increased the women’s antioxidant status and reduced waist circumference by an additional 1.73%, compared to a weight loss diet without any probiotics.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Metabolic syndrome increases dietary α-tocopherol requirements as assessed using urinary and plasma vitamin E catabolites: a double-blind, crossover clinical trial.  This controlled study suggests that people with metabolic syndrome have higher vitamin E requirements than healthy people.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  The Association of Bread and Rice with Metabolic Factors in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.   This observational study in 426 Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes found that a high intake of bread was associated with higher fasting blood sugar levels. In contrast, rice intake was not linked to blood sugar levels.   4. Heart Health  Dietary intake and peripheral arterial disease incidence in middle-aged adults: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.  Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is when arteries (other than those that supply the heart or brain with blood) start to narrow. PAD may restrict blood supply to the legs, arms or other body parts.  This observational study found that a high intake of meat was linked to a greater risk of PAD. In contrast, greater alcohol intake was associated with a lower risk.   Effects of free sugars on blood pressure and lipids: a systematic review and meta-analysis of nutritional isoenergetic intervention trials.   This meta-analysis of 28 studies investigated the health effects of substituting sugar with complex carbs, calorie for calorie.  The researchers concluded that replacing sugar with complex carbs had no effects on blood pressure or body weight. Also, the effects of sugar on the blood lipid profile were unclear.   Methylxanthines enhance the effects of cocoa flavanols on cardiovascular function: randomized, double-masked controlled studies.   Cocoa is rich in antioxidants, such as flavanols. These antioxidants improve blood vessel function and may partly explain why cocoa is linked to improved heart health.  This study showed that other cocoa constituents — caffeine and theobromine — enhanced the absorption of cocoa flavanols. This led to greater improvements in blood vessel function, compared to eating the flavanols alone.   Incorporating freeze-dried strawberry powder into a high-fat meal does not alter postprandial vascular function or blood markers of cardiovascular disease risk: a randomized controlled trial.   This randomized crossover trial in overweight or obese adults examined the health effects of adding 40 grams of freeze-dried strawberries to a high-fat meal.  The study showed that eating a single dose of 40 grams of strawberry powder had no significant effects on blood sugar control or triglyceride levels.   Acute Black Tea Consumption Improves Cutaneous Vascular Function in Healthy Middle-Aged Humans.   Black tea is rich in antioxidants like flavonoids. These flavonoids are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, possibly because they improve the function of blood vessels.  This randomized controlled trial in 20 healthy adults showed that drinking 200 ml of black tea improved blood vessel function afterwards. These findings suggest that black tea may improve heart health.   The Role of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Heart Failure: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.   Heart failure is when the heart is unable to pump enough blood throughout the body to meet its needs. Controlled studies investigating the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on heart failure have provided conflicting findings.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that omega-3 supplements might improve heart function in patients with heart failure, especially those with a type called dilated cardiomyopathy .   5. Brain and Mental Health  Effects of Resveratrol on Cognitive Performance, Mood and Cerebrovascular Function in Post-Menopausal Women; A 14-Week Randomised Placebo-Controlled Intervention Trial.   Resveratrol is an antioxidant and phytoestrogen found in plant foods, such as the skin of red grapes and blueberries. Studies suggest it may have various health benefits, including increasing blood flow in the brain.  This randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women showed that taking 75 mg of resveratrol supplements twice daily for 14 weeks significantly improved cognition and brain function.   B-Vitamin Intake and Biomarker Status in Relation to Cognitive Decline in Healthy Older Adults in a 4-Year Follow-Up Study.   This prospective observational study followed healthy people aged 60–88 years old for four years.  The study showed that a low intake of vitamin B6 increased the rate of their cognitive decline, suggesting that an adequate intake of vitamin B6 might be important in maintaining brain health among older people.   Effect of Ramadan fasting on fatigue, mood, sleepiness, and health-related quality of life of healthy young men in summer time in Germany: A prospective controlled study.   In the Islamic calendar, Ramadan is a month of fasting. It is a type of intermittent fasting characterized by total fasting (no drink or food) from sunrise to sunset.  This study showed that 19 days of Ramadan fasting did not significantly affect mood, fatigue or quality of life, when compared to those who didn’t fast. In addition, fasting led to fat and muscle loss.   Two Days of Calorie Deprivation Induced by Underfeeding and Aerobic Exercise Degrades Mood and Lowers Interstitial Glucose but Does Not Impair Cognitive Function in Young Adults.   This randomized crossover study in 23 adults found that following a very low-calorie diet and aerobic exercise program for two days significantly reduced fasting blood sugar levels and impaired mood. However, it didn’t have any effects on cognition.   6. Bone Health  Peripheral skeleton bone strength is positively correlated with total and dairy protein intakes in healthy postmenopausal women.  Previous studies show that a high protein intake is associated with an increased quantity and density of bone minerals.  This observational study in healthy, postmenopausal women indicates that a high protein intake also improves bone microstructure and strength.   7. Arthritis  Marine Oil Supplements for Arthritis Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.   Fish oil supplements are often taken to relieve arthritis pain, but the evidence of their effectiveness is limited.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that fish oil supplements may benefit people with rheumatoid arthritis, but there is less evidence for any benefits for those with osteoarthritis.   8. Inflammation  Impact of Probiotic Administration on Serum C-Reactive Protein Concentrations: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Control Trials.   C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory marker, meaning that its levels rise in response to inflammation in the body.  This meta-analysis concluded that taking probiotic supplements can significantly reduce circulating levels of CRP. In contrast, probiotics seem to have no effects on other inflammatory markers, such as IL-10 and TNF- α .   9. Infections and Immune Health  Intake of vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc and polyunsaturated fatty acids and upper respiratory tract infection—a prospective cohort study.  This observational study in Swedish adults aged 25–64 years old showed that high intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E, docosahexaenoic aci d (DHA) and arachidonic acid were associated with a reduced risk of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI).  In contrast, a high intake of vitamin E and/or zinc was linked to a higher risk of URTI among men.   10. Longevity and Healthy Aging  The Association of Hot Red Chili Pepper Consumption and Mortality: A Large Population-Based Cohort Study.   This large observational study showed that those who consumed the highest amounts of red chili peppers were at the lowest risk of death from any cause.  Since this was an observational study, it is unclear whether this protective effect was caused by chili peppers or other associated factors.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (January 6th–13th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 13, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Taking omega-3 supplements may reduce arthritic pain.  Green tea extract might reduce pain and improve knee function in people with osteoarthritis.  Infant formula containing 2′-fucosyllactose — a sugar found in breastmilk — significantly reduces inflammation.  Vitamin B12-enriched toothpaste could be a good option for vegans.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Inflammation  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Heart Health  Short-term Effects of High-Dose Caffeine on Cardiac Arrhythmias in Patients With Heart Failure: A Randomized Clinical Trial.  Previous studies suggest that high doses of caffeine may cause an abnormal heart rhythm (arrythmia) in some people, but the idea is controversial.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with heart failure showed that ingesting a high dose of caffeine (500 mg) over a five-hour period did not lead to arrythmia.   Whole-Grain Intake and Mortality from All Causes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that a high intake of whole grains is associated with a lower risk of death from heart disease, cancer or all causes combined.  Whole grains appeared to be especially protective against death from heart disease.   2. Cancer  Meat, Fish, Poultry, and Egg Intake at Diagnosis and Risk of Prostate Cancer Progression.  This prospective observational study in 971 men treated for prostate cancer showed that a high intake of well-done red meat was associated with a greater risk of serious prostate cancer, as well as relapse.  In contrast, high intakes of poultry and fish were linked to a reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer and relapse. Egg consumption was not associated with prostate cancer progression.   3. Brain and Mental Health  Association of dietary cholesterol and egg intakes with the risk of incident dementia or Alzheimer disease: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.   This prospective observational study from Finland showed that egg consumption and cholesterol intake were not associated with the risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.   Executive functioning and dietary intake: Neurocognitive correlates of fruit, vegetable, and saturated fat intake in adults with obesity.   This observational study in obese adults found that those who ate higher amounts of fruits and vegetables had better inhibitory control and planning ability than those who ate lower amounts.   Iron Status in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common mental disorder in children. It is characterized by poor attention and behavioral problems.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that low ferritin levels were linked to an increased risk of ADHD in children. Ferritin is an iron storage protein that circulates in the blood. Low ferritin levels indicate iron deficiency.   4. Eyes and Vision  Provitamin A Carotenoid-Biofortified Maize Consumption Increases Pupillary Responsiveness among Zambian Children in a Randomized Controlled Trial.  Deficiency or low levels of vitamin A may cause night blindness or an impaired ability to see in the dark. The condition is easily prevented by regular consumption of vitamin A or pro-vitamin A carotenoids.  This controlled trial in Zambian children showed that eating biofortified maize, which is rich in pro-vitamin A carotenoids, improved eye response to changes in light among those with low vitamin A levels. However, it did not affect night blindness.   5. Kidney and Urinary Health  Renal and Systemic Effects of Calorie Restriction in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes With Abdominal Obesity: A Randomized Controlled Trial.   This randomized controlled trial in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and abdominal obesity showed that following a calorie-reduced diet improved kidney function, insulin sensitivity and risk markers for heart disease.  The authors concluded that eating less may reduce the risk of kidney disease and heart disease in people with T2D and abdominal obesity.   6. Bone Health  Greater Intake of Fruit and Vegetables Is Associated with Greater Bone Mineral Density and Lower Osteoporosis Risk in Middle-Aged and Elderly Adults.   This observational study in Chinese, middle-aged and elderly adults showed that a high intake of fruits and vegetables was linked to greater bone mineral density and a reduced risk of osteoporosis.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Effect of tart cherry juice on recovery and next day performance in well-trained Water Polo players.  This small, randomized controlled trial in male water polo players examined the effects of drinking juice made from tart Montmorency cherries for six days.  The study found that the cherry juice had no significant effects on exercise performance and recovery. Also, it had no effects on inflammatory markers.   Effects of Short-Term Carbohydrate Restrictive and Conventional Hypoenergetic Diets and Resistance Training on Strength Gains and Muscle Thickness.  This eight-week study in overweight and obese individuals showed that following a calorie-reduced diet and strength-exercise program significantly increased muscle strength and maintained muscle thickness.  The researchers also found that the carb content of the diet didn’t affect the results. A low-carb, calorie-reduced diet appeared to be as effective as a conventional diet.   Effects of acute carbohydrate ingestion on anaerobic exercise performance.  Carbs may improve performance during endurance exercises. This study in young athletes suggests that carbs may also have performance benefits when consumed during strength exercises.   8. Arthritis  The effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on arthritic pain: A systematic review.  This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on arthritic pain. The researchers found that 10 out of 18 reviewed studies suggested that taking omega-3 supplements reduced pain.  However, more research is needed to examine the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in large populations and over longer periods.   Green tea (Camellia sinensis) for patients with knee osteoarthritis: A randomized open-label active-controlled clinical trial.  Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints. The main symptoms are joint swelling, stiffness and pain.  This randomized controlled trial in people with osteoarthritis found that taking green tea extract reduced self-reported pain and improved physical function. However, not all measures of pain and stiffness improved significantly.   9. Inflammation  Effects of a High Protein and Omega-3-Enriched Diet with or Without Creatine Supplementation on Markers of Soreness and Inflammation During 5 Consecutive Days of High Volume Resistance Exercise in Females.  This controlled trial in women examined the effects of a high-protein diet, which was supplemented with whey protein, omega-3s and creatine monohydrate, during five days of high-volume strength training.  The study showed that taking omega-3 and/or creatine supplements did not reduce levels of inflammatory markers. Additionally, these supplements did not affect training volume or reduce self-reported muscle soreness.   Similar to Those Who Are Breastfed, Infants Fed a Formula Containing 2′-Fucosyllactose Have Lower Inflammatory Cytokines in a Randomized Controlled Trial.  2′-fucosyllactose (2FS) is a type of sugar (oligosaccharide) found in human milk. It is the most common human milk oligosaccharide (HMO), comprising around 30% of the total amount. Previous studies suggest HMOs are beneficial to infant health.  This controlled trial in formula-fed infants showed that consuming a formula that contained 2FS lowered circulating levels of inflammatory markers by 29–83%, compared to consuming a conventional formula.   10. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Effect of Coenzyme Q10 on Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress and Cardiac Function in Hemodialysis Patients: The CoQ10 Biomarker Trial.  Coenzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) is an antioxidant that plays an important role in the body’s energy generation and antioxidant defenses. Dietary sources include supplements, liver, meat, fish, parsley and broccoli.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with kidney failure showed that taking 600 or 1,200 mg of Co-Q10 supplements daily for four months reduced markers of oxidative stress. However, it is unclear if Co-Q10 improves kidney function.   11. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Vitamin B-12-fortified toothpaste improves vitamin status in vegans: a 12-wk randomized placebo-controlled study.  Plant-sourced food does not contain any vitamin B12, although small amounts may be found in certain types of seaweed. However, there are several way that vegans can get vitamin B12. These include supplements, injections and toothpaste.  This 12-week randomized controlled trial in vegans showed that using a B12-enriched toothpaste is an effective way to increase levels of vitamin B12.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (December 30th–January 6th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 6, 2017  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Eating chia seeds may be an effective weight loss strategy, even better than oat bran.  Taking coenzyme Q10 supplements at a low dose may improve blood sugar control.  Zinc supplements may reduce the severity of infections in malnourished children.  Low vitamin D levels increase the risk of eczema, and vitamin D supplements reduce its symptoms.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Inflammation  Infections and Immune Health  Skin Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Salba-chia (Salvia hispanica l.) in the treatment of overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in overweight or obese people with type 2 diabetes examined the effects of eating 30 grams of chia seeds for every 1,000 calories of food consumed every day for half a year.  The study found that chia seeds reduced body weight more than a similar amount of oat bran. Specifically, those that consumed chia seeds lost 4.2 lbs (1.9 kg), on average, whereas those that ate oat bran lost only 0.7 lbs (0.3 kg).   Cesarean birth is not associated with early childhood body mass index.  Children who are born via Cesarean section (CS) develop a different gut microbiota than children born vaginally. Some research suggests that CS may predispose children to weight gain and obesity.  However, this observational study showed that the type of birth was not associated with children’s height, weight or body mass index at age three or six.   Prospective associations of meat consumption during childhood with measures of body composition during adolescence: results from the GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts.  This observational study in adolescents showed that a high intake of poultry at age 10 was associated with greater fat mass at age 15. On the other hand, high intake of total meat, or red meat, was linked to greater lean mass.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  A meta-analysis of randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trials suggests that coenzyme Q10 at low dose improves glucose and HbA1c levels.  Coenzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) is an antioxidant that plays an important role in the body’s energy generation and antioxidant defenses. Dietary sources include liver, meat, fish, parsley and broccoli.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that taking Co-Q10 reduces blood sugar levels, especially at lower doses (less than 200 mg/day) and when it is taken for less than three months.   Effects of Low versus High Glycemic Index Sugar-Sweetened Beverages on Postprandial Vasodilatation and Inactivity-Induced Impairment of Glucose Metabolism in Healthy Men.  This trial in 13 healthy men compared the effects of a drink sweetened with maltodextrin and sucrose (MDS), which cause high spikes in blood sugar, with a drink containing isomaltulose (IMS), which doesn’t raise blood sugar nearly as much.  The study showed that blood vessel function was better after drinking IMS, compared to MDS. IMS also attenuated insulin resistance caused by a period of low physical activity.   The Association of Arsenic Exposure and Metabolism With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes in Youth: The SEARCH Case-Control Study.  Arsenic is an environmental contaminant. In some areas, its levels are high in drinking water or certain types of food, such as rice. High intake of arsenic has been associated with a variety of health problems.  This observational study found that total intake of arsenic was not linked to type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, certain subtypes of arsenic — monomethylated arsenic and dimethylated arsenic — were associated with a greater risk.   3. Heart Health  Dietary soy and natto intake and cardiovascular disease mortality in Japanese adults: the Takayama study.  Natto is a traditional, Japanese food made from fermented soybeans. This observational study in Japanese adults showed that a high intake of natto was associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease.   Treatment for 6 months with fish oil-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has neutral effects on glycemic control but improves dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetic patients with abdominal obesity: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in 100 patients with type 2 diabetes and abdominal obesity examined the health effects of taking 4 grams of fish oil, which is rich in omega-3s, daily for half a year.  The study found that fish oil did not significantly affect blood sugar control. However, it improved levels of triglycerides and “good” HDL cholesterol, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.   4. Cancer  Soy Food Intake and Biomarkers of Breast Cancer Risk: Possible Difference in Asian Women?  Previous studies suggest that soy foods may protect against breast cancer in Asian women, but not in Western women.  This observational study indicated possible differences in markers for breast cancer risk between Asian and Western women.   Association between Dietary Isoflavones in Soy and Legumes and Endometrial Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Soy foods are high in isoflavones , which are plant compounds that resemble estrogen, the female sex hormone. For this reason, isoflavones are categorized as phytoestrogens.  This meta-analysis of observational studies found a weak association between a high consumption of isoflavones from soy foods and a lower risk of endometrial cancer (EC), which affects the inner lining of the uterus.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Dietary Tofu Intake and Long-term Risk of Death from Stroke in a General Population.  Tofu is a soy protein product made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the curds. This prospective observational study in 9,244 Japanese people showed that eating tofu was not associated with the risk of stroke.  However, when women younger than 65 were examined separately, a high intake of tofu reduced the risk of cerebral hemorrhage (CH). CH is a type of stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.   6. Digestive Health  Oral zinc supplementation for treating diarrhoea in children.  This Cochrane review concluded that taking zinc supplements may reduce the duration of diarrhea in malnourished children older than six months.   7. Kidney and Urinary Health  The impact of oat (Avena sativa) consumption on biomarkers of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease: a parallel randomized clinical trial.  This randomized controlled trial in 52 patients with chronic kidney disease found that eating more than 50 grams of oats daily for two months improved circulating levels of potassium and albumin.  These changes are associated with improved kidney function.   8. Bone Health  The Association Between Protein Intake by Source and Osteoporotic Fracture in Older Men: A Prospective Cohort Study.  Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weak or brittle bones. In addition to a sufficient intake of calcium, an adequate intake of protein may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.  This observational study in older men found that a high protein intake was associated with a lower risk of a major osteoporotic fracture. This especially applied to a high intake of animal protein.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  The influence of caffeine ingestion on strength and power performance in female team-sport players.  This randomized controlled trial in female team sports players showed that caffeine supplements increased eccentric strength and power during treadmill running.  Eccentric strength is the strength of a muscle while it’s lengthening. The study found no effects of caffeine on concentric strength (when muscles are contracting) or isometric strength, which is the strength of a muscle when it’s not moving.   10. Inflammation  The Effect of Iron Fortification on Iron (Fe) Status and Inflammation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  Young children in developing countries frequently suffer from iron deficiency. This randomized controlled trial in toddlers showed that eating iron-enriched cereal significantly increased their iron stores.  However, iron-enriched cereal also increased systemic inflammation, a potentially adverse effect. In comparison, non-enriched cereal or red meat did not affect inflammatory markers.   11. Infections and Immune Health  Zinc supplementation for the prevention of pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months.  This Cochrane review concluded that zinc supplements may reduce the risk of pneumonia in 2–5-year-old, malnourished children. However, the researchers considered the strength of the evidence low. Further studies are needed.   12. Skin Health  Vitamin D Status and Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Atopic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a chronic skin condition characterized by itchy, dry and red skin.  This systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that circulating levels of vitamin D are lower in people with eczema. Also, taking vitamin D supplements may reduce eczema symptoms.   25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations, Asthma and Eczema in Childhood: The Generation R Study.  This observational study in six-year-old children found that low circulating vitamin D levels were associated with an increased risk of eczema. In contrast, poor vitamin D status appeared to protect against asthma.   13. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Is consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks during pregnancy associated with birth weight?  This large, prospective observational study from Norway found that a high intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks among pregnant mothers was associated with a low birth weight.  In contrast, when mothers had diabetes during pregnancy, a high intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks was linked to a greater birth weight.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (December 22nd–30th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 30, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Chia seeds appear to have greater benefits for blood sugar control than flax seeds.  Famine in childhood may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood.  Taking magnesium supplements can reduce blood pressure among hypertensive people.  The ability to resist cravings can make a significant difference when trying to lose weight.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Lung Health  Inflammation  Skin Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  It is not how much you crave but what you do with it that counts: behavioural responses to food craving during weight management.  This observational study asked 2932 participants about their food cravings. The results showed that people with obesity who had recently managed to resist their cravings were more likely to successfully lose weight over the following 7 weeks.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Association between the Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome and the Level of Coffee Consumption among Korean Women.  Metabolic syndrome is a group of adverse health conditions associated with abdominal obesity. These include elevated blood pressure, poor blood sugar control, high levels of triglycerides and low levels of HDL-cholesterol.  This observational study in Korean women found that high coffee consumption was linked with a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Comparison of flax (Linum usitatissimum) and Salba-chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seeds on postprandial glycemia and satiety in healthy individuals: a randomized, controlled, crossover study.  This randomized, crossover trial in 15 healthy individuals compared the effects of flax seeds and chia seeds on appetite and blood sugar levels after eating 50 grams of sugar (glucose).  Flax seeds and chia seeds improved blood sugar control, compared to sugar alone. They also reduced appetite. However, chia seeds appeared to have greater benefits than flax seeds, possibly because of their higher viscosity.   Association of famine exposure during early life with the risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood: a meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis of 11 observational studies concluded that famine during early life may increase people‘s risk of developing type 2 diabetes while adults.   Elevated iron status and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that high circulating iron levels were linked with an increased risk of diabetes during pregnancy.   The acute effects of inulin and resistant starch on postprandial serum short-chain fatty acids and second-meal glycemic response in lean and overweight humans.  This randomized crossover study investigated the effects of two types of fiber – inulin (24 g) or resistant starch (28 g)  – and compared them with 75 grams of sugar (glucose).  The researchers found that inulin significantly increased the circulating levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), but had no effects on blood sugar control. In contrast, resistant starch had no effects on SCFAs, but improved blood sugar control.   4. Heart Health  Oral magnesium supplementation improves endothelial function and attenuates subclinical atherosclerosis in thiazide-treated hypertensive women.  Endothelial function refers to the condition of the inner lining of the blood vessels. When the endothelium is dysfunctional, the tiny muscles lining the blood vessels make them either too narrow or too dilated.  This trial in women with high blood pressure showed that taking magnesium supplements, 600 mg/day for half a year, significantly reduced blood pressure and improved endothelial function, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.   Effects of purified anthocyanin supplementation on platelet chemokines in hypocholesterolemic individuals: a randomized controlled trial.  Anthocyanins are a group of antioxidant polyphenols responsible for the color of many fruits and vegetables. Growing evidence suggests they may reduce the risk of atheroclerosis by lowering the levels of platelet chemokines (PCs).  This randomized controlled trial in people with high cholesterol levels confirmed previous research, showing that taking anthocyanin supplements, 320 mg daily for 6 months, reduced the circulating levels of PCs.   Relationship of Iron Deficiency and Serum Ferritin Levels with Pulmonary Hypertension: The Jackson Heart Study.  Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is when blood pressure is excessively high in the arteries that transport blood to the lungs. Iron deficiency is very common in people with PH.  This observational study examined whether iron deficiency could explain PH. It found that people with or without iron deficiency were at an equal risk of developing PH. Iron deficiency doesn’t seem to play a role.   Aronia berry polyphenol consumption reduces plasma total and LDL cholesterol in former smokers without lowering biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress: a randomized controlled trial.  Aronia berries, also known as chokeberries, are rich in polyphenol antioxidants. This 3-month randomized controlled trial examined the effects of an aronia berry supplement on heart disease risk factors in 49 former smokers.  The study showed that taking 500 mg of aronia extract every day for 3 months reduced fasting total choleterol by 8% and LDL-cholesterol levels by 11%, compared to a placebo. However, it didn‘t affect markers of inflammation or oxidative stress.   5. Appetite and Eating  Phosphorus Supplementation Recovers the Blunted Diet-Induced Thermogenesis of Overweight and Obese Adults: A Pilot Study.  The metabolic rate increases temporarily after eating, an effect known as diet-induced thermogenesis. However, this increase may be blunted in overweight and obese people.  This small trial showed that taking phosphorus supplements improved the diet-induced thermogenesis in overweight and obese adults. It also reduced their appetite after meals. Similar effects were not seen in normal-weight individuals.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Meta-Analysis of Milk Consumption and the Risk of Cognitive Disorders.  Previous studies on the association of milk intake with the risk of cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer‘s disease, dementia and cognitive decline, have provided conflicting results.  This meta-analysis of 7 observational studies with a total of 11,941 participants concluded that those with the highest milk intake are at a reduced risk of cognitive disorders.   7. Digestive Health  Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease Are Associated with Decreased Serum Selenium Concentrations and Increased Cardiovascular Risk.  Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), which is characterized by stomach pain, diarrhea and weight loss.  This observational study found that the circulating levels of selenium, which is an antioxidant mineral, were significantly lower in IBS patients, compared to healthy people. This especially applied to patients with CD.   8. Kidney and Urinary Health  Dietary Patterns and Clinical Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease: The CKD.QLD Nutrition Study.  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is when kidney function is gradually impaired over time.  This observational study found that a diet high in fruits and vegetables delayed the progression of CKD and improved the chance of survival among patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD. Low alcohol intake or abstinence were also linked with better outcomes.   DASH dietary pattern and chronic kidney disease in elderly Korean adults.  DASH stands for “dietary approaches to stop hypertension.” It is a dietary pattern designed and promoted by the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  This observational study in Korean adults showed that high adherence to the DASH diet and/or high fiber intake were linked to a lower risk of chronic kidney disease.   9. Lung Health  Clinical impact of vitamin D treatment in cystic fibrosis: a pilot randomized, controlled trial.  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disorder that mostly affects the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and frequent lung infections. It also adversely affects the digestive system, liver and kidneys. Vitamin D insufficiency is common among people with CF.  This small randomized controlled trial in CF patients showed that vitamin D supplements can reduce inflammation and improve lung function.   10. Inflammation  Anti-inflammatory and ROS Suppressive Effects of the Addition of Fiber to a High Fat High Calorie Meal.  Previous studies suggest that certain high-fat meals may be pro-inflammatory. In other words, they increase the levels of inflammatory markers, compounds that indicate low-grade inflammation in the body.  This small randomized controlled trial showed that adding 30 grams of soluble fiber to a high-fat meal reduced the levels of blood sugar, lipopolysaccharides, reactive oxygen species and inflammatory markers.   11. Sleep  Effect of Six-Month Diet Intervention on Sleep among Overweight and Obese Men with Chronic Insomnia Symptoms: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  This randomized controlled trial in overweight and obese men with chronic insomnia showed that following a calorie-reduced diet with an optimized nutrition composition reduced depression and improved self-reported sleep duration and quality.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (December 16th–22nd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 23, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   High intake of fructose causes insulin resistance in the liver.  Black tea counteracts the adverse effects of a high-fat meal on blood vessel function.  High tryptophan intake is associated with a reduced risk of depression.  Vitamin D3 supplements may reduce the frequency of respiratory tract infections in older individuals.    New Research From Around the World  Many recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Oral Health  Infections and Immune Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Relation between milk-fat percentage, vitamin D, and BMI z score in early childhood.  This observational study in 2745 healthy children showed that high consumption of whole milk, enriched with vitamin D, was associated higher circulating vitamin D levels and a lower body mass index.   Mindfulness-based interventions for adults who are overweight or obese: a meta-analysis of physical and psychological health outcomes.  Mindfulness or mindful eating is when people pay full attention to the food they are eating as well as their eating habits. It helps people become aware of their bodies’ hunger and satiety signals.  This meta-analysis concluded that weight loss programs focusing on mindfulness provide physical and psychological benefits for overweight or obese people.   Relevance of Morning and Evening Energy and Macronutrient Intake during Childhood for Body Composition in Early Adolescence.  This observational study found that regularly eating a low-fat, high-carb breakfast during childhood was associated with a greater fat mass in early adolescence.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effect of fructose consumption on insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic subjects: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diet-intervention trials.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies concluded that short-term, high fructose intake promotes the development of insulin resistance in the liver.  In contrast, fructose didn’t affect insulin sensitivity in other body tissues, such as muscles. Further studies need to investigate the long-term effects of high fructose intake.   3. Heart Health  Black Tea Increases Circulating Endothelial Progenitor Cells and Improves Flow Mediated Dilatation Counteracting Deleterious Effects from a Fat Load in Hypertensive Patients: A Randomized Controlled Study.  The inner lining of the blood vessels is called endothelium . When the endothelium is dysfunctional, the blood vessels are either too narrow or too dilated. Narrow blood vessels increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with high blood pressure showed that drinking black tea, twice a day for 8 days, counteracted the negative effects of a high-fat, cream-based meal on endothelial function.   4. Cancer  Dietary Protein Sources and Incidence of Breast Cancer: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies.  This meta-analysis of 46 observational studies concluded that the risk of breast cancer is not affected by the intake of poultry, fish, eggs, nuts or whole milk.  However, high intake of red meat — both fresh and processed — were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. In contrast, soy food and skim milk was linked with a reduced risk.   5. Appetite and Eating  Whey protein consumption after resistance exercise reduces energy intake at a post-exercise meal.  This randomized controlled trial showed that consuming a protein beverage after strength exercise reduced calorie intake at a meal an hour later, compared to a carb beverage.  The whey protein beverage provided around 24 grams of whey protein, whereas the carb beverage contained 27 grams of carbs, on average.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Tryptophan Intake in the US Adult Population Is Not Related to Liver or Kidney Function but Is Associated with Depression and Sleep Outcomes.  Tryptophan is an amino acid found in most protein-based foods, especially eggs, fish, cheese and meat.  This observational study showed that a high intake of tryptophan was associated with a reduced risk of depression and increased sleep duration. In contrast, it was not linked to liver or kidney function.   Relationships Between Caffeine Intake and Risk for Probable Dementia or Global Cognitive Impairment: The Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study.  This observational study in women past 64 years of age suggests that a high caffeine intake may reduce the risk of dementia or cognitive impairment.   7. Kidney and Urinary Health  Association of dietary protein and dairy intakes and change in renal function: results from the population-based longitudinal Doetinchem cohort study.  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a marker of kidney function. The glomeruli in the kidneys clean the blood by filtering out waste products.  This observational study in people with normal or mildly impaired GFR found that a high consumption of low-fat dairy was linked with a slower decline in GFR.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Sex differences in the effect of fish oil supplementation on the adaptive response to resistance exercise training in older people: a randomized control trial.  Muscle mass decreases with age, but strength exercises help prevent this decline. Previous research suggests that taking long-chain omega-3 (LC-立3) supplements may increase the effectiveness of strength training in older women.  This randomized controlled trial in older men and women showed that taking fish oil (3 g/day) for 18 weeks improved muscle function and quality in women only, compared to taking safflower oil (3 g/day).   Vitamin C-enriched gelatin supplementation before intermittent activity augments collagen synthesis.  Gelatin is a food product made from collagen, which is a protein found in animal connective tissues — cartilage, tendons and bones.  This study in 8 healthy men found that taking gelatin and vitamin C supplements an hour before exercise increased collagen synthesis, compared to a placebo. Gelatin supplements might promote tissue repair and help prevent injury.   Dietary nitrate does not affect physical activity or outcomes in health older adults in a randomized, cross-over trial.  Previous studies suggest that nitrate may improve exercise performance in young people. Studies in older individuals are inconclusive.  This crossover trial in older individuals, 60-75 years of age, showed that the consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice did not improve exercise performance or endurance.   Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Peak Torque Differences between Vegetarian and Omnivore Endurance Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Study.  This observational study compared endurance (maximal oxygen uptake) and strength in elite vegetarian and omnivorous endurance athletes.  The study suggests that the female vegetarian athletes had greater endurance than those who were omnivorous. A similar difference was not seen among men. Also, strength did not differ between diet groups.   Leucine supplementation enhances integrative myofibrillar protein synthesis in free-living older men consuming lower- and higher-protein diets: a parallel-group crossover study.  Leucine is the only amino acid known to stimulate muscle protein synthesis . For this reason, adequate leucine intake may reduce the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging.  This crossover study in 20 healthy, older men showed that adding 5 grams of leucine to meals three times a day improved muscle protein synthesis at rest and after strength exercise, compared to a placebo.   Efficacy and Safety of Leucine Supplementation in the Elderly.  Leucine is an amino acid found in protein-rich foods, especially in whey protein. Research indicates it may promote muscle growth and maintenance. For this reason, it is a popular supplement.  This review concluded that leucine supplements appear safe. However, the evidence is limited and further studies need to examine the effects of high doses in older people and those with specific health problems.   Vitamin D and Physical Function in Sedentary Older Men.  This randomized controlled trial in sedentary, older men found that taking vitamin D (cholecalciferol) supplements, 4,000 IU daily for 9 months, did not affect physical performance or the number of falls.   9. Oral Health  Dietary Fiber Intake Is Inversely Associated with Periodontal Disease among US Adults.  Periodontal disease is a condition characterized by swollen and bleeding gums.  This observational study showed that a high intake of dietary fiber is associated with a reduced risk of periodontal disease among US adults under 30 years old.   10. Infections and Immune Health  High-Dose Monthly Vitamin D for Prevention of Acute Respiratory Infection in Older Long-Term Care Residents: A Randomized Clinical Trial.  This study among older people in long-term care showed that supplementing with 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 monthly reduced the frequency of acute respiratory infections, such as pneumonia or the common cold.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (December 9th–16th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 16, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   A diet rich in healthy fats may be as effective for weight loss as a diet high in healthy carbs.  Impulsivity may partly explain why some people are obese.  Chlorogenic acid may be largely responsible for coffee’s benefits for heart health.  Sleep deprivation seems to increase appetite and food reward.  Chewing gum reduces appetite and snack intake.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of recent papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Lung Health  Muscles and Physical Performance    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Visceral adiposity and metabolic syndrome after very high-fat and low-fat isocaloric diets: a randomized controlled trial.  This three-month, randomized controlled trial in 46 overweight or obese men compared the metabolic effects of a very high-fat, low-carb diet to a low-fat, high-carb diet emphasizing low-processed, low-glycemic foods.  The diets had similar effects on metabolic factors. They equally reduced waist circumference, body fat and body weight. Both diets also improved the blood lipid profile and blood sugar control.   Vitamin D and Weight Cycling: Impact on Injury, Illness, and Inflammation in Collegiate Wrestlers.  This small observational study in 19 college wrestlers showed that vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency was linked to a higher fat mass.  The study didn’t detect any significant links between vitamin D levels and the frequency of illness, injury or skin infections.   A multimodal study of impulsivity and body weight: Integrating behavioral, cognitive, and neuroimaging approaches.  Impulsivity refers to people’s tendency to act without forethought.  This observational study in 45 men found that high body mass index was associated with greater impulsivity, as measured by questionnaires, behavioral tests and brain scans.   Rate of eating in early life is positively associated with current and later BMI among young Japanese children: the Osaka Maternal and Child Health Study.  This observational study in Japanese toddlers between the ages of two and three found that those who ate quickly had a significantly greater body mass index a year later.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Dose-Response Relationship between Dietary Magnesium Intake and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that adequate magnesium intake may reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 8–16%, compared to those with the lowest magnesium intake.  However, a dose-response relationship was only found among US women. Specifically, the risk of death was reduced by 24–25% for each 100 mg of magnesium per day.   Dietary tartary buckwheat intake attenuates insulin resistance and improves lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial.  Tartary buckwheat (TB) is a type of pseudocereal . It’s used similarly to a cereal, but it doesn’t belong to the grass family. TB is relatively rich in protein, fiber and antioxidants.  This four-week, randomized controlled trial in 165 people with type 2 diabetes showed that the daily consumption of buckwheat reduced fasting insulin, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.   Beneficial Effects of Pterocarpan-High Soybean Leaf Extract on Metabolic Syndrome in Overweight and Obese Korean Subjects: Randomized Controlled Trial.  Soybean leaves (SL) are a dietary supplement rich in pterocarpans (PTs). PTs are plant compounds with antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties.  This 12-week, controlled trial in overweight and obese Korean people showed that a daily intake of SL, each containing 2 grams of PTs, reduced insulin resistance and improved blood sugar control and the blood lipid profile.   3. Heart Health  Mediation of coffee-induced improvements in human vascular function by chlorogenic acids and its metabolites: two randomized, controlled, crossover intervention trials.  Previous studies show that coffee improves the function of blood vessels, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.  Two randomized controlled studies in healthy men confirmed these findings. They also showed that chlorogenic acid , one of main antioxidant plant compounds in coffee, is responsible for these effects.   Influence of the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on the cardiometabolic risk in peri and menopausal women. The Flamenco Project.  This observational study in menopausal women showed that the Mediterranean diet improved blood lipid levels and reduced the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP).  These changes may potentially reduce the risk of heart disease.   4. Cancer  Plasma Riboflavin Level is Associated with Risk, Relapse, and Survival of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.  Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is an essential nutrient. Deficiency in riboflavin may increase the risk of chronic diseases, such as cancer.  This observational study showed that low circulating riboflavin levels are associated with an increased risk of cancer in the esophagus, specifically esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .   The Interaction between Dietary Fiber and Fat and Risk of Colorectal Cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative.  This observational study in women suggests that a high dietary fiber intake modestly reduces the risk of colon cancer.  The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA were also associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. However, the protective effects of EPA and DHA were reduced when fiber intake was high.   Review of the mechanisms of probiotic actions in the prevention of colorectal cancer.  This review concluded that regular intake of probiotics might reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.  However, more studies are needed to find out what types of bacteria are most effective, as well as the optimal dosage and frequency of intake.   5. Appetite and Eating  The effects of partial sleep restriction and altered sleep timing on appetite and food reward.  This small, randomized crossover study in 18 adults suggests that partial sleep deprivation increases appetite and food rewards, potentially increasing the risk of weight gain and obesity.  However, the increases in appetite did not correspond to increases in calorie intake during a test meal.   Short-term effects of a green coffee extract-, Garcinia c ambogia- and l -carnitine-containing chewing gum on snack intake and appetite regulation.  This crossover study examined the effects of chewing gum on appetite and snack intake. Two types of gum were tested: 1) plain chewing gum and 2) gum that contained Garcinia cambogia , green coffee extract and L-carnitine.  Both types of gum reduced appetite and low-fat, sweet snack intake, compared to no gum. In addition, the enriched gum reduced high-fat, sweet snack intake and total calorie intake.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Dietary B Vitamins and a 10-Year Risk of Dementia in Older Persons.  Previous studies have provided conflicting evidence on the link between folate and dementia. This observational study in older French people showed that a high folate intake was linked to a reduced risk of dementia.   Randomized Prospective Double-Blind Studies to Evaluate the Cognitive Effects of Inositol-Stabilized Arginine Silicate in Healthy Physically Active Adults.  Arginine is an amino acid that may promote the formation of nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes the blood vessels and causes them to dilate. This improves blood flow.  This study examined the health effects of inositol-stabilized arginine silicate (ASI), a supplement designed to increase levels of arginine and nitric oxide. It showed that taking 1,500 mg of ASI per day improved mental function.   7. Eyes and Vision  Fish Consumption and Age-Related Macular Degeneration Incidence: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review of Prospective Cohort Studies.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease of the eyes and major cause of vision loss in people over 50.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies showed that regular fish consumption may reduce the risk of early AMD by 17% and late AMD by 24%. Controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.   8. Lung Health  The link between soda intake and asthma: science points to the high-fructose corn syrup, not the preservatives: a commentary.  Recent studies indicate that a high intake of sugary soda is associated with an increased risk of asthma. The researchers speculated that sodium benzoate, a common preservative in soft drinks, might be responsible.  However, other researchers who reviewed the evidence came up with an alternative suggestion. They concluded that excess, unbound fructose, which is found in high-fructose corn syrup, is a more likely cause.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Habituation to low or high protein intake does not modulate basal or postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates: a randomized trial.  The maintenance of muscle mass is largely dependent on the rate of muscle protein synthesis (MPS). MPS is elevated after a high-protein meal.  This controlled trial in older men suggests that sticking to a low or high-protein diet for 14 days doesn’t change fasting MPS. MPS was also not affected after ingesting 25 grams of protein.   A Pilot Study Examining the Effects of 8-Week Whey Protein versus Whey Protein Plus Creatine Supplementation on Body Composition and Performance Variables in Resistance-Trained Women.  Whey protein and creatine are among the world’s most popular bodybuilding supplements.  This controlled trial in 17 strength-trained women showed that supplementing with 24 grams of whey protein and 5 grams of creatine per day for two months did not increase muscle growth more than whey protein alone.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (December 2nd–9th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 9, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Sleep deprivation promotes increased calorie intake.  Eating almonds may promote greater weight loss during a calorie-reduced diet.  Fructose may promote heart failure among people with type 2 diabetes.  Taking probiotic supplements may reduce the risk of infection during a period of high-intensity training.  Bilberries lower fasting blood sugar levels and improve the blood lipid profile.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Brain and Mental Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Infections and Immune Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Women’s Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  The effects of partial sleep deprivation on energy balance: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of human intervention studies concluded that partial sleep deprivation leads to increased calorie intake without any changes in calorie expenditure or metabolic rate.  As a result, getting inadequate sleep may lead to weight gain over time.   A randomized trial of an acceptance-based behavioral intervention for weight loss in people with high internal disinhibition.  Internal disinhibition (ID) is a psychological concept referring to when people eat in response to their internal feelings. For instance, emotional eating is a form of ID.  This 2-year weight loss trial in people with ID showed that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which teaches mindfulness skills that help people control their emotions, led to greater weight loss than standard behavioral treatment.   Infection and antibiotic use in infancy and risk of childhood obesity: a longitudinal birth cohort study.  Previous observational studies indicate that antibiotic use during infancy may increase the risk of excessive fat gain and obesity. This prospective observational study followed 260,556 individuals from birth up to 18 years of age.  The study showed that antibiotic use was not linked to an increased risk of childhood obesity. However, infection in infancy without antibiotic use was linked to an increased risk.   Almond Consumption during Energy Restriction Lowers Truncal Fat and Blood Pressure in Compliant Overweight or Obese Adults.  This randomized controlled trial in 86 healthy adults with BMIs ranging from 25–40 investigated the effectiveness of consuming 15% of calories from almonds while on a calorie-reduced diet for three months.  The study showed that eating almonds led to a greater reduction in body fat and blood pressure than a nut-free diet.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Serum selenium level and gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Gestational diabetes (GD) is when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes become resistant to the effects of insulin. As in other types of diabetes, GD leads to excessively high blood sugar levels.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that women with high circulating levels of selenium are at a lower risk of GD than those with lower levels.   3. Heart Health  Adherence to the “Mediterranean Diet” in Spain and Its Relationship with Cardiovascular Risk (DIMERICA Study).  Numerous studies have linked the Mediterranean diet to a reduced risk of many chronic diseases. It is a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, olive oil, seafood and fish.  This observational study showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was linked to a lower risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.   Diabetic Cardiomyopathy: The Case for a Role of Fructose in Disease Etiology.  Fructose is a type of sugar that makes up 50% of table sugar (sucrose) and typically 55% of high fructose corn syrup. For this reason, most people in developed countries consume fructose in unnaturally high amounts.  This review concluded that excessive dietary fructose may be directly associated with heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes. However, further studies are needed to fully understand its role.   Effects of Hazelnut Consumption on Blood Lipids and Body Weight: A Systematic Review and Bayesian Meta-Analysis.  Hazelnuts, which are rich in antioxidants and monounsaturated fat, have been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that eating 29-69 grams of hazelnuts per day significantly reduced LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol. However, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and body mass index remained unchanged.   Intake of bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) reduced cardiovascular diseases risk factors through positive influences in lipoprotein profiles.  Bilberries are related to blueberries. Previous studies suggest that bilberries may reduce the risk of several chronic diseases.  This randomized controlled trial in 36 adults showed that eating 150 grams of frozen bilberries three times per week for six weeks reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar. They also increased HDL cholesterol.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Effects of Two-Year Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid Supplementation on Depressive Symptoms and Quality of Life in Older Adults with Elevated Homocysteine Concentrations: Additional Results from the B-PROOF Study, an RCT.  This randomized controlled trial in 2,919 older adults with high circulating levels of homocysteine found that taking 500 µg of vitamin B12 and 400 µg of folic acid daily for two years did not reduce depressive symptoms.   5. Kidney and Urinary Health  Effect of Cranberry Capsules on Bacteriuria Plus Pyuria Among Older Women in Nursing Homes. A Randomized Controlled Trial.  High levels of bacteria and pus, which are indicators of a urinary infection, are sometimes detected in the urine of older women in nursing homes.  This randomized controlled trial in 185 older women showed that taking two cranberry capsules, each containing 36 mg of proanthocyanidins , every day for one year had no effects on the number of bacteria or the amount of pus in their urine.   6. Bone Health  Dietary patterns explaining differences in bone mineral density and hip structure in the elderly: the Rotterdam Study.  This observational study showed that high intakes of fruits, vegetables and dairy products were linked to high bone mineral density and a low risk of bone fractures.  In contrast, dietary patterns characterized by high intakes of animal fat and/or candy, or low meat intake, were linked to a higher risk of bone fractures.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  The effect of six days of dietary nitrate supplementation on performance in trained CrossFit athletes.  Previous studies suggest that dietary nitrate may improve maximum power during exercise. Power is similar to strength, but it also takes speed or “explosive force” into consideration.  This randomized controlled trial in male CrossFit athletes showed that taking potassium nitrate supplements increased maximum power during an anaerobic test. However, it didn’t affect endurance or strength.   8. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Dietary Weight Loss, Exercise, and Oxidative Stress in Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  Oxidative stress is when levels of oxidants are high relative to levels of antioxidants. Over time, oxidative stress may cause damage to the body and increase the risk of chronic disease.  This randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women found that dietary weight loss, with or without exercise, reduced several markers of oxidative stress. These included oxidized low-density lipoprotein and F2- isoprostanes .   9. Infections and Immune Health  Probiotic Supplements Beneficially Affect Tryptophan–Kynurenine Metabolism and Reduce the Incidence of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Trained Athletes: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Trial.  A long period of intense exercise may suppress immune function and increase the risk of infection.  This randomized controlled trial in trained athletes showed that taking multi-strain probiotic supplements once a day during three months of exhaustive training reduced the risk of upper respiratory tract infections.   10. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Higher serum phenylalanine concentration is associated with more rapid telomere shortening in men.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands that protect them from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate their shortening, possibly contributing to aging.  This prospective observational study in 812 elderly Finnish people showed that high circulating levels of phenylalanine , an amino acid found in proteins, were associated with faster telomere shortening.   A prospective study of water intake and subsequent risk of all-cause mortality in a national cohort.  This prospective observational study examined the association of water intake and the risk of death from all causes over a period of 11.4 years, on average.  The study suggests that total water intake is not significantly associated with death. However, high water intake was linked to a slightly higher risk of death among women. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.   11. Women’s Health  Dairy intake and fecundability in 2 preconception cohort studies.  Animal studies indicate that galactose , a component of milk sugar released during digestion, may be toxic to the ovaries.  However, this observational study in Danish women showed that high dairy intake didn’t affect their chances of becoming pregnant. Additionally, low intake of high-fat dairy had no effects on fertility.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (November 25th–December 2nd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 2, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Adequate zinc intake may reduce the risk of heart disease among those at a higher risk.  Taking whey protein supplements may significantly reduce blood pressure in people with mildly elevated blood pressure.  Taking vitamin D supplements (calcitriol) may reduce blood pressure among people with hypertension.  Eating well-done meat is more strongly linked to colon cancer than rare meat.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Liver Health  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Depressive symptoms and obesity: instrumental variable analysis using mother–offspring pairs in the 1970 British Cohort Study.  Previous studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of depression, but the direction of causality is unknown.  This observational study found a similar association, concluding that depression makes people more likely to overeat and gain weight. In contrast, the study does not support the idea that obesity causes depression.   Effect of weekly physical activity frequency on weight loss in healthy overweight and obese women attending a weight loss program: a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in overweight and obese women suggests that longer and fewer exercise sessions are more effective for weight loss than more frequent, shorter sessions.   Chronic Low-Calorie Sweetener Use and Risk of Abdominal Obesity among Older Adults: A Cohort Study.  This observational study found that those who consumed the most low-calorie sweeteners were more likely to be overweight or obese.  This could mean that people trying to lose weight are more likely to choose low-calorie options. The findings also suggest that low-calorie sweeteners may not be an effective weight loss solution on their own.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Resveratrol as Add-on Therapy in Subjects With Well-Controlled Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  Resveratrol is an antioxidant found in plant foods, such as the skin of red grapes and blueberries. It’s best known for being found in red wine and is believed to be responsible for some of its health benefits. However, the evidence is limited.  This small controlled trial in people with type 2 diabetes showed that taking 150 mg of resveratrol supplements per day for one month did not improve insulin sensitivity. However, it tended to reduce blood pressure.   3. Heart Health  Sugar Industry and Coronary Heart Disease Research.  This historical analysis concluded that the role of sucrose (table sugar) may have been downplayed during the earliest studies on the association between diet and heart disease.  The findings indicate that the sugar industry may have sponsored major studies in the 1960s and 1970s, possibly influencing the studies’ overall conclusions.   L-Arginine and B vitamins improve endothelial function in subjects with mild to moderate blood pressure elevation.  The inner lining of the blood vessels is called endothelium. When the endothelium is dysfunctional, the blood vessels are either too narrow or too dilated. Narrow blood vessels increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.  This controlled trial showed that taking the supplement Telcor® Arginin plus, which contains arginine, vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid, improved endothelial function and lowered blood pressure, compared to a placebo.   Zinc Status and Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus—A Systematic Review of Prospective Cohort Studies.  This systematic review of observational studies concluded that high zinc intake is linked to a reduced risk of heart disease in vulnerable populations, such as those with type 2 diabetes.  On the other hand, studies have not found any associations between zinc intake or circulating zinc levels and type 2 diabetes.   Whey protein lowers blood pressure and improves endothelial function and lipid biomarkers in adults with prehypertension and mild hypertension: results from the chronic Whey2Go randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in adults with mildly elevated blood pressure showed that taking 28 grams of whey protein supplements twice a day for two months significantly reduced blood pressure, compared to a placebo.  Supplementing with either whey protein or casein (calcium caseinate) also improved endothelial function and the blood lipid profile, compared to a placebo. Only whey protein reduced triglyceride levels.   A systematic review of the effect of yogurt consumption on chronic diseases risk markers in adults.  This was a systematic review of studies examining the health effects of yogurt containing the bacteria Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (LBST).  The review concluded that LBST yogurt may have either favorable or neutral effects on health markers, compared to a placebo. Two studies out of seven found that the yogurt improved the blood lipid profile.   Total red meat intake of ≥0.5 servings/d does not negatively influence cardiovascular disease risk factors: a systemically searched meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Observational studies investigating the association between red meat intake and heart disease have provided inconsistent findings.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that red meat intake does not significantly affect blood pressure or blood lipids, compared to a placebo.   Intake of individual saturated fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease in US men and women: two prospective longitudinal cohort studies.  This large, prospective, observational study showed that a high intake of saturated fatty acids, including lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid, is highly associated with an increased risk of heart disease.  The researchers found similar associations when individual fatty acids were looked at separately.   Effect of Calcitriol Supplementation on Blood Pressure in Older Adults.  Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D. Previous studies indicate that vitamin D may play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure.  This randomized controlled trial in older adults with high blood pressure showed that taking 1,000 IU of calcitriol supplements daily for six weeks significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, compared to a placebo.   Polyphenol intake and cardiovascular risk factors in a population with type 2 diabetes: The TOSCA.IT study.  Polyphenols are a large and diverse group of antioxidants found in plants.  This observational study in people with type 2 diabetes found that a high intake of polyphenols is linked to improved risk markers for heart disease, a more favorable blood lipid profile and lower blood pressure.   4. Cancer  Meat intake, cooking methods and doneness and risk of colorectal tumours in the Spanish multicase-control study (MCC-Spain).  This observational study in Spanish people showed that a high intake of white meat, red meat and processed meat was linked to an increased risk of colon cancer.  However, the meat consumers who preferred rare-cooked meat were at the lowest risk of colon cancer, whereas grilled and barbecued meat was linked to an increased risk.   5. Appetite and Eating  Providing choice and/or variety during a meal: Impact on vegetable liking and intake.  Many people, especially children, don’t like vegetables. This study suggests that providing a variety of vegetables and giving people a selection to choose from increases vegetable liking and intake.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Fish consumption and risk of stroke: a second prospective case-control study from northern Sweden.  Previous studies indicate that high fish consumption is associated with a reduced risk of stroke.  This observational study from northern Sweden found no significant association between fish intake and stroke risk. However, high intake of lean fish was linked to an increased risk of stroke in men.   7. Eyes and Vision  Mediterranean Diet Score and Its Association with Age-Related Macular Degeneration.  The macula is the central part of the eye’s retina. Macular degeneration is one of the most common age-related eye diseases and may lead to visual impairments and blindness.  This observational study showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of age-related macular degeneration.   8. Liver Health  Vitamin D is Not Associated With Severity in NAFLD: Results of a Paired Clinical and Gene Expression Profile Analysis.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis.  Previous studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency in the development of NAFLD. However, this observational study showed that deficiency is not associated with NAFLD severity.   9. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Coffee and oxidative stress: a human intervention study.  Coffee is rich in antioxidant plant compounds. This randomized controlled trial in 160 healthy people showed that drinking 3–5 cups of coffee per day for two months did not affect circulating markers of oxidation, compared to water.  In addition, coffee did not significantly affect blood pressure, inflammatory markers, blood sugar, insulin or blood lipids.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (November 18th–25th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 25, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   A high intake of medium-chain fatty acids may promote weight loss.  Birth by cesarean section seems to increase a child’s risk of becoming obese.  Regularly eating walnuts may improve mood in men.  Taking magnesium supplements may reduce depression in magnesium-deficient, depressed people.  Drinking tea may reduce the risk of mental impairment in elderly people.  Chondroitin sulfate is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis and Joint Health  Metabolic Rate  Infections and Immune Health  Inflammation  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    Obesity and Weight Loss  Lifestyle correlates of overweight in adults: a hierarchical approach (the SPOTLIGHT project).  This observational study in 5,295 adults concluded that one of the most important lifestyle factors associated with overweight is spending lots of time sitting in front of the TV.  Other associated factors included short sleep, low vegetable intake, low physical activity and former smoking.   The effects of proteins and medium-chain fatty acids from milk on body composition, insulin sensitivity and blood pressure in abdominally obese adults.  This three-month, randomized controlled trial in 52 obese adults investigated the health effects of whey protein and butter enriched with medium-chain fatty acids.  The study showed that medium-chain fatty acids caused a significant increase in lean mass and a decrease in fat mass. The diets did not affect insulin sensitivity, blood pressure or cholesterol levels.   Cesarean Birth and Risk of Obesity in Offspring.  Children who are born by cesarean section are not exposed to the same bacteria as children who are delivered vaginally. For this reason, their gut bacteria partially differ.  This observational study showed that children born by cesarean section were more likely to gain weight and become obese. The causal relationship is unclear and needs to be studied further.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effect of Soy in Men With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Subclinical Hypogonadism – A Randomized Controlled Study.  Soy isoflavones are flavonoids that resemble the female sex hormone estrogen. For this reason, some researchers are concerned that soy products may have adverse effects in men with low testosterone levels, such as those with type 2 diabetes (T2D).  This controlled trial in men with T2D examined the effects of taking 66 mg of isoflavones every day for three months. Isoflavones improved heart disease markers and blood sugar control, and they didn’t seem to have any adverse effects.   Differential Effects of Red Meat/Refined Grain Diet and Dairy/Chicken/Nuts/Whole Grain Diet on Glucose, Insulin and Triglyceride in a Randomized Crossover Study.  This randomized controlled trial compared the health effects of two different, single meals after a month on a standardized (matched) diet.  The study showed that a meal based on red meat and refined grains led to a greater rise in blood sugar and insulin than a meal based on chicken, dairy, whole grains and nuts.   Heart Health  Individual Omega-9 Monounsaturated Fatty Acids and Mortality – The Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study.  This observational study found that high levels of omega-9 fatty acids in red blood cells — oleic acid, gondoic acid and nervonic acid — were associated with an increased risk of death from heart disease.   Kefir drink causes a significant yet similar improvement in serum lipid profile, compared with low-fat milk, in a dairy-rich diet in overweight or obese premenopausal women: A randomized controlled trial.  Kefir is a fermented milk drink originating from the Caucasus Mountains. It is fermented with a unique blend of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts.  This randomized controlled trial in obese women showed that consuming kefir improved blood lipids, compared to the control. A similar effect was achieved with an equal amount of non-fermented, low-fat milk.   Appetite and Eating  No effect of 24 h severe energy restriction on appetite regulation and ad libitum energy intake in overweight and obese males.  This trial showed that following a 24-hour, calorie-reduced diet that provided only 25% of calorie requirements did not lead to a compensatory increase in calorie intake or appetite in the following couple of days.   Brain and Mental Health  Effects of Walnut Consumption on Mood in Young Adults—A Randomized Controlled Trial.   Walnuts are rich in nutrients and antioxidant plant compounds that may protect neurons. These include vitamin E, melatonin, folate, omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols.  This randomized crossover trial in 64 healthy college students showed that eating walnuts every day for two months significantly improved the Total Mood Disturbance score in men. No significant effects were detected in women.   The Effect of Magnesium Supplementation on Depression Status in Depressed Patients with Magnesium Deficiency: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.  This randomized controlled trial in magnesium-deficient people with depression showed that taking 250 mg of magnesium supplements (magnesium oxide) for two months significantly reduced the symptoms of depression.   Meta-Analysis of the Association between Tea Intake and the Risk of Cognitive Disorders.  This meta-analysis of observational studies found that a high intake of tea was linked to a reduced risk of mental impairment in elderly, Chinese people.   Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and childhood physical and cognitive development of children: a systematic review.  Obesity among pregnant women is generally linked to adverse birth outcomes. This observational study showed that obesity before pregnancy was associated with impaired mental development in the child.   Muscles and Physical Performance  Associations of Milk Consumption and Vitamin B2 and Β12 Derived from Milk with Fitness, Anthropometric and Biochemical Indices in Children. The Healthy Growth Study.  This observational study in Greek children aged 9–13 years found that high milk consumption was associated with better performance during an endurance run test and lower body mass index (BMI).  Intakes of vitamin B2 and B12 from milk were also linked to improved fitness, indicating that they may contribute to these benefits. However, further studies are needed before firm conclusions can be reached.   Arthritis and Joint Health  Chondroitin sulfate efficacy versus celecoxib on knee osteoarthritis structural changes using magnetic resonance imaging: a 2-year multicentre exploratory study.  Chondroitin sulfate is a dietary supplement used to treat osteoarthritis (OA). However, its effectiveness is debated.  This two-year, randomized controlled trial showed that taking 1,200 mg per day of chondroitin sulfate reduced the loss of cartilage in the knee joint significantly more than taking 200 mg per day of celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat OA.   Metabolic Rate  The Energy Content and Composition of Meals Consumed after an Overnight Fast and Their Effects on Diet Induced Thermogenesis: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analyses and Meta-Regressions.  Eating food causes a temporary increase in the amount of calories burned. This boost is known as diet-induced thermogenesis or the thermic effect of food (TEF). The extent of the TEF depends on the food.  This systematic review concluded that meals high in protein or carbs caused a greater TEF than meals high in fat. It also showed that certain types of fat, such as medium-chain triglycerides, caused a greater TEF than long-chain triglycerides.   Infections and Immune Health  Effects of perioperative supplementation with pro-/synbiotics on clinical outcomes in surgical patients: A meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Probiotics are friendly bacteria that provide health benefits when consumed, whereas prebiotics are fermentable fibers that improve probitoic growth in the digestive tract. Synbiotics are a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that taking synbiotics or probiotics before and after surgery reduced the risk of infections, as well as the time patients have to stay in hospital. It also improved digestive health.   Vitamin D supplementation for preventing infections in children under five.  This Cochrane review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that taking vitamin D supplements does not reduce the risk of infections, such as pneumonia or diarrhea, in children under five years of age.   Inflammation  Plasma Levels of Marine n-3 Fatty Acids Are Inversely Correlated With Proinflammatory Markers sTNFR1 and IL-6 in Renal Transplant Recipients.  Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce inflammation in the body. This observational study confirmed previous findings.  It showed that circulating levels of omega-3 fatty acids were associated with lower levels of the inflammatory markers sTNFR1 and IL-6 in patients who recently had a renal transplant.   Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Inorganic Nitrate Supplementation in Young and Old Obese Adults Does Not Affect Acute Glucose and Insulin Responses but Lowers Oxidative Stress.  Nitric oxide is an important signaling molecule that may have several health benefits. Inorganic nitrate, which is found in leafy greens, is partly converted into nitric oxide in the body.  This randomized controlled study in obese people showed that taking nitrate supplements reduced oxidative stress in elderly individuals when blood sugar levels were high. However, similar effects were not detected in young participants.   Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  A High Protein Diet Has No Harmful Effects: A One-Year Crossover Study in Resistance-Trained Males.  Some doctors are concerned that a high-protein diet may have harmful effects in the long term.  This randomized, crossover trial in strength-trained men showed that following a high-protein diet (1.4 g/pound/day) for several months did not adversely affect blood lipids and liver or kidney function.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (November 11th–18th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 18, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Increased appetite is one main reason why weight loss maintenance is difficult.  Exposure to famine in childhood is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in middle-age.  Eating resistant starch reduces fasting insulin levels.  High whole milk intake is linked to a greater risk of death from prostate cancer.  Taking fish or krill oil supplements reduces the symptoms of dry eye disease.  Eating eggs significantly improves the absorption of vitamin E from leafy greens, when included in the same meal.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Muscles and Physical Performance  Inflammation  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Diet Quality    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  How Strongly Does Appetite Counter Weight Loss? Quantification of the Feedback Control of Human Energy Intake.  This 52-week controlled trial showed that weight loss results in a proportional increase in appetite. The researchers evaluated that this leads to an increase in calorie intake that equals 100 calories for every 2.2 pounds (1 kg) of lost weight.  The study suggests that increased appetite and calorie intake is a major reason why the long-term maintenance of weight loss is difficult.   From Kindergarten Through Second Grade, U.S. Children’s Obesity Prevalence Grows Only During Summer Vacations.  This observational study in 18,170 kindergarten children from the US showed that their risk of obesity was significantly higher when they were out of school than when there were in school.   Dietary Intake of Protein in Early Childhood Is Associated with Growth Trajectories between 1 and 9 Years of Age.  This observational study in children showed that higher protein intake during the first year of life was linked to greater increases in height, weight and BMI up to nine years of age.   Substitution Models of Water for Other Beverages, and the Incidence of Obesity and Weight Gain in the SUN Cohort.  This observational study showed that replacing one serving of sugar-sweetened beverage or beer with one serving of water per day was linked to a lower risk of obesity.  Replacing beer with water was also associated with greater weight loss.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  The role of dietary fat in obesity-induced insulin resistance.  Studies in both humans and animals show that consuming excess amounts of calories may lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.  This study in mice showed that overfeeding on a high-fat or low-fat diet resulted in similar levels of obesity. However, the high-fat diet led to greater insulin resistance. This needs to be confirmed in human studies.   Exposure to the Chinese Famine in Childhood Increases Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Adults.  This observational study in 7,801 Chinese adults showed that those who were exposed to the Chinese Famine of 1959–1961 were more likely to have type 2 diabetes than those who weren’t exposed to famine in childhood.  Those who experienced severe famine in childhood were 38% more likely to be diabetic, compared to those exposed to a less severe famine. The association was stronger in women than men.   Resistant Starch Bagels Reduce Fasting and Postprandial Insulin in Adults at Risk of Type 2 Diabetes.  Resistant starch (RS) is a type of dietary fiber. Previous studies show that RS may improve blood sugar control.  This randomized controlled trial in adults at risk of type 2 diabetes examined the effects of adding RS to bagels. It showed that eating bagels with RS significantly reduced fasting insulin levels, as well as insulin levels after meals.   3. Heart Health  Association between excessive BMI increase during puberty and risk of cardiovascular mortality in adult men: a population-based cohort study.  This prospective observational study in 37,672 Swedish men showed that gaining excessive weight during puberty increased the risk of dying from heart disease during adulthood.   Cocoa Flavanol Intake and Biomarkers for Cardiometabolic Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  Cocoa consumption has been linked to improved heart health. This effect is believed to be explained by its high antioxidant flavanol content. However, controlled trials have provided mixed results.  This meta-analysis of controlled trials indicates cocoa flavanol intake improves certain heart disease risk markers among adults. However, long-term trials are needed to examine if cocoa intake reduces diabetes or heart disease risk.   Flavanone Intake Is Inversely Associated with Risk of Incident Ischemic Stroke in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study.  Flavonoids are a class of antioxidants found in plant foods, such as fruits and vegetables. This observational study showed that high consumption of flavanones , a subclass of flavonoids, was linked to a reduced risk of stroke.  In contrast, total intake of flavonoids or other subclasses of flavonoids were not significantly linked to the risk of stroke.   A Whole-Grain Diet Reduces Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Overweight and Obese Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  Numerous studies have linked high whole grain intake with various health benefits, such as a reduced risk of heart disease. This is because whole grains are high in fiber and antioxidants.  This controlled trial in obese adults found that following a diet high in whole grains for two months significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure, compared to a diet high in refined grains. No differences were seen in other heart disease risk factors.   Meta-Analysis of Potassium Intake and the Risk of Stroke.  Potassium is an essential dietary mineral. Previous observational studies suggest that high potassium intake may reduce the risk of stroke.  This meta-analysis confirmed these findings. It concluded that consuming 3,500 mg of potassium per day was linked to the lowest risk of stroke.   4. Cancer  Dairy products intake and cancer mortality risk: a meta-analysis of 11 population-based cohort studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that total intake of dairy products did not significantly affect the risk of death from cancer.  However, high intake of whole milk was significantly associated with an increased risk of death from prostate cancer in men.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Does Body Mass Index Modify Memory, Reasoning, and Speed of Processing Training Effects in Older Adults.  This observational study in older adults found that memory, reasoning and processing speed did not differ by body mass index.  However, obese participants were 38% less responsive to memory training than normal-weight individuals.   6. Eyes and Vision  A Randomized, Double-Masked, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial of Two Forms of Omega-3 Supplements for Treating Dry Eye Disease.  Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a condition marked by insufficient tear production. This makes the eyes feel itchy and irritated.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing daily with either 945 mg of krill oil or 1,000 mg of fish oil for 90 days reduced the symptoms of DES. Both oils are rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  β-alanine supplementation to improve exercise capacity and performance: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Beta-alanine is an amino acid that has been linked with improved endurance and reduced fatigue. For this reason, it is sold as a sports supplement.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that taking beta-alanine supplements may improve exercise capacity and performance. Taking it with sodium bicarbonate appeared to be most effective.   8. Inflammation  Daily Cholecalciferol Supplementation during Pregnancy Alters Markers of Regulatory Immunity, Inflammation, and Clinical Outcomes in a Randomized Controlled Trial.  Vitamin D deficiency is very common among pregnant women. This randomized controlled trial examined the health effects of taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy.  The study showed supplementing with 2,000 IU of vitamin D per day improved immune function more than supplementing with 400 IU of vitamin D per day did. It reduced the risk of adverse conditions caused by excessive inflammation.   9. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Egg Consumption Increases Vitamin E Absorption from Co-Consumed Raw Mixed Vegetables in Healthy Young Men.Many Americans are low in vitamin E, which is found in many plant foods, such as leafy greens.  This randomized crossover study showed that eating whole eggs with a mixed vegetable salad increased the absorption of vitamin E, compared to eating vegetables alone.   10. Diet Quality  Drinking Water Intake Is Associated with Higher Diet Quality among French Adults.  This observational study in French adults found that those who consumed the most water were more likely to eat healthy.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (November 4th–11th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 11, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Monounsaturated fat is more weight loss friendly than polyunsaturated fat.  Genetics determine how well people do on high-carb, low-fat weight loss diets.  Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) effectively increases insulin sensitivity.  Long-chain omega-3 supplements reduce the risk of retinopathy (eye disease) in diabetics.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Digestive Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Macronutrient Intake-Associated FGF21 Genotype Modifies Effects of Weight-Loss Diets on 2-Year Changes of Central Adiposity and Body Composition: The POUNDS Lost Trial.  Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone involved in energy balance and fat tissue metabolism. Not everyone has the same type of FGF21.  This controlled weight loss trial showed that those with the C type of FGF21 lost significantly less fat mass than others during a low-carb, high-fat diet. However, C-type individuals lost much more fat on a high-carb, low-fat diet.   Less-than-expected weight loss in normal-weight women undergoing caloric restriction and exercise is accompanied by preservation of fat-free mass and metabolic adaptations.  This was a randomized controlled trial in women who followed a calorie-reduced diet and exercise program for three months. During the program, they lost less weight than would have been expected from calorie restriction alone.  Their weight loss was almost exclusively due to loss of fat mass. In contrast, they managed to maintain their muscle mass.   Girls picky eating in childhood is associated with normal weight status from ages 5 to 15 y.  This observational study found that girls who were picky eaters from ages 5–15 were less likely to be overweight as adolescents.   Effects of canola and high-oleic-acid canola oils on abdominal fat mass in individuals with central obesity.  This randomized, crossover study in overweight people showed that a four-week, calorie-reduced diet containing canola oil caused a greater loss of belly fat than a diet containing linseed or safflower oils.  The decrease in belly fat was linked to reduced blood pressure and triglyceride levels after the canola diet. These findings indicate that monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleic acid, are more effective for weight loss than polyunsaturated fatty acids.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Changes in Overall Diet Quality and Subsequent Type 2 Diabetes Risk: Three U.S. Prospective Cohorts.  This four-year, observational study evaluated the effects of changes in dietary quality on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Dietary quality was calculated using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).  The study showed that improvements in dietary quality were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas decreased dietary quality was linked to a higher risk.   Conjugated Linoleic Acid and Metformin on Insulin Sensitivity in obese children: Randomized Clinical Trial.  Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a naturally-occurring, trans fatty acid found in dairy fat. This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of CLA or metformin, a common drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, on insulin sensitivity in obese children.  The study showed that CLA significantly increased insulin sensitivity, compared to a placebo. However, its effects were not significantly different from those of metformin.   3. Heart Health  Randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of hesperidin 2S on validated cardiovascular biomarkers in healthy overweight individuals.  Hesperidin is a flavonoid antioxidant found in citrus fruits. This six-week, randomized controlled trial in healthy, overweight individuals found that taking 450 mg of hesperidin supplements daily did not affect blood vessel function (BVF), on average.  However, for those with poor BVF, hesperidin intake had significant benefits after a high-fat meal, compared to a placebo.   Association between Polyphenol Intake and Hypertension in Adults and Older Adults: A Population-Based Study in Brazil.  Polyphenols are a large group of antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables and other plant foods.  This observational study in Brazilian adults showed that high intake of some classes of polyphenols was linked to a lower risk of hypertension.   Effects of green tea catechin extract on serum lipids in postmenopausal women: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.  Green tea is rich in catechins , a class of flavonoid antioxidants. They have been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.  This 12-month, controlled trial in 936 postmenopausal women showed that taking 1,315 mg of catechin supplements four times daily significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides, especially among those with high levels.   4. Cancer  Urinary Cadmium and Breast Cancer: A Prospective Danish Cohort Study.  Cadmium is a heavy metal that has been associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Additionally, recent studies indicate it may affect hormone-related cancers.  However, this observational study found no significant links between cadmium levels in urine and the risk of developing breast cancer after menopause.   5. Appetite and Eating  The Effect of a 20 km Run on Appetite Regulation in Long Distance Runners.  This study in well-trained, long-distance runners showed that a 12.4 mile (20 km) run decreased calorie intake at a subsequent meal, as well as levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin, compared to those who didn’t run.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Is Hypovitaminosis D Associated with Stress Perception in the Elderly? A Nationwide Representative Study in Korea.  Anxiety and low levels of vitamin D are common among older people in Korea. This observational study showed that inadequate levels of vitamin D were associated with greater anxiety in older, Korean women.   A randomized placebo controlled trial of vitamin B12 supplementation to prevent cognitive decline in cognitively normal older diabetic people with borderline low serum vitamin B12.  Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with cognitive decline in older age. However, this randomized controlled trial showed that taking vitamin B12 supplements did not prevent cognitive decline in older people with mild vitamin B12 deficiency.   Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of choline supplementation in school-aged children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  Heavy alcohol consumption during early pregnancy may cause impairments in mental and behavioral development in the child, a condition known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).  This randomized controlled trial in school-aged children with FAS showed that taking 625 mg of choline supplements per day for six weeks did not improve cognitive performance, compared to a placebo.   7. Eyes and Vision  Dietary Marine ω-3 Fatty Acids and Incident Sight-Threatening Retinopathy in Middle-Aged and Older Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes. Prospective Investigation From the PREDIMED Trial.  Retinopathy is an eye disease that results in sight impairment or blindness. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is when the blood vessels in the retina are damaged by high blood sugar levels.  This observational study in middle-aged and older diabetics showed that taking at least 500 mg of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids daily reduced the risk of DR and its severity.   8. Digestive Health  Diet as a Trigger or Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a collective term for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, both of which are conditions caused by severe inflammation in the digestive tract.  This review discussed the potential triggers of IBD. These include low intake of fruits and vegetables and high intake of animal fat, emulsifiers in processed foods and FODMAPs . In contrast, vitamin D and curcumin may improve treatment.   Administration of a Multi-Strain Probiotic Product to Women in the Perinatal Period Differentially Affects the Breast Milk Cytokine Profile and May Have Beneficial Effects on Neonatal Gastrointestinal Functional Symptoms. A Randomized Clinical Trial.  This randomized controlled trial showed that when pregnant women took a multi-strain probiotic supplement daily during late pregnancy, the cytokine content of their breast milk changed. Cytokines are molecules that act similarly to hormones.  This also appeared to have beneficial effects on immune function in their newborns and potentially reduced the risk of adverse digestive symptoms.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  “A Vegetarian vs. Conventional Hypocaloric Diet: The Effect on Physical Fitness in Response to Aerobic Exercise in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.” A Parallel Randomized Study.  This randomized controlled trial showed that a vegetarian, calorie-reduced diet improved physical fitness more than a conventional, calorie-reduced diet among people with type 2 diabetes following an aerobic exercise program.   10. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Diet quality and telomere length in older Australian men and women.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands that protect them from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate their shortening, possibly contributing to aging.  This observational study in older, Australian people estimated diet quality using the Dietary Guideline Index, Recommended Food Score and Mediterranean Diet Score. It found that diet quality was not associated with longer telomeres.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (October 28th–November 4th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 4, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   High expectations may increase weight loss success.  Taking folic acid supplements reduces the risk of stroke among people with high cholesterol and blood pressure levels.  Eating moderate amounts of chocolate is associated with a lower risk of heart failure.  Eating chocolate is linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.  Shift work may increase anxiety and hunger in the following day.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Eyes and Vision  Digestive Health  Muscles and Physical Performance    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  The Influence of Weight-Loss Expectations on Weight Loss and of Weight-Loss Satisfaction on Weight Maintenance in Severe Obesity.  This randomized controlled trial in 88 severely obese individuals showed that having high expectations of success during a weight loss program led to greater weight loss.  Additionally, those who were satisfied with the amount of weight they lost were more likely to be able to maintain their weight afterwards.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Higher Levels of Magnesium and Lower Levels of Calcium in Whole Blood Are Positively Correlated with the Metabolic Syndrome in a Chinese Population: A Case-Control Study.  This observational study in Chinese adults showed that low circulating levels of calcium and high levels of magnesium were associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Habitual chocolate intake and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study: (1975–2010): Prospective observations.  This observational study in 953 adults showed that high chocolate consumption was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.  Those who never ate chocolate were 91% more likely to develop diabetes than those who ate chocolate more than once per week.   4. Heart Health  Folic Acid Therapy Reduces the First Stroke Risk Associated With Hypercholesterolemia Among Hypertensive Patients.  This randomized controlled trial in 20,702 adults with high blood pressure examined the effects of taking an 0.8 mg-folic acid supplement with 10 mg of enalapril daily, or enalapril alone. Enalapril is a drug used to treat hypertension and heart failure.  The study found that taking folic acid supplements reduced the risk of stroke by 31% among people with high cholesterol levels. In contrast, taking folic acid did not significantly affect stroke risk in those with low cholesterol levels.   Chocolate Intake and Incidence of Heart Failure: Findings from the Cohort of Swedish Men.  This prospective observational study in 31,917 healthy men found a J-shaped association between chocolate intake and heart failure.  In other words, eating moderate amounts of chocolate reduced the risk of heart failure, compared to eating no chocolate. However, if the intake exceeded one serving per day, chocolate did not affect heart failure risk.   Effect of soy on metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors: a randomized controlled trial.  This three-month, randomized controlled trial showed that eating 30 grams of soy protein per day reduced body weight by 1.5% and significantly improved the blood lipid profile, compared to an equal amount of animal protein.  These findings indicate that soy protein may reduce the risk of heart disease.   The effect of coffee intake on lysophosphatidylcholines: a targeted metabolomic approach.  Having high circulating levels of oxidized LDL-cholesterol (oLDL-C) is a risk factor for heart disease. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPC) are a component of oLDL-C.  This observational study in Brazilian adults found that those who consumed high amounts of coffee, or more than 100 ml per day, had significantly lower levels of LysoPC than those who didn’t drink any coffee at all.   Dietary fat and carbohydrate quality have independent effects on postprandial glucose and lipid responses.  This randomized crossover trial in 20 healthy Chinese men showed that eating a meal containing 40 grams of olive oil temporarily increased circulating triglyceride levels, compared to meals containing butter or grape seed oil.  The health relevance of these changes is unclear.   Calcium Intake From Diet and Supplements and the Risk of Coronary Artery Calcification and its Progression Among Older Adults: 10-Year Follow-up of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).  This observational study in older adults found high intakes of calcium were linked to a reduced risk of atherosclerosis , which is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Calcium from food, rather than supplements, was especially protective.  In contrast, a high intake of calcium supplements was associated with a higher risk of coronary artery calcification, which is a risk factor for heart disease.   5. Cancer  A Western Dietary Pattern Increases Prostate Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies showed that the Western dietary pattern, as well as high-carb diets, was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.  In contrast, “health diets” were not significantly linked to the risk of prostate cancer.   6. Appetite and Eating  The association between anxiety, hunger, the enjoyment of eating foods and the satiety after food intake in individuals working a night shift compared with after taking a nocturnal sleep: A prospective and observational study.  This observational study in 34 male shiftworkers showed that they were hungrier and more anxious before lunch in the days following a night shift, compared to days following a night of sleep.   Hormonal responses to non-nutritive sweeteners in water and diet soda.  Previous observational studies have linked the consumption of calorie-free sweeteners with impaired metabolism. However, this randomized crossover study found that sucralose did not affect any metabolic factors.  In contrast, drinking 355 ml of a diet soda containing 18–41 mg of acesulfame potassium increased levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) after eating sugar, without affecting appetite or stomach emptying.   7. Eyes and Vision  Dietary glycemic index and retinal microvasculature in adults: a cross-sectional study.  The retina is a light-sensitive layer of cells in the eyeball. A dense network of tiny blood vessels, known as the retinal microvasculature (RM), supplies the retina with oxygen and nutrients.  This observational study in adults showed that the RM was significantly less dense among those who ate a lot of foods that caused large spikes in blood sugar levels, compared to those that ate less sugary foods.   The Association between the Lipids Levels in Blood and Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that is a major cause of vision loss and blindness among Americans. The risk of AMD increases with age.  This meta-analysis of observational studies found that high levels of HDL cholesterol were linked to an increased risk of AMD. In contrast, high levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol were associated with a lower risk.   8. Digestive Health  Carbohydrate and protein intake and risk of ulcerative colitis: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation and small sores (ulcers) in the lining of the colon. The main symptom of active disease is bloody diarrhea.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that dietary carb or protein intake was not significantly linked to the risk of UC. However, high sucrose (table sugar) intake was associated with an increased risk.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Serum folate predicts muscle strength: a pilot cross-sectional study of the association between serum vitamin levels and muscle strength and gait measures in patients >65 years old with diabetes mellitus in a primary care setting.  This observational study in 56 older patients with type 2 diabetes showed that high circulating levels of folate were significantly associated with greater grip and leg strength. Greater leg strength was linked to a reduced risk of falling.   Acute effects of caffeine-containing energy drinks on physical performance: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Caffeine is a stimulant found in coffee, green tea and energy drinks. It is widely used to enhance physical performance in sports. Energy drinks also contain other potential performance enhancers, such as taurine .  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that drinking caffeinated energy drinks improves sports performance, strength and endurance. However, the improvement in performance was linked to the dosage of taurine.   Time of Day and Training Status Both Impact the Efficacy of Caffeine for Short Duration Cycling Performance.  This study examined the effects of taking caffeine supplements on cycling performance at different times of the day.  It found that trained athletes were more likely to benefit from caffeine supplements in the morning, compared to the evening. However, the benefits of caffeine in the evening were greater among untrained individuals.   Associations between exclusive breastfeeding and physical fitness during childhood.  This observational study in children showed that exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life was linked to slightly improved physical fitness at ages 6–11.   Does Human Milk Modulate Body Composition in Late Preterm Infants at Term-Corrected Age?  This observational study showed that feeding late preterm infants human milk was linked to higher fat-free mass, including muscle mass.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (October 21st–28th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 28, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Calcium supplements may promote weight loss in some people.  Eating a low-carb meal for breakfast does not impair blood sugar control at lunch.  An iron-fortified diet may significantly reduce blood levels of lead, a toxic heavy metal.  A high intake of energy drinks was linked to a higher risk of anxiety and suicides in Korean adolescents.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Contaminants and Food Safety  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Body composition changes after very low-calorie-ketogenic diet in obesity evaluated by three standardized methods.  Loss of muscle mass is common on low-calorie diets. This study examined changes in body composition in 20 obese people who followed a very low-calorie, ketogenic diet for four months.  During the weight loss program, the participants lost an average of 44 pounds (20 kg), mainly fat mass and water weight. In contrast, the researchers detected no significant changes in muscle mass.   Effects of calcium supplementation on body weight: a meta-analysis.  It’s unclear whether calcium supplements affect body weight. This is because studies have provided inconsistent results.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that taking calcium supplements may reduce body weight in children, adolescents, adult men and premenopausal women, as well as those with normal body weight.   Ultraprocessed food consumption and risk of overweight and obesity: the University of Navarra Follow-Up (SUN) cohort study.  This observational study in 8,451 middle-aged Spanish university graduates showed that the consumption of “ultra-processed” food products was linked to a higher risk of overweight and obesity.   Dietary energy density and obesity: how consumption patterns differ by body weight status.  Calorie density, also known as energy density, refers to how many calories one gram of a specific food provides. Energy-dense foods include those that are high in fat and low in water and fiber.  This observational study in 9,551 adults showed that eating foods with low calorie density was associated with lower body mass index and waist circumference.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Acute effects of a single dose of tocotrienols on insulinemic and inflammatory responses in metabolic syndrome subjects after a high-fat challenge.  Previous studies indicate that tocotrienols — a form of vitamin E — may beneficially affect disorders associated with metabolic syndrome (MS).  This randomized controlled trial in adults with MS showed that 200–400 mg of tocotrienol, eaten with a milk shake and high-fat muffin, did not affect blood sugar control or inflammatory or thrombogenic markers, compared to a placebo.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effect of carbohydrate restriction in the first meal after an overnight fast on glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes: a randomized trial.  People with type 2 diabetes are sometimes advised to consume equal amounts of carbs at all meals. This is because eating a high-carb meal after a period of carb restriction or fasting has been shown to cause high spikes in blood sugar levels.  However, this study did not support this recommendation. Eating a low-carb breakfast after an overnight fast did not affect blood sugar response at lunch, compared to eating a high-carb breakfast.   4. Heart Health  Maternal Vitamin D Status at Week 30 of Gestation and Offspring Cardio-Metabolic Health at 20 Years: A Prospective Cohort Study over Two Decades.  This prospective observational study found no significant association of circulating vitamin D levels in women who were 30-weeks pregnant and markers of metabolic health and heart disease in the child at age 20.   Fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular risk factors in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.  This observational study followed individuals who were recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for over five years.  It found that high intakes of fruits and vegetables were associated with higher circulating levels of vitamin C and improved risk factors for heart disease, such as lower waist circumference and elevated levels of HDL cholesterol.   Dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, and refined carbohydrates are associated with risk of stroke: a prospective cohort study in urban Chinese women.  The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of the extent to which foods raise blood sugar levels. The glycemic load (GL) is another measure based on the GI. Unlike the GI, GL takes the amount of food eaten into account.  This observational study in middle-aged and older Chinese women showed that a high dietary GI and GL intake, mainly due to high intake of refined grains, was associated with an increased risk of stroke.   Maternal plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid levels during pregnancy and childhood lipids and insulin levels.  This observational study in pregnant women found that higher circulating levels of omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were associated with higher levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and insulin in the child.   Adiposity during adolescence and carotid intima-media thickness in adulthood: Results from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort.  Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is a risk factor for heart disease. Specifically, it refers to the thickness of the two innermost layers of artery walls.  This observational study showed that when adolescents have large amounts of skin fat and a high body mass index when they are 11 or 15 years old, their cIMT is greater at 18 years of age.   Short term effects of palm-tocotrienol and palm-carotenes on vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk: A randomised controlled trial.  Seed oils such as palm oil are the richest dietary sources of tocotrienols, which are a form of vitamin E. Unprocessed palm oil is also rich in carotenes, which are antioxidants like vitamin E.  This 8-week, randomized controlled trial in 90 adults with type 2 diabetes showed that taking 21 mg per day of carotenes or 420 mg per day of tocotrienols did not affect blood vessel function or heart disease risk factors.   5. Cancer  Plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D and subsequent prostate cancer risk in a nested Case-Control study in Japan: The JPHC study.  This observational study in Japanese men showed that circulating levels of vitamin D were not significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer.  However, there was a slight association between high levels of vitamin D and advanced prostate cancer.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Association between energy drink intake, sleep, stress, and suicidality in Korean adolescents: energy drink use in isolation or in combination with junk food consumption.  This observational study in Korean adolescents found that a high intake of energy drinks was linked to greater stress, sleep dissatisfaction, bad mood and an increased risk of suicides. The direction of causality is unclear.   7. Liver Health  Isocaloric Diets High in Animal or Plant Protein Reduce Liver fat and Inflammation in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.  This prospective observational study in adults with type 2 diabetes showed that high-protein diets were significantly associated with less liver fat, independently of body weight. Markers of insulin resistance were also reduced.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Probiotic Streptococcus thermophilus FP4 and Bifidobacterium breve BR03 Supplementation Attenuates Performance and Range-of-Motion Decrements Following Muscle Damaging Exercise.  Probiotics are friendly bacteria that provide health benefits when consumed. Two such probiotics are Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) and Bifidobacterium breve (BB).  This study in men examined the effects of supplementing with ST and BB daily for three weeks before a strength-exercise session. The authors speculated that the probiotics reduced muscle tension and loss of performance due to muscle damage.   9. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Vitamin D Deficiency Increases the Risk of Adverse Neonatal Outcomes in Gestational Diabetes.  This observational study in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes showed that vitamin D deficiency was linked to a major increase in the risk of small birth weight and low blood sugar levels in the infant.   A vegetable, fruit, and white rice dietary pattern during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of preterm birth and larger birth size in a multiethnic Asian cohort: the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study.  This observational study in pregnant Asian women investigated the effects of three dietary patterns on birth outcomes: 1) vegetables, fruits and white rice, 2) seafood and noodles and 3) pasta, cheese and processed meat.  The study found that a high intake of vegetables, fruit and white rice was linked to a lower risk of preterm birth and larger birth size when compared to the other dietary patterns.   10. Contaminants and Food Safety  Effects of wheat-flour biscuits fortified with iron and EDTA, alone and in combination, on blood lead concentration, iron status, and cognition in children: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.  Lead is a heavy metal that is toxic to neurons. The absorption of lead may be increased in those who are iron deficient.  This randomized controlled trial in lead-exposed children examined the effects of increased iron intake on circulating lead levels. The study showed that an iron-fortified diet significantly reduced lead levels, compared to a placebo.   11. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Effect of phytase on zinc absorption from a millet-based porridge fed to young Burkinabe children.  Phytic acid (phytate) is an antinutrient that reduces the absorption of minerals, including zinc, from the same meal. This study in children investigated the effectiveness of adding a phytate-degrading enzyme (PDE) to a cereal porridge.  The study showed that absorption of zinc increased from 10% to 16% with the addition of PDE.   Food groups associated with measured net acid excretion in community-dwelling older adults.  Acid-producing diets have been linked to an increased risk of disease. The impact of dietary acid load can be measured in urine.  This study in older adults showed that a high fruit intake was associated with a lower dietary acid load (DAL), whereas grains were linked to a higher DAL. In contrast, proteins and vegetables were not significantly linked to DAL.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (October 14th–21st)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 21, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Chromium-enriched bread improves blood sugar control.  High cadmium levels are linked to an increased risk of depression in the elderly.  Eating soy foods may reduce the risk of depression during pregnancy.  Fermented garlic extract may improve liver health.  Resveratrol supplements reduce testosterone levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Liver Health  Arthritis  Inflammation  Pain  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Women’s Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Regularly consuming a green/roasted coffee blend reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome.  Green coffee is richer in antioxidants than roasted coffee. This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of drinking three servings of green or roasted coffee per day on body fat, blood sugar control, blood lipids and blood pressure.  Body fat and blood pressure decreased in both groups, compared to the control. Regardless of the type of coffee, blood sugar control and triglyceride levels also improved. These effects were stronger among those with high cholesterol levels.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Controlling type-2 diabetes by inclusion of Cr-enriched yeast bread in the daily dietary pattern: a randomized clinical trial.  Previous studies in healthy people have shown that eating whole wheat bread enriched with chromium (CEB) may reduce the spike in blood sugar levels after meals, compared to regular whole wheat bread.  This controlled study in people with type 2 diabetes showed that eating CEB for three months improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and HbA1c levels, compared to regular bread. Additionally, it caused weight loss and lower blood pressure.   Soluble fibers from psyllium improve glycemic response and body weight among diabetes type 2 patients (randomized control trial).  Psyllium husk is a type of fiber made from the seed covering of psyllium plants. It is rich in soluble fiber.  This randomized controlled trial in 40 adults with type 2 diabetes found that taking 10.5 grams of psyllium supplements daily for two months significantly improved insulin resistance, fasting blood sugar, insulin, HbA1c levels and body mass index.   3. Cancer  The Association between Dietary Vitamin A and Carotenes and the Risk of Primary Liver Cancer: A Case–Control Study.  This observational study of a group of Chinese adults, which consisted of healthy people and patients with primary liver cancer, showed that high intakes of vitamin A, retinol and carotenes from food was linked to a lower risk of primary liver cancer.   Dietary glycemic index, glycemic load and cancer: an overview of the literature.  The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of the extent to which foods raise blood sugar levels. The glycemic load (GL) is another measure based on the GI. Although unlike the GI, GL takes the amount of food eaten into account.  This meta-analysis concluded that eating a lot of foods with a high GI is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. On the other hand, a high GL was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and endometrial cancer.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Associations of Blood Cadmium Levels With Depression and Lower Handgrip Strength in a Community-Dwelling Elderly Population: A Repeated-Measures Panel Study.  Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal. Sources of cadmium include tobacco smoke, airborne dust and some grains and vegetables.  This observational study in 983 elderly people showed that high circulating levels of cadmium were linked to lower handgrip strength and an increased risk of mental depression.   Soy isoflavone intake and prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy in Japan: baseline data from the Kyushu Okinawa Maternal and Child Health Study.  Soybeans and soy products are rich in isoflavones, a class of plant compounds found in legumes.  This observational study in 1,745 Japanese women found that high intakes of soy products, such as tofu and miso, was linked to a reduced risk of depression during pregnancy.   5. Digestive Health  Probiotics and Prevention of Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Kids.  This review concluded that taking a probiotic supplement during antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children and adolescents aged one month to 18. The researchers considered the evidence to be moderate quality.   Does chewing gum after a caesarean section lead to quicker recovery of bowel function?  A caesarean section (CS) may cause the bowels to stop working for several hours or days. The condition usually resolves on its own.  This Cochrane review and meta-analysis concluded that chewing gum in the first 24 hours after a CS may speed the recovery of bowel function. However, the researchers considered the evidence to be of low quality.   Colon Hypersensitivity to Distension, Rather Than Excessive Gas Production, Produces Carbohydrate-related Symptoms in Individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition associated with bowel discomfort, cramps and irregular bowel movements. Studies indicate that fermentable fiber, such as FODMAPs , may be to blame.  This study showed that people with or without IBS responded similarly to eating fermentable fiber, such as inulin. Gas formation was similar in both groups. The authors suggested that people with IBS may be hypersensitive to bowel distention.   6. Liver Health  Association between rice, bread, and noodle intake and the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Japanese middle-aged men and women.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to cirrhosis .  This observational study in middle-aged, Japanese adults found that a high consumption of rice and other high-carb foods was linked to an increased risk of NAFLD in women, but not in men.   Efficacy and safety of fermented garlic extract on hepatic function in adults with elevated serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  This was a randomized controlled trial in 75 adults with mildly-elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), which is a marker of liver disease.  The study showed that taking fermented garlic extract (FGE) supplements for three months significantly reduced levels of GGT, as well as other markers of liver disease. These findings suggest that FGE may improve liver health.   7. Arthritis  Adherence to a mediterranean diet is associated with lower prevalence of osteoarthritis: Data from the osteoarthritis initiative.  Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints. The main symptoms are joint swelling, stiffness and pain.  This observational study in 4,358 men and women showed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduced risk of knee osteoarthritis.   8. Inflammation  Effects of inulin-type fructans, galacto-oligosaccharides and related synbiotics on inflammatory markers in adult patients with overweight or obesity: a systematic review.  This systematic review concluded that taking prebiotic fiber supplements — inulin or galacto-oligosaccharides — may reduce inflammatory markers in overweight or obese adults.   Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on antioxidant capacity and inflammation in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after surgery: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) is an antioxidant that plays an important role in the body’s energy generation and antioxidant defenses. Dietary sources include liver, meat, fish, parsley and broccoli.  This randomized controlled study in patients who had undergone surgery for liver cancer showed that taking 300 mg of a Q10 supplement daily for three months increased antioxidant capacity, reduced oxidative stress and decreased inflammation.   9. Pain  Selenium and Zinc Status in Chronic Myofascial Pain: Serum and Erythrocyte Concentrations and Food Intake.  Chronic myofascial pain (CMP) is a pain disorder. It’s characterized by aching pain in muscles, usually occurring in distinct, isolated areas.  This observational study showed that CMP was associated with low body stores of zinc and selenium, as well as inadequate dietary intake of these minerals.   10. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Association between Maternal Zinc Status, Dietary Zinc Intake and Pregnancy Complications: A Systematic Review.  Adequate body zinc stores or dietary intake of zinc is very important during periods of growth, such as during pregnancy.  However, this review of observational studies showed that zinc status was not significantly associated with complications during pregnancy, such as spontaneous preterm birth, preeclampsia , low birth weight or diabetes.   11. Women’s Health  Effects of Resveratrol on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial.  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition in women, characterized by cysts on the ovaries and high levels of testosterone. Previous studies suggest that resveratrol, an antioxidant found in many plant foods, may possibly help.  This randomized controlled trial in women with PCOS showed that taking 1,500 mg of resveratrol supplements daily for three months reduced total testosterone by 23%, fasting insulin by 32% and increased insulin sensitivity by 66%.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (October 7th–14th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 14, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Observational evidence suggests that environmental pollutants might promote obesity.  Carotenoid antioxidants — lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin — may reduce the symptoms of ulcerative colitis.  Regularly going to bed late and sleeping in is linked with higher body weight.  Taking folic acid supplements may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Contaminants and Food Safety  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Mediterranean diet and mortality risk in metabolically healthy obese and metabolically unhealthy obese phenotypes.  This was an observational study in obese people who were either metabolically healthy or metabolically unhealthy. Those who were metabolically unhealthy had metabolic syndrome or some of its symptoms.  The study showed that adhering to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduced risk of death among those who were metabolically healthy, but not among those who were unhealthy.   Evening chronotype associates with obesity in severely obese subjects: interaction with CLOCK 3111T/C.  People can be divided into morning or evening types, depending on their sleeping habits. Those who are morning types tend to go to sleep early and wake up early the next day. In contrast, evening types go to sleep late and tend to sleep in.  This observational study showed that obese morning types lost more weight than evening types after weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). Morning types also had lower initial body weights.   Do environmental pollutants increase obesity risk in humans?  This systematic review of observational studies concluded that exposure to environmental pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, may increase the risk of obesity by disrupting the endocrine system. However, long-term studies are needed.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Dietary protein from different food sources, incident metabolic syndrome and changes in its components: an 11-year longitudinal study in healthy community-dwelling adults.  This prospective observational study followed 5,324 healthy adults for 11 years. It found that a higher intake of plant proteins was linked to a lower risk of metabolic syndrome.  Each 5% increase in animal protein intake was associated with elevated blood pressure, weight gain and a 0.97 cm-increase in waist circumference.   3. Heart Health  Efficacy of Folic Acid Therapy on the Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease.  This randomized controlled trial in 15,104 Chinese adults with hypertension examined whether taking 0.8 mg of a folic acid supplement per day for several years slowed the decline of kidney function.  The study showed that taking folic acid with a blood pressure-lowering drug called enalapril delayed the progression of chronic kidney disease significantly more than enalapril alone.   A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of supplementation with Nigella sativa (black seed) on blood pressure.  Nigella seeds have a peppery taste and are used as a spice. They are commonly used in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that taking nigella seed supplements in powder or oil form can significantly reduce blood pressure. However, the long-term effects are still unclear.   Vegetarian diet reduces the risk of hypertension independent of abdominal obesity and inflammation: a prospective study.  This prospective observational study in Taiwanese adults showed that vegetarians were less likely than omnivores to suffer from abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension).  Specifically, they had a 34% lower risk of developing hypertension than non-vegetarians.   4. Appetite and Eating  Acute post-exercise energy and macronutrient intake in lean and obese youth: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that intense exercise temporarily reduced food intake among obese children. In contrast, no significant effects were seen in lean children or adolescents.   Metabolic, endocrine and appetite-related responses to acute and daily milk snack consumption in healthy, adolescent males.  This randomized crossover study examined the temporary and long-term effects of daily milk consumption on adolescent men. It then compared the effects to those of fruit juice.  The researchers discovered that drinking milk for 28 days reduced calorie intake at a test meal. Long-term consumption of milk also improved blood sugar control.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for children with specific learning disorders.  This Cochrane review and meta-analysis concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to claim that eating polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as long-chain omega-3s, improves the learning abilities of children with learning disorders.   6. Digestive Health  Lycopene, Lutein and Zeaxanthin May Reduce Faecal Blood, Mucus and Pus but not Abdominal Pain in Individuals with Ulcerative Colitis.  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation and small sores (ulcers) in the lining of the colon. The main symptom of active disease is bloody diarrhea.  This observational study of people in UC remission found that a higher intake of certain carotenoids — lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin — was linked with less mucus, blood and pus in feces, although it didn’t reduce abdominal pain.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Both basal and post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates, following the ingestion of a leucine-enriched whey protein supplement, are not impaired in sarcopenic older males.  Leucine is an amino acid used in protein synthesis. It is considered one of the most important amino acids for muscle building. Supplementing with leucine is especially beneficial for older people with age-related muscle wasting (sarcopenia).  This study showed that taking 21 grams of a leucine-enriched whey protein supplement increased the rate of muscle protein synthesis in both healthy and sarcopenic older men.   8. Pregnancy and Infant Health  High cholesterol dietary intake during pregnancy is associated with large for gestational age in a sample of low-income women of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.   This observational study showed that high cholesterol intake during pregnancy was linked with a larger birth weight.   Vitamin A supplementation for infants one to six months of age for preventing death and illnesses.  This Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that there is no convincing evidence that vitamin A supplements reduce the risk of death or illness in infants.   9. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Sodium Intake and All-Cause Mortality Over 20 Years in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention.  The association of sodium intake and health is controversial. This observational study found that a high sodium intake was associated with a higher risk of premature death.   10. Contaminants and Food Safety  Reaching Nutritional Adequacy Does Not Necessarily Increase Exposure to Food Contaminants: Evidence from a Whole-Diet Modeling Approach.  Although dietary guidelines try to ensure that all nutrient requirements are met, they do not take food contaminants into account.  This study concluded that achieving nutritional adequacy might increase exposure to food contaminants, although within safe limits.   11. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  The adverse effects of an excessive folic acid intake.  Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate. Whether excessive folic acid intake adversely affects health is debated, and studies have provided conflicting results.  This review discussed the general safety of folic acid and its potential adverse effects.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (September 30th–October 7th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 7, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Corn oil seems to improve the blood lipid profile more than extra virgin olive oil.  Processed meat is linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, while fresh red meat is neutral.  Probiotics may improve the symptoms of multiple sclerosis.  Blood lead levels are associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children.  Synbiotics (probiotics plus prebiotics) may reduce slow transit constipation.  A2 milk increases levels of the antioxidant glutathione, compared to normal milk.    New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Liver Health  Arthritis  Antioxidant and Oxidative Stress  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Diets    1. Metabolic Syndrome  Adherence to the Healthy Eating Index-2010 is inversely associated with metabolic syndrome and its features among Iranian adult women.  This observational study in Iranian women found that a high score on the Healthy Eating Index -2010 was associated with a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effects of low-glycemic-index diets in pregnancy on maternal and newborn outcomes in pregnant women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  The glycemic index is a measure of the extent to which food raises blood sugar after a meal. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examined the health effects of following a low glycemic index-diet (LGI-diet) during pregnancy.  The study concluded that LGI-diets reduced fasting blood sugar levels, as well as blood sugar levels after meals. It also reduced birth weights and the risk of excessive weight gain during pregnancy. No adverse effects were detected.   Do ω-3 PUFAs affect insulin resistance in a sex-specific manner? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Previous studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids improve insulin resistance in obese people. However, their findings are mixed, and some studies indicate a gender-dependent effect.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials provided additional evidence for a gender-dependent effect. Omega-3 fatty acids seem to improve insulin resistance in women, but not men.   3. Heart Health  Corn oil intake favorably impacts lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein and lipoprotein particle levels compared with extra-virgin olive oil.  This randomized controlled, crossover trial in men and women showed that eating 54 grams of corn oil per day improved the blood lipid profile more than an equal amount of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).  Specifically, corn oil caused greater improvements in levels of total cholesterol, large LDL-C, IDL-C, VLDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B and LDL particles. In contrast, EVOO increased apo A1, but HDL-C levels did not differ between treatments.   The VITAH Trial—Vitamin D Supplementation and Cardiac Autonomic Tone in Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease on Hemodialysis: A Blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial.  Hemodialysis is a mechanical process that cleans the blood of patients with kidney disease. One of the side effects of hemodialysis is an increased risk of heart disease. Also, vitamin D deficiency leads to an added risk.  This controlled trial in patients undergoing hemodialysis as treatment for end-stage kidney disease showed that taking 50,000 IU per week of vitamin D supplements for six weeks improved heart health among those with severe vitamin D deficiency.   Potato consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease: 2 prospective cohort studies.  This observational study in 69,313 Swedish adults without heart disease or diabetes showed that potato consumption was not associated with heart disease risk.   Consumption of a flavonoid-rich acai meal is associated with acute improvements in vascular function and a reduction in total oxidative status in healthy overweight men.  Acai berries are a popular health food that’s rich in antioxidant polyphenols. This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of acai berries on blood vessel function and oxidative status in 23 healthy, overweight men.  The study showed that drinking an acai-based smoothie with a high-fat breakfast improved blood vessel function and oxidative status, compared to a control smoothie. In this way, acai berries might reduce the risk of heart disease.   4. Cancer  Fruit and Vegetables Consumption: A Pointer for Cholangiocarcinoma Prevention in Northeast Thailand, the Highest Incidence Area in the World.  Cholangiocarcinoma , or bile duct cancer, is most common in northeast Thailand and the neighboring country, Laos, where it’s usually caused by parasitic flatworms.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that high dietary intake of fruits and vegetables was linked to a reduced risk of cholangiocarcinoma.   Dietary Patterns for Women With Triple-negative Breast Cancer and Dense Breasts.  Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer. In TCBC, the cancer cells do not have any of the three receptors — estrogen, progesterone and HER2/neu receptors — commonly found in other types of breast cancer.  This observational study showed that eating seafood, vegetables, nuts and vegetable oils reduced the risk of TNBC. In contrast, eating grains, animal fat, eggs and meat was linked to an increased risk.   Prostate cancer risk related to foods, food groups, macronutrients and micronutrients derived from the UK Dietary Cohort Consortium food diaries.  Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. This observational study in middle-aged and older UK men found no significant links between prostate cancer and 37 dietary factors, estimated by food diaries.   Association Between Consumption of Red and Processed Meat and Pancreatic Cancer Risk—a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.   This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that high consumption of red and processed meat was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Clinical and metabolic response to probiotic supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease. It’s characterized by a variety of neurological symptoms, ranging from mental problems to impaired eyesight, muscle weakness and lack of coordination.  This randomized controlled trial in MS patients showed that taking one capsule of a probiotic supplement every day for three months improved mental health, inflammatory status, blood sugar control, the blood lipid profile and general function.   Blood lead concentrations and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Korean children: a hospital-based case control study.  Lead is a neurotoxic heavy metal that may cause brain disorders and damage to the nervous system. It can enter the body through food or inhaled dust.  This observational study in Korean children showed that even low blood levels of lead were significantly associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.   6. Digestive Health  Efficacy of Synbiotics in Patients with Slow Transit Constipation: A Prospective Randomized Trial.  The cause of constipation varies. Slow transit constipation (STC) is caused by the slow movement of stools through the colon and linked to poor intestinal function. Patients with severe STC often do not respond to fiber supplements or laxatives.  This randomized trial in patients with STC found that supplementing with synbiotics (probiotics plus prebiotics) for three months increased stool frequency and consistency and improved symptoms in most participants.   7. Liver Health  Effect of daily calcitriol supplementation with and without calcium on disease regression in non-alcoholic fatty liver patients following an energy-restricted diet: Randomized, controlled, double-blind trial.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells. It is often associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with NAFLD showed that taking 25 μg of calcitriol (a vitamin D supplement) for three months during a weight loss program significantly reduced fasting blood sugar levels and improved a marker of liver health.   8. Arthritis  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with better quality of life: data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.  This observational study in people with osteoarthritis found that high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly linked to reduced pain, stiffness and mental depression. It was also associated with improved quality of life.   9. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Clinical evaluation of glutathione concentrations after consumption of milk containing different subtypes of β-casein: results from a randomized, cross-over clinical trial.  Glutathione is one of the body’s main antioxidants. Previous studies indicate that milk containing A1 beta-casein (A1BC) may reduce the production of glutathione in the body, potentially promoting oxidative stress.  This randomized controlled trial found that drinking half a liter of A2 milk, which contained no A1BC, was linked to a greater increase in glutathione levels, compared to normal milk containing A1BC.   10. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Processed Meat, but Not Unprocessed Red Meat, Is Inversely Associated with Leukocyte Telomere Length in the Strong Heart Family Study.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands that protect them from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate their shortening, possibly contributing to aging.  This observational study in native Americans showed that a high consumption of processed meat was linked to shorter telomeres in white blood cells. In contrast, fresh (unprocessed) red meat was not linked to telomere length.   11. Diets  Plasma Alkylresorcinols Reflect Gluten Intake and Distinguish between Gluten-Rich and Gluten-Poor Diets in a Population at Risk of Metabolic Syndrome.  Some gluten intolerant individuals have difficulty adhering to a gluten-free diet. Therefore, testing for compliance is currently difficult.  This randomized controlled trial indicates that alkylresorcinols , a class of phenolic lipids found in gluten grains, can serve as a marker of compliance to a gluten-free diet. Their blood levels reflect the intake of cereal grains that contain gluten.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (September 23rd–30th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 30, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the main findings this week:   The ketogenic diet appears safe and effective for people with type 2 diabetes.  Consuming carotenoids (lutein or lycopene) may protect against sunburns.  Taking folic acid supplements may improve mental function in elderly people.  Licorice flavonoid oil may reduce body fat in elderly people.  Soluble dietary fiber improves recovery after colon surgery.    Research Reviews  We reviewed two articles this week. One examined the effectiveness and safety of the ketogenic diet for people with diabetes, while the other investigated whether lycopene and lutein protect the skin against harmful sunlight.   Review:  Is the Ketogenic Diet Effective and Safe for Diabetics?  Article:  Short-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of a very low-calorie-ketogenic diet interventional weight loss program versus hypocaloric diet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Summary: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the safety and effectiveness of a calorie-reduced, ketogenic diet in obese people with type 2 diabetes.  The study showed that the ketogenic diet was significantly more effective than a standard weight loss diet. It also appeared reasonably safe for people with type 2 diabetes, although most participants reported mild adverse effects.   Review:  Carotenoids Are a Natural Sunscreen.  Article:  Molecular evidence that oral supplementation with lycopene or lutein protects human skin against ultraviolet radiation: Results from a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of supplements containing lutein or a lycopene-rich tomato paste on the expression of genes that are linked to sunburns.  The findings suggest that lutein and lycopene may protect the skin against harmful ultraviolet sunlight. However, whether they slow down skin aging and reduce the risk of skin cancer is unknown.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Inflammation  Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Allergies and Autoimmune Disorders  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Contaminants and Food Safety  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  The Effects of Licorice Flavonoid Oil on Increasing Muscle Mass: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.  This randomized controlled trial in elderly Japanese people showed that taking 300 mg per day of a licorice flavonoid oil supplement for four months increased trunk muscle mass and reduced body fat percentage, compared to a placebo.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Association between serum zinc and later development of metabolic syndrome in middle – aged and older men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.  This 11-year prospective observational study in middle-aged Finnish men showed that those with the highest circulating zinc levels were at a 84% greater risk of developing metabolic syndrome, compared to those who had the lowest zinc levels.  High zinc levels were also linked to greater waist circumference, high blood pressure and lower levels of HDL cholesterol.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Does oral glutamine improve insulin sensitivity in adolescents with type 1 diabetes?  Glutamine is one of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins in the human body. In fact, it is the most abundant one. It is also found in dietary protein, such as meat and fish.  This study in adolescents with type 1 diabetes showed that taking glutamine supplements reduced blood sugar levels after exercise. In contrast, insulin sensitivity remained unchanged.   Maternal Dietary Patterns and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in a Multi-Ethnic Asian Cohort: The GUSTO Study.  This observational study in Asian women examined the associations of three different dietary patterns and the risk of gestational diabetes (GDB), which is diabetes during pregnancy.  The dietary patterns were the following: 1) a vegetable, fruit and rice-based diet, 2) a seafood noodle-based diet and a 3) a pasta, cheese and processed meat diet. Only the seafood noodle-based dietary pattern was linked to a reduced risk of GDB.   4. Heart Health  Dietary flavonoid intake and incident coronary heart disease: the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study.  Flavonoids are a diverse class of antioxidant polyphenols found in all whole plant foods. Subclasses of flavonoids include anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins.  This prospective observational study found that high anthocyanidin or proanthocyanidin intake was linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. In contrast, there was no significant association with total flavonoid intake or other subclasses.   5. Cancer  Sucralose Non-Carcinogenicity: A Review of the Scientific and Regulatory Rationale.  Food authorities consider the artificial sweetener sucralose to be non-carcinogenic, meaning that it is not associated with an increased risk of cancer.  This review of animal and human studies on sucralose supports previous conclusions. There is no evidence that sucralose causes cancer, even at doses that are much greater than normal dietary intakes.   6. Appetite and Eating  Modification of aftertaste with a menthol mouthwash reduces food wanting, liking, and ad libitum intake of potato crisps.  In this controlled study, women were given 12 minutes to eat as many potato chips as they wanted (or up to 50 grams). Every three minutes they were required to wash their mouth with either water or a menthol solution.  The menthol mouthwash significantly reduced the liking and cravings for the chips and reduced hunger and thirst, compared to no mouthwash or plain water. Further studies need to determine if this is a feasible weight loss strategy.   7. Brain and Mental Health  Vitamin D Levels and the Risk of Cognitive Decline in Chinese Elderly People: the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey.  This observational study in Chinese elderly people showed that low vitamin D levels were associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and decline.   Effects of 6-Month Folic Acid Supplementation on Cognitive Function and Blood Biomarkers in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial in China.  This randomized controlled trial in Chinese elderly people with mild mental impairment showed that taking 400 µg per day of a folic acid supplement for six months increased circulating folate and vitamin B12 levels.  Additionally, supplementation significantly improved full scale IQ, verbal working memory and spatial perception.   The Mediterranean Diet and Cognitive Function among Healthy Older Adults in a 6-Month Randomised Controlled Trial: The MedLey Study.  This randomized controlled trial in healthy older adults found that following a Mediterranean dietary pattern for half a year did not significantly improve mental function, compared to a regular diet.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Improved Function With Enhanced Protein Intake per Meal: A Pilot Study of Weight Reduction in Frail, Obese Older Adults.  This was a 6-month randomized controlled trial in obese people aged 60 years and older following a weight loss program.  It showed that those who consumed additional protein with their meals lost the same amount of weight as those who received no added protein. However, protein supplementation led to greater functional improvements.   Primary Prevention of Sexual Dysfunction With Mediterranean Diet in Type 2 Diabetes: The MEDITA Randomized Trial.  This 8-year randomized trial showed that the Mediterranean diet improved sexual function in men and women with type 2 diabetes, compared to a low-fat diet.   9. Inflammation  The Effects of Early Post-Operative Soluble Dietary Fiber Enteral Nutrition for Colon Cancer.  This was a study of patients undergoing colon surgery for cancer. It showed that those who got enteral nutrition consisting of soluble dietary fiber early after surgery recovered better, compared to those who got standard enteral nutrition.  Specifically, soluble fiber improved intestinal and immune function and reduced the inflammatory reaction to surgery.   10. Antioxidants and Oxidative Stress  Healthy Dietary Patterns and Oxidative Stress as Measured by Fluorescent Oxidation Products in Nurses’ Health Study.  Oxidative stress (OS) is a condition characterized by low amounts of antioxidants, relative to oxidants. It has been linked to various chronic diseases and inflammation. Fluorescent oxidation products (FOPs) are a marker of OS.  This observational study found that those who consumed the healthiest diet, according to the Healthy Eating Index, DASH diet and Mediterranean diet, were slightly more likely to have increased levels of FOPs.   11. Allergies and Autoimmune Disorders  Infant Allergenic Food Introduction and Risk of Allergic/Autoimmune Disease.  This meta-analysis of controlled trials and observational studies showed that early introduction of eggs or peanuts into the infant diet is linked to a reduced risk of developing an allergy to these foods later on.   12. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Prospective associations of maternal betaine status with offspring weight and body composition at birth: the GUSTO (Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes) cohort study.  Betaine (trimethylglycine) is an amino acid derivative found in many plants, including quinoa, spinach and beets.  This observational study in pregnant women showed that higher circulating levels of betaine were associated with a smaller body size in the infant. This included smaller birth weight, birth height, head circumference and less abdominal fat mass.   13. Contaminants and Food Safety  Relationships Between Urinary Phthalate Metabolite and Bisphenol A Concentrations and Vitamin D Levels in U.S. Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2005–2010.  Certain food contaminants, such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates , may disrupt the endocrine system, the glands that produce hormones and regulate the body’s metabolism. Collectively, these contaminants are known as endocrine disruptors.  This observational study showed that the levels of phthalates and BPA in urine were associated with lower circulating levels of vitamin D. However, the association between BPA and vitamin D was only significant in women.   14. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Estimation of the dietary requirement for vitamin D in adolescents aged 14-18 y: a dose-response, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled dose-response trial investigated the dietary requirements of vitamin D in white adolescents. Adolescents are at a high risk of low vitamin D status.  The researchers concluded that white adolescents need to consume between 10–30 μg of vitamin D per day, on average, to maintain adequate vitamin D levels during the wintertime at high latitudes.

	Carotenoids Are a Natural Sunscreen  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 28, 2016  Sunscreen is not only applied to your skin, your body also makes its own. It’s called melanin.  But that’s not all. Growing evidence indicates that carotenoids, the antioxidants responsible for the vivid colors of many fruits and vegetables, may provide added protection from the sun.  A recent study investigated the effects of taking carotenoid supplements — lycopene and lutein — on skin protection at the molecular level. Here is a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  Carotenoids are a diverse group of antioxidant plant compounds that are responsible for the red, orange and yellow colors of many fruits and vegetables.  Several studies show that they may protect the skin against harmful sunlight.  Beta-carotene, which can be converted to vitamin A, is the most extensively studied carotenoid. A meta-analysis of seven controlled trials concluded that taking beta-carotene supplements may protect against sunburns and reduce their severity ( 1 ).  Carotenoids other than beta-carotene may also act in a similar way.  One study showed that taking 24 grams of a mixed carotenoid supplement containing equal amounts of beta-carotene, lycopene and lutein protected the skin as much as 24 grams of beta-carotene alone ( 2 ).  Another 10-week trial found that consuming tomato paste, providing 16 mg per day of lycopene, significantly reduced sunburns, compared to a placebo ( 3 ).  However, lycopene may not be the only plant compound in tomatoes providing benefits. Taking a supplement containing a combination of plant compounds from tomatoes led to better protection against sunburns than lycopene alone ( 4 ).  Article Reviewed  This was a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of lycopene and lutein supplements on genes associated with sunburns.  Molecular evidence that oral supplementation with lycopene or lutein protects human skin against ultraviolet radiation: Results from a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.  Study Design  This randomized, double-blind crossover trial examined the capacity of the carotenoids lycopene and lutein to protect the skin against harmful sun radiation.  It was divided into two parts:  Part 1: Lycopene   A total of 29 people (25 men and 4 women) completed part 1. They were assigned to two 3-month treatment periods in a random order.   Lycopene : Every day the participants took four capsules containing a lycopene-rich tomato extract providing 5 mg of lycopene, as well as other plant compounds, such as phytoene, phytofluene, tocopherols and phytosterols.  Placebo: Capsules containing soy bean oil were taken instead of lycopene.    Part 2: Lutein  A total of 30 people (23 men and 7 women) completed the lutein arm of the study. They were assigned to two 3-month treatment periods in a random order.   Lutein : Every day the participants took two capsules containing 10 grams of lutein stabilized by 10% carnosic acid.  Placebo: Capsules containing soy bean oil were taken instead of lutein.    Before each study period, there was a 2-week washout period to reduce any possible carry-over effects from the previous period or the participants’ regular diets.  To investigate the carotenoids’ effects on the skin’s ability to protect itself against harmful light, the following procedure was conducted at the start and end of each treatment period.   The researchers started by irradiating a patch of each participant’s skin with two types of ultraviolet light — ultraviolet B (UVB/A-) and ultraviolet A (UVA1) — using a solar simulator.  24 hours later, they took a skin biopsy from the irradiated area. For comparison, they also took a biopsy from a skin area that was not exposed to ultraviolet light.  Finally, they analyzed the skin samples for the expression of genes that are associated with oxidative stress and sunburns.  These genes were heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1).   In addition, the researchers measured the carotenoid levels in the participants’ blood.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of supplements containing a lycopene-rich tomato paste or lutein on the expression of genes associated with sunburns.  Finding: Lycopene and Lutein May Protect Against Sun-Induced Skin Damage  Supplementing with lycopene or lutein significantly increased blood levels of these carotenoids.  Additionally, exposure to ultraviolet light increased the activity of genes linked to oxidative stress and sunburns (HO-1, ICAM-1 and MMP-1).  However, the researchers discovered that taking lycopene or lutein supplements reduced the activity of these genes, compared to placebo.  The findings indicate that these carotenoids may protect the skin against damage and premature aging caused by sun exposure. The protective effect was similar after both types of ultraviolet light (UVB/A-and UVA1).  It also didn’t matter if the lycopene was given in the first or second phase of each study arm.  However, the protective effect of lutein was significantly weaker, compared to lycopene, if it was given in the second phase. That is, after a placebo period.  On the other hand, there were no differences between lycopene and lutein when they were given in the first phase.  These findings are supported by controlled trials showing that lycopene may reduce sunburns, as well as the harmful effects of sunlight on the molecular level ( 3 , 5 , 6 ).  Why carotenoids work in this way is currently unknown, but some scientists believe it may have something to do with their antioxidant properties.  Bottom Line: The study found that the carotenoids lycopene and lutein may protect the skin against harmful ultraviolet sunlight.  Limitations  This study had an excellent design. However, it had one fault — the short washout periods between treatments.  The purpose of washout periods is to prevent carry-over effects from a previous treatment or the participants’ habitual diets. Their insufficient length is often a weakness of crossover trials.  In the current study, the length of the washout periods appeared to be reasonably long, based on previous studies ( 7 , 8 ).  However, the protective effects of lutein were significantly weaker when it was given after 16 weeks of a lutein-restricted diet, indicating that the washout periods might not have been long enough.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that dietary intake of lutein and lycopene may protect the skin against harmful sunlight, possibly slowing skin aging and reducing the risk of skin cancer.  Although the findings are very promising, further studies are needed before any definite health claims can be made.  Nevertheless, eating tomatoes, watermelons, bell peppers, kale or other carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables is definitely a good idea if you spend a lot of time in the sun.

	Is the Ketogenic Diet Effective and Safe for Diabetics?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 26, 2016  Although low-calorie ketogenic diets are proven to be beneficial for many people, some health professionals are concerned about their effects in diabetics.  Addressing this concern, a recent randomized controlled trial investigated the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of a 4-month, very low-calorie ketogenic diet in 89 obese people with type 2 diabetes.  Here is a detailed summary of its findings, in addition to some background information.   Background  The ketogenic diet contains minimal amounts of carbs.  This forces the body to burn fat and leads to ketosis, which is characterized by elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood. The ketone bodies partially replace glucose (blood sugar) as fuel for cells.  Reducing sugar intake has multiple health benefits , especially for diabetics.  Additionally, eating sugar, especially sugar-sweetened beverages , may promote overeating. Sugar may also be addictive for some people, making them susceptible to cravings and overeating.  For these reasons, high sugar intake is probably one of the main causes of weight gain and obesity.  A ketogenic diet eliminates most dietary sugar, as well as the health problems associated with it. However, eliminating dietary carbs means that you have to eat more fat or protein instead.  Increasing fat intake doesn’t seem to be a problem if the diet is also calorie-reduced. Studies indicate that high-fat diets are more effective for weight loss than low-fat diets. This is probably because high-fat diets contain much fewer carbs ( 1 ).  Additionally, limiting carbs is more beneficial for weight loss and blood sugar control, compared to a low-fat diet or high-carb diet ( 2 , 3 ).  Yet, some researchers are concerned that a high protein intake on a very low-carb diet may adversely affect diabetic people with kidney problems (diabetic nephropathy) ( 4 , 5 ).  Others have pointed out that very low-carb or high-protein diets may not be feasible in a real-life setting ( 6 ).  In 2008, the American Diabetes Association even concluded that very low-carb diets were of limited use for people with diabetes and should only be considered as part of a structured weight loss program ( 7 ).  However, few studies have examined the safety and effectiveness of a calorie-reduced, very low-carb ketogenic diet, compared to a standard weight loss diet.  Article Reviewed  This study examined the safety and effectiveness of a low-calorie ketogenic diet in obese diabetics.  Short-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of a very low-calorie-ketogenic diet interventional weight loss program versus hypocaloric diet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Study Design  This randomized controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of a low-calorie ketogenic diet in obese people with type 2 diabetes.  A total of 89 men and women, aged 30–65, participated in the study. They followed a 4-month weight loss program, which included lifestyle and behavioral modification support.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:  1. Very Low-Calorie, Ketogenic Diet (VLCK)  This was a commercial weight loss program (DiaproKal Method) based on specific protein supplements provided by Pronokal Protein Supplies in Spain.  The program consisted of three stages:   Active phase : Very low-calorie diet (600–800 calories per day) containing less than 50 grams of carbs from vegetables and 10 grams of olive oil. Protein intake ranged between 0.36–0.55 grams per pound of body weight (0.8–1.2 g per kg).  Metabolic stabilization : When the participants had reached a pre-specified weight loss target, they began a low-calorie diet and gradually started to incorporate different food groups.  Maintenance phase : Finally, the participants went on a weight maintenance diet that was balanced in carbs, protein and fat and ranged between 1,500–2,250 calories per day.    2. Standard Low-Calorie Diet (Control)  This was a standard weight loss diet based on the American Diabetes Association Guidelines ( 8 ).  It aimed at reducing calorie intake by 500–1,000 calories per day, depending on the participants’ basal metabolic rate.  The diet provided 10–20% of calories from protein, 45–60% from carbs and less than 30% of calories from fat.   In both groups, the participants attended nine individual support sessions with a dietitian and were contacted by telephone twice a month.  The researchers measured the participants and took blood samples on four occasions: 1) at the start of the study, 2) after 2 weeks, 3) after 2 months, and 4) at the end of the study (after 4 months).  They measured the following parameters:   Renal function : Biomarkers of kidney function were measured in blood samples.  Liver function : Biomarkers of liver function were measured in blood samples.  Ketones : Levels of ketone bodies in blood samples were measured to confirm that those in the VLCK reached ketosis.  Body weight, body mass index and waist circumference .  Blood sugar control : Fasting blood sugar, insulin and HbA1c were measured in blood samples. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).  Blood lipids : Fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.  Dietary adherence : Assessed using the Eating Self-Efficacy Scale.   Conclusion: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the safety and effectiveness of a calorie-reduced, very low-carb ketogenic diet in obese people with type 2 diabetes.  Finding 1: The Ketogenic Diet Caused Greater Weight Loss  The participants in the VLCK group lost an additional 22 lbs (10 kg) of body weight, compared to the control group.  Specifically, they lost 32 lbs (15 kg) in the VLCK group and 11 lbs (5 kg) in the control group.  They also experienced a greater decrease in waist circumference, as shown in the chart below.   Some researchers have speculated that the ketogenic diet helps people lose weight only because it’s much higher in protein than the standard weight loss diet.  Eating high amounts of protein is known to reduce appetite and increase the amount of calories burned .  One study suggests that going on a ketogenic diet without increasing protein intake has no lasting effect on the amount of calories burned and doesn’t lead to additional weight loss, compared to a standard, high-carb weight loss diet.  Conclusion: The ketogenic diet led to significantly greater weight loss than the standard low-calorie diet.  Finding 2: The Ketogenic Diet Led to Greater Improvements in Blood Sugar Control  Insulin resistance decreased significantly more in the VLCK group, compared to the control, as shown in the chart below.   Fasting blood sugar levels reduced similarly in both groups.  However, the decrease in HbA1c was significant only in the VLCK group. HbA1c is a marker of blood sugar control that represents the previous 3-month average of blood sugar levels.  These findings are supported by previous studies showing that very low-carb diets improve blood sugar control in diabetics ( 9 , 10 ).  Conclusion: The ketogenic diet significantly improved blood sugar control, compared to a standard weight loss diet.  Finding 3: Self-Reported Adverse Effects Were More Common on the Ketogenic Diet  The researchers detected no significant differences in safety parameters between groups. However, self-reported adverse effects were more common in the VLCK group.  Mild adverse effects were reported by 80% of the participants in the VLCK group but only 41% of those in the control group. These included headache, nausea, vomiting and weakness.  Additionally, constipation and low blood pressure when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) were more common in the VLCK group at the end of the study. No serious adverse effects were reported.  Adverse effects became less frequent as the study progressed. The authors concluded that the ketogenic diet is a safe, well-tolerated weight loss method for people with type 2 diabetes.  The adverse effects reported in this study are similar to those generally associated with very low-carb diets ( 11 ).  Conclusion: Blood analyses revealed no significant differences in biomarkers of liver and kidney function between groups. However, self-reported adverse effects were more common in the VLCK group.  Limitations  Participants in the VLCK group received protein supplements provided by Pronokal Protein Supplies in Spain.  Additionally, five of the nine authors received research grants and advisory board fees from the company, creating a conflict of interest.  Otherwise, the study appears to have been well designed.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In conclusion, a weight loss program based on the ketogenic diet was significantly more effective than a standard weight loss program.  It appeared safe and reasonably well tolerated by people with type 2 diabetes and caused greater weight loss and improvements in blood sugar control.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (September 16th–23rd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 23, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the main findings this week:   High-calorie, high-sugar snacks may promote weight gain.  Butter is associated with reduced diabetes risk, but has no link to heart disease.  Food fussiness may be reducing weight loss success in childhood.  Eating red and orange plant foods helps protect the eyes from harmful light.  Better dietary quality may improve children’s academic success.    Research Reviews  We reviewed two articles this week. One examined the scientific literature associating snacking with weight gain, while the other investigated whether butter intake was linked with heart disease, diabetes and mortality.   Review:  How Does Snacking Affect Your Waistline?  Article:  Snack Food, Satiety, and Weight.  Summary: This review examined the evidence linking snacking behavior with appetite and weight gain.  It concluded that those who eat high-calorie or high-sugar snacks between meals are at risk of gaining weight. However, the evidence is mostly observational.   Review:  Butter: Good or Bad?  Article:  Is Butter Back? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Butter Consumption and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Total Mortality.  Summary: This meta-analysis of observational studies examined the association between butter intake and heart disease, diabetes and death.  Butter may be neutral when it comes to heart disease, but it may slightly increase the risk of death and reduce the risk of diabetes.   New Research From Around the World  Many new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar and Diabetes  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Digestive Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Decreasing food fussiness in children with obesity leads to greater weight loss in family-based treatment.  Children are often picky eaters, rejecting foods they don’t think are tasty and avoiding unfamiliar foods.  This observational study in children showed that fussiness was linked with a low vegetable intake. It also found that reducing fussiness during a behavioral weight loss program led to greater weight loss and a healthier diet.   Lunch eating predicts weight-loss effectiveness in carriers of the common allele at PERILIPIN1: the ONTIME (Obesity, Nutrigenetics, Timing, Mediterranean) study.  Perilipin is a protein that is an important regulator of fat storage. Its levels are higher in obese humans and animals.  This observational study showed that having a certain variant of the perilipin gene (PLIN1) may impair weight loss when a lot of calories are eaten late in the day.   2. Blood Sugar and Diabetes  Effect of probiotics and synbiotics on blood glucose: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials.  Probiotics are live bacteria that provide health benefits when consumed. They should not be confused with prebiotics, which are a category of fiber that promotes their growth in the digestive tract. Synbiotics are a combination of both.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials suggests that taking probiotic or synbiotic supplements can lower fasting blood sugar levels in people with high levels to begin with.   High dietary choline and betaine intakes are associated with low insulin resistance in the Newfoundland population.  Betaine (trimethylglycine) is a compound found in plant foods like quinoa, spinach and beets. Choline is an animal-derived compound found in eggs, liver and fish roe.  This observational study showed that both betaine and choline were linked to lower insulin resistance. This association was stronger in women than men.   Do Cinnamon Supplements Have a Role in Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes? A Narrative Review.  Previous studies suggest that taking cinnamon supplements can help lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.  This literature review concluded that cinnamon supplements cause a modest decrease in blood sugar levels when taken regularly.   Dietary protein intake and risk of type 2 diabetes: results from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and a meta-analysis of prospective studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that a high intake of animal protein was linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, a high intake of plant protein was linked to a lower risk.   Effect of inulin-type fructans on blood lipid profile and glucose level: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Inulin is a type of fructan. Fructans are a class of dietary fiber made up of fructose molecules.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that taking inulin supplements may reduce LDL cholesterol. In addition, it may increase HDL cholesterol and decrease fasting insulin levels in diabetics.   3. Cancer  Plasma 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Risk of Breast Cancer in Women Followed over 20 Years.  This observational study found no overall association between circulating vitamin D levels and the risk of breast cancer. However, the results indicate that women with high vitamin D levels in the summer are at a lower risk than those with low levels.   Association between Dietary Inflammatory Index and Gastric Cancer Risk in an Italian Case-Control Study.  This observational study in 230 Italian patients showed that a pro-inflammatory diet, as assessed by the Dietary Inflammatory Index, was associated with an elevated risk of stomach cancer.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Diet quality and academic achievement: a prospective study among primary school children.  This observational study of children in grades 1–3 showed that a healthier diet, evaluated by the Baltic Sea Diet Score and the Health Eating Index, was associated with better reading skills. In contrast, arithmetic skills were not improved.   Mediterranean Diet, Cognitive Function, and Dementia: A Systematic Review of the Evidence.  Growing evidence suggests that following the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of dementia and age-related declines in mental performance.  This systematic review concluded that the Mediterranean diet is associated with better cognitive performance. However, the evidence is mostly based on observational studies, which cannot demonstrate cause and effect.   5. Eyes and Vision  Lutein and zeaxanthin supplied by red /orange foods and fruits are more closely associated with macular pigment optical density than those from green vegetables in Spanish subjects.  Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoid antioxidants that protect your eyes from harmful blue light. Green vegetables are the largest dietary sources of these.  However, this observational study suggests that the intake of red and orange plant foods is more strongly associated with the levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in the eyes.   6. Digestive Health  Dietary Factors Reduce Risk of Acute Pancreatitis in a Large Multiethnic Cohort.  Acute pancreatitis is when the pancreas suddenly becomes inflamed. Severe acute pancreatitis is a serious condition associated with a high risk of death.  This prospective observational study linked a high intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, red meat and eggs to an increased risk of gallstone-related acute pancreatitis. In contrast, a high intake of dietary fiber was linked to a reduced risk.   Probiotic administration among free-living older adults: a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.  Probiotics are live bacteria that have been proven to be beneficial to health. They are found in some fermented foods and are also taken as supplements. Lactobacillus reuteri is one of many types of probiotics.  This randomized controlled trial in people 65 years and older showed that supplementing with L. reuteri for 3 months did not lead to any significant improvements in digestive health, well-being or anxiety.   7. Bone Health  Maternal serum retinol and β-carotene concentrations and neonatal bone mineralization: results from the Southampton Womens Survey cohort.  Retinol is a form of vitamin A found in animals. Beta-carotene is found in plants, but can be changed into retinol by the body. For this reason, beta-carotene is called provitamin A.  This observational study in pregnant women showed that circulating levels of retinol were associated with smaller bone size and less growth at birth. In contrast, circulating levels of beta-carotene were linked with greater bone size and growth.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  The Effect of Dietary Nitrate Supplementation on Endurance Exercise Performance in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Previous studies suggest that taking nitrate supplements may improve exercise performance.  Overall, this systematic review and meta-analysis found no significant effects of nitrates on endurance exercise performance. However, there were some moderate effects in trials that measured the time to exhaustion.   9. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Plasma eicosapentaenoic acid is negatively associated with all-cause mortality among men and women in a population-based prospective study.  Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a long-chain omega-3 fatty acid that has been associated with various health benefits. It is mainly found in oily fish, fish oil and microalgae.  This observational study found that high circulating levels of EPA were linked with a reduced risk of premature death in Australian men and women.   Association Between Carbohydrate Nutrition and Successful Aging Over 10 Years.  This observational study in adults, aged 49 years and older, showed that a high intake of dietary fiber from whole-grain bread and cereals increased the likelihood of aging over a 10-year period without any chronic diseases.   10. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Usual nutrient intakes of US infants and toddlers generally meet or exceed Dietary Reference Intakes: findings from NHANES 2009-2012.  The latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that the nutrient intake of infants and toddlers in the US generally met or exceeded the Dietary Reference Intakes for most nutrients.  However, most were at risk for inadequate intakes of vitamins D and E, and their diets were low in fiber and potassium.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Butter: Good or Bad?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 21, 2016  For the past decades, butter has been implicated as a significant cause of heart disease.  However, studies provide mixed results and whether butter truly increases the risk of chronic disease is hotly debated.  A recent meta-analysis examined how eating butter affects heart disease, type 2 diabetes and mortality risk. Here is a detailed summary of the findings.   Background  Butter is a dairy product made from cream. It is almost pure milk fat, which mainly consists of saturated fatty acids.  The role of butter in health and disease is uncertain and hotly debated. Several studies show that a high intake of saturated fat is linked with a poor blood lipid profile, which is a risk factor for heart disease.  Additionally, one controlled trial showed that a high intake of saturated palm oil, rich in palmitic acid, caused greater gains in belly fat and liver fat, compared to polyunsaturated fat ( 1 ).  However, the largest and most recent meta-analyses of observational studies suggest that reducing saturated fat itself has neutral effects on health, whereas replacing it with certain unsaturated fats may have benefits ( 2 ).  Additionally, growing evidence suggests that not all saturated fats are the same and demonizing saturated fats as a whole is an oversimplification.  Nevertheless, official dietary guidelines continue to recommend lower intakes of all saturated fat and higher intakes of non-hydrogenated unsaturated fat ( 3 ).  Studies suggest that butter is different from other sources of dairy fat. Specifically, the fat in butter is not enclosed in a milk fat globule membrane (MFGM).  Several randomized controlled trials show that eating butter fat has worse effects on the blood lipid profile than other sources of dairy fat with an intact MFGM, such as cream or cheese ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Whether these effects translate into an elevated risk of hard endpoints, such as heart attacks, remains unclear.  Article Reviewed  This meta-analysis examined the association between butter intake and heart disease, diabetes and all-cause mortality or death.  Is Butter Back? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Butter Consumption and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Total Mortality.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies and randomized controlled trials examining the association of butter consumption with heart disease, diabetes and mortality.  The researchers searched scientific databases for all relevant studies that fulfilled the exclusion criteria. When conducting the analysis, they followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.  A total of 9 publications were selected, including a total of 636,151 participants. No randomized controlled trials with hard endpoints were found.  Bottom Line: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies investigating the association of butter with the risk of heart disease, diabetes and death.  Finding 1: Butter Was Weakly Linked With All-Cause Death  Two large observational studies assessing the links between butter consumption and all-cause mortality (death) were included in the meta-analysis. These studies included a total of 379,763 participants.  The analysis showed that the risk of death increased by 1% for each tablespoon (14 grams) of butter consumed daily.  Previous, large meta-analyses examining the effects of total saturated fat intake found no significant effects on overall mortality ( 2 , 7 ).  Bottom Line: The researchers discovered that for each tablespoon of butter eaten, the risk of death from any cause increased by 1%.  Finding 2: Butter Reduced the Risk of Diabetes  The analysis included four studies examining the links between butter consumption and type 2 diabetes. They included a total of 201,628 participants.  Pooling the findings from these studies, the researchers discovered that a higher intake of butter was linked with a modest decrease in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  Specifically, the risk of type 2 diabetes decreased by 4% for each tablespoon (14 grams) eaten daily.  Other observational studies have found no association between dairy fat and type 2 diabetes, but a few support the present results, reporting a reduced risk with higher intakes ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Bottom Line: The study showed that each tablespoon of butter eaten daily reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 4%.  Finding 3: Butter Was Not Linked With Heart Disease  Five of the included studies investigated the association of butter with heart disease.  When their results were combined, butter intake was not significantly linked with heart disease, including stroke and coronary heart disease.  These findings are supported by previous meta-analyses ( 12 , 13 ).  Bottom Line: The meta-analysis showed that butter was not significantly associated with the risk of developing heart disease.  Limitations  The main limitation of this meta-analysis was the observational design of the included studies. Observational studies cannot demonstrate causality.  Since high butter consumption is generally associated with unhealthy dietary patterns and lifestyle habits, the study might have overestimated the association of butter with mortality, and/or underestimated its links with type 2 diabetes.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This analysis suggests that butter is neutral when it comes to the risk of developing heart disease.  Additionally, it was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, but a slightly elevated risk of overall mortality. Since these findings were based on observational studies, they should be taken with a grain of salt.  It should be noted that the elevated mortality risk associated with butter is relatively small compared to many other foods, such as refined grains and sugar.  In conclusion, it seems there is no compelling reason to avoid butter. Moderate amounts should be fine. However, if you eat lots of it, it may be wise to replace some of it with oils that have proven health benefits, such as olive oil.  Tags: Butter , Heart disease

	How Does Snacking Affect Your Waistline?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 19, 2016  Many snack foods are unhealthy and easy to overeat.  In many cases, snack foods may contribute to the development of obesity. But does snacking itself affect body weight?  A recent review summarized the evidence. Below is an overview of its main points.   Article Reviewed  This review discussed how snacking affects satiety and body weight.  Snack Food, Satiety, and Weight.   What Are Snacks?  Snacks are any foods that are eaten between meals.  They often are ready-to-eat and do not require much preparation. These commonly include candy, chips, crackers, cookies, granola bars, nuts and popcorn.  Although beverages are usually not considered snack foods, they are consumed along with snack foods.  In this review, we place beverages under the broad definition of snack foods.  Bottom Line: Snacking is the act of consuming foods or beverages between meals.  Does Snacking Increase Weight Gain?  Snacking contributes to approximately 27% of the daily calorie intake among children. The percentage has been on the rise in recent decades in both children and adults ( 1 , 2 ).  The increased popularity of snacking goes hand in hand with increased screen time (watching TV and playing computer games) and less physical activity.  Additionally, highly processed, “unhealthy” snacks are the most popular, and there seems to be limited interest in healthy snacks in the general population ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).  For these reasons, unhealthy snacking often contributes to weight gain.  Bottom Line: Snacking may be largely responsible for weight gain among many people.  Is Snacking Healthy?  In general, nutrient-poor and calorie-rich snacks are considered unhealthy ( 6 , 7 ).  Unhealthy snacks include candy, chips, cookies and sugary beverages. Healthy snacks may include fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains.  That said, any snacks are unhealthy when snacking goes out of hand and starts contributing to excessive weight gain.  Studies also suggest that irregular eating habits , often associated with snacking, may adversely affect health.  Bottom Line: Healthy snacks can be very nutritious. However, snacking is unhealthy when it gets out of hand or involves unhealthy food.  What Factors Affect Snacking?  Snacking is affected by a variety of factors.  The following factors have been associated with snacking behavior:   Poor education: One study showed that snacking was more common among those from poorly educated families ( 8 ).  Knowledge: Being able to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy snacks affects food choice ( 9 ).  Emotional eating: Some people respond to negative emotions by eating, especially high-sugar, high-fat snacks ( 10 ).  Stress: Anxiety causes some people to snack, especially emotional eaters ( 10 ).  Family norms: One study showed that having strict parents reduced snacking among children ( 11 ).  Social norms: When young adults were led to believe that limiting junk foods was the social norm, their intake of high-calorie snacks decreased ( 12 ).  Availability: Limited access to healthy snacks affects intake ( 13 ).  Packaging: Bigger package sizes encourage overeating, regardless of peopleâs appetite or the taste of the snack ( 14 ).  Distractions: Mindful eating reduces snack intake, whereas distractions (like watching TV or playing a video game) increases it ( 15 ).  Variety: Having a wide variety of snacks to choose from can promote overeating ( 16 , 17 ).   Bottom Line: Numerous factors influence snacking behavior, including how often people snack, when they do it and how much they eat.  How Do Snacks Affect Appetite?  Some researchers have speculated that eating snacks might promote fullness or satiety, thus reducing the risk of overeating at the next meal ( 18 ).  One study found that snacks are generally not very filling. However, of all the snacks evaluated, those with the highest protein content were the most satiating ( 19 ).  Another study found that a high-protein afternoon snack delayed the need for dinner, compared to high-fat or high-carb snacks. In fact, the high-carb snack did not delay dinner at all ( 20 ).  High-protein snacks that may suppress appetite include:   Peanuts and tree nuts ( 21 , 22 ).  Greek yogurt ( 23 , 24 ).   Snacks that are high in fiber may also promote fullness, compared to low-fiber snacks. Popcorn is a good example of a common high-fiber snack food.  Additionally, low-fat (air popped) popcorn is significantly more satiating compared to an equal amount of potato chips ( 25 ).  Bottom Line: Snack foods that are high in protein and/or fiber may reduce appetite, compared to other types of snack foods.  Can Snacking Reduce Body Weight?  A few randomized controlled trials have examined how different snack foods affect body weight.  One trial in women showed that snacking on dark chocolate daily reduced body weight and fat mass, compared to fruit-flavored licorice ( 26 ).  Other studies comparing a variety of different snack foods found no differences in daily food intake or changes in body weight ( 27 , 28 , 29 ).  It appears that people may compensate for snacking by eating less food at meals. However, the calorie compensation is often only partial, and regular snacking may lead to weight gain over time ( 30 , 31 ).  Additionally, not all snacks are equal. One study showed that eating nut-based snack bars for 3 months reduced body fat and abdominal fat in overweight people, compared to a cereal snack bar ( 32 ).  Observational studies have also provided mixed results. Some studies showed no significant links between snack foods and weight or body weight ( 7 ).  These findings are partially supported by other observational studies. One important exception is sugary soda , which was significantly linked to obesity ( 33 , 34 ).  In general, it seems that snacking on calorie-dense, low-nutrient foods may promote weight gain. This especially applies to sugary soda.  That said, it is still unclear whether traditional snack foods reduce body weight, compared to not snacking. At this point, it seems unlikely.  Bottom Line: There is limited evidence that snack foods reduce body weight. In contrast, high-calorie snack foods may promote weight gain.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Taken together, studies investigating the effects of snack foods on body weight provide mixed results.  In general, high-calorie snack foods are believed to promote obesity, especially sugary soda. In contrast, people seem to partially compensate for consuming healthy snacks by eating less at the next meal.  Overall, there’s limited evidence that traditional snack foods lead to weight loss.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (September 9th–16th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 16, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Alternate-day fasting is as effective as a traditional weight loss diet, and possibly even better.  Taking vitamin D supplements reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks.  Omega-3 EPA may reduce depression, whereas omega-3 DHA doesn’t.  A high-nitrate diet may improve exercise performance.  Prenatal DHA supplementation may improve the child’s attention at preschool age.    Research Reviews  We reviewed two articles this week. One examined the effectiveness of alternate-day fasting for weight loss, while the other investigated whether taking vitamin D supplements may improve asthma.   Review:  Alternate-Day Fasting Is a Safe and Effective Weight Loss Strategy.  Article:  A randomized pilot study comparing zero-calorie alternate-day fasting to daily caloric restriction in adults with obesity.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of alternate-day fasting for weight loss and compared it to a traditional weight loss diet.  The study suggested that alternative-day fasting (ADF) is at least as effective as a standard, moderately calorie-reduced diet. There were some signs that ADF fasting is even more effective, but this needs to be studied further.   Review:  Vitamin D Reduces the Risk of Severe Asthma Attacks.  Article:  Vitamin D for the management of asthma.  Summary: This Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examined the effects of vitamin D on asthma symptoms in children and adults.  The study found that taking vitamin D supplements reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks that require injections. However, it did not affect day-to-day symptoms.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Inflammation  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Does basal metabolic rate predict weight gain?  Basal metabolic rate (BMR) represents the minimum number of calories your body needs to burn to sustain life. Some studies indicate that low BMR may predispose people to weight gain and obesity.  However, this prospective observational study showed that adults with low BMR did not gain more weight than those with high BMR. Differences in calorie intake or physical activity seem to counterbalance any variations in BMR.   Vitamin D status and weight loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized controlled weight-loss trials.  Previous observational studies show that obesity is associated with low vitamin D levels. However, the direction of causality is unclear.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that vitamin D status slightly improves when people lose weight, compared to weight maintenance.   Short- and Long-Term Effects of Wholegrain Oat Intake on Weight Management and Glucolipid Metabolism in Overweight Type-2 Diabetics: A Randomized Control Trial.  This was a controlled trial of 298 overweight and obese people with type 2 diabetes. They were randomized to one of four groups: (1) a low-fat, high-fiber diet (LH), (2) LH with 50 grams of oats, (3) LH with 100 grams of oats or (4) no dietary change.  Those diets that replaced cereals with oats significantly improved blood sugar control, the blood lipid profile and reduced body weight.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Intake of different types of dairy and its prospective association with risk of type 2 diabetes: the Rotterdam Study.  This observational study in Dutch adults who were 55 years and older found that total dairy intake was not associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. This association was the same for all subgroups of dairy products.   3. Heart Health  Associations between Dietary Fiber Intake in Infancy and Cardiometabolic Health at School Age: The Generation R Study.  This observational study in 2,032 Dutch children found that a high intake of dietary fiber in early childhood was associated with an improved blood lipid — higher levels of HDL cholesterol and lower levels of triglycerides — in late childhood.   4. Cancer  Marine {omega}-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis.  This observational study showed that high intake of marine polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids was linked with a lower risk of death from colorectal cancer.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Efficacy of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of depression.  Previous studies on the effectiveness of omega-3 polyunsaturated fat for treating depression have provided inconsistent results.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplements containing more than 50% EPA significantly benefited people with depression, compared to a placebo. In contrast, DHA had no effects.   The effect of healthy dietary consumption on executive cognitive functioning in children and adolescents: a systematic review.  This systematic review of observational studies in children and adolescents indicates that eating a healthy diet improves executive function, which are the mental skills needed for planning and carrying out tasks.   Prenatal supplementation with DHA improves attention at 5 y of age: a randomized controlled trial.  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that is an important part of the brain.  This was a controlled trial in 1,094 pregnant women. It showed that taking 400 mg of DHA from week 18–22 of pregnancy until delivery was associated with improved sustained attention when the child started preschool, compared to a placebo.   6. Kidney and Urinary Health  Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones in long-term studies of vitamin D supplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that long-term vitamin D supplementation increases the risk of hypercalcemia (excessive circulating calcium levels) and hypercalciuria (elevated calcium in urine).  Both of these conditions may impair kidney function. In contrast, supplementing with vitamin D seemed to have no effects on the risk of developing kidney stones.   7. Liver Health  Double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of anthocyanin-rich purple sweet potato beverage on serum hepatic biomarker levels in healthy Caucasians with borderline hepatitis.  Anthocyanins are a class of antioxidant flavonoids that are responsible for the vivid colors of many fruits and vegetables.  This controlled trial in people with borderline hepatitis tested the effects of drinking a beverage containing 177 mg of anthocyanins from purple sweet potatoes every day for 2 months. The beverage had no effects on any circulating markers of liver health.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Effects of a Short-Term High-Nitrate Diet on Exercise Performance.  Previous studies indicate that taking nitrate supplements may improve exercise performance. Nitrate is commonly taken in the form of sodium nitrate or as a component of beetroot juice.  This randomized crossover study in 7 healthy men showed that following a high-nitrate diet for 6 days significantly improved endurance and performance in a repeated sprint ability test.   9. Arthritis  Effects of the Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet and Sodium Intake on Serum Uric Acid.  Uric acid forms when the body breaks down dietary purines. The kidneys are responsible for removing uric acid from the blood. Some people may accumulate high levels of uric acid, potentially leading to gout, a type of inflammatory arthritis.  This crossover trial in adults with mild hypertension showed that following the DASH diet for 1 month lowered uric acid levels, especially among those with high levels to begin with. However, higher sodium intake also seemed to decrease uric acid levels.   10. Inflammation  Long-Term Immunomodulatory Effects of a Mediterranean Diet in Adults at High Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea (PREDIMED) Randomized Controlled Trial.  This controlled trial examined the effects of three diets: (1) a Mediterranean diet (MD) supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, (2) a MD supplemented with nuts or (3) a low-fat diet (placebo). Data were collected 3 and 5 years after the study started.  Both MD groups had lower levels of inflammatory markers, such as CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α, compared to the placebo. The authors suggested that these anti-inflammatory effects could explain the MD’s preventive effects against heart disease.   Maternal diet, gestational weight gain, and inflammatory markers during pregnancy.  This observational study in 671 pregnant women showed that excessive weight gain during pregnancy was linked with higher circulating levels of the inflammatory markers CRP and serum amyloid A.  Elevated levels of CRP were also associated with a high intake of animal protein.   11. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Intake of Caffeinated Soft Drinks before and during Pregnancy, but Not Total Caffeine Intake, Is Associated with Increased Cerebral Palsy Risk in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study.  Cerebral palsy is a physical disability that impairs movement and posture. CP is caused by damage to the developing brain during pregnancy or shortly after birth.  This observational study suggests that drinking a lot of caffeinated soft drinks during pregnancy may increase the risk of CP in newborn children with low birth weights. However, total caffeine consumption was not linked with CP risk.   Maternal protein intake during pregnancy and linear growth in the offspring.  This observational study indicates that a higher protein intake during pregnancy doesn’t increase the length of the fetus or infant. It may even reduce growth.   12. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Relationship between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and leucocyte telomere length by sex and race in a US study.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA that protect the strands from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate this, possibly contributing to aging.  This observational study in people 48–93 years old showed that vitamin D deficiency was associated with short telomeres in white blood cells. However, this association was only significant in white people.   Body mass index and all-cause mortality among older adults.  This observational study suggests that overweight or mildly obese older adults (with BMIs of 25.0–34.9) have a reduced risk of death, compared to those who have a normal weight (with BMIs of 18.5–24.9).

	Vitamin D Reduces the Risk of Severe Asthma Attacks  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 14, 2016  Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes breathing difficulties. The underlying cause is incompletely understood.  A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examined the effects of vitamin D supplements on asthma symptoms. Here is a summary its conclusions.   Background  Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lung airways.	It is characterized by attacks of breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing.  Several observational studies have associated low circulating levels of vitamin D with an increased risk of asthma attacks ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  These findings are partly supported by some meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Article Reviewed  This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the evidence linking asthma with vitamin D.  Vitamin D for the management of asthma.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of vitamin D supplements on asthma symptoms.  The researchers searched for all relevant studies using several databases.  Only studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected:   The studies had to be double-blind, randomized controlled trials.  The participants had to be asthmatic adults or children.  The main outcomes were asthma symptoms and/or the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms.  The studies had to last at least 3 months.   A total of nine trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the primary analysis — seven in children and two in adults.  The studies included a total of 1,093 participants — 435 children and 658 adults — and their length ranged from 4–12 months. Most of the participants had mild to moderate asthma.  Bottom Line: This was a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials examining the effects of vitamin D supplements on asthma symptoms in children and adults.  Finding 1: Vitamin D Reduced the Risk of Severe Asthma Attacks  The analysis showed that supplementing with vitamin D reduced the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms (asthma attacks) requiring asthma medication (corticosteroids) via injection.  Specifically, the risk decreased by 37%, on average. It also caused a 61% reduction in the risk of having at least one asthma attack requiring a visit to an emergency department or hospital.  The authors concluded that this reduction in severe asthma attacks had significant clinical relevance.  Bottom Line: Taking vitamin D supplements reduced the risk of severe asthma attacks requiring corticosteroid injections, hospitalization or a visit to an emergency department.  Finding 2: Vitamin D Did Not Affect Day-To-Day Asthma Symptoms  In contrast to the protective effects of vitamin D against severe asthma attacks, the researchers concluded that it did not significantly affect Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores.  The ACT score is used to determine if asthma symptoms are well controlled and what level of treatment may be required.  In addition, supplementing with vitamin D did not affect the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, which is a measure of lung function.  Bottom Line: Taking vitamin D supplements did not affect day-to-day asthma symptoms or lung function.  How Does Vitamin D Reduce the Risk of Asthma Attacks?  The analysis shows that taking vitamin D supplements may reduce the risk of asthma attacks.  The way vitamin D may improve asthma is not completely understood but may be explained in the following way:   Supplementing with vitamin D leads to increased levels of calcifediol (hydroxyvitamin D), which is the main form of vitamin D in the blood.  When needed, an enzyme known as CYP27B1 changes hydroxyvitamin D into calcitriol, the bioactive form of vitamin D.  Calcitriol is produced by various body tissues, mainly the kidneys. However, inflammation (as in asthma) leads to increased levels of CYP27B1 in the tissues surrounding the airways, promoting the formation of calcitriol in the lungs.  Calcitriol binds with the vitamin D receptor, which acts to reduce inflammation and stimulates the production of antimicrobial compounds ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  In this way, vitamin D could reduce the inflammation associated with asthma, potentially reducing the risk of severe asthma attacks.  Asthma attacks are also frequently brought about by lung infections. The way vitamin D strengthens the antimicrobial defenses of the lungs may also play a role.   Bottom Line: Vitamin D may reduce the risk of asthma by reducing airway inflammation and strengthening the antimicrobial defenses of the lungs.  Limitations  This meta-analysis was conducted according to accepted standards and didn’t appear to have any flaws. However, caution should be taken when generalizing the results to certain groups.  First, the conclusion that vitamin D protects against severe asthma attacks was mostly based on studies in adults. As a result, it cannot be generalized to children.  Second, the researchers were unable to look into the effects of vitamin D supplements in subgroups, such as those with severe asthma or vitamin D deficiency.  Bottom Line: The findings cannot be generalized to children, and the effects of vitamin D supplements in those with severe asthma symptoms or good vitamin D status are unclear.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this meta-analysis concludes that supplementing with vitamin D is likely to protect against severe asthma attacks. It also reduces the risk of having to visit an emergency department or stay in a hospital because of asthma.  Although vitamin D itself won’t cure asthma, supplementing with it seems to reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks in people with mild or moderate asthma.  However, studies in severely asthmatic people are lacking. Additionally, it is unclear if these benefits are confined to people with poor vitamin D status or a deficiency.  Tags: Asthma , Vitamin D

	Alternate-Day Fasting Is a Safe and Effective Weight Loss Strategy  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 12, 2016  Following a standard weight loss diet is difficult for most people. Therefore, different methods, such as intermittent fasting, are gaining popularity.  Recently, a randomized controlled trial compared the safety and effectiveness of alternate-day fasting to a traditional, calorie-reduced diet. Here is a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  When people diet, they eat less than they normally would.  Typically, an effective weight loss diet involves a 20–30% calorie deficit, relative to the amount of calories needed to maintain weight. It generally leads to a moderate 5–10% weight loss over a 6-month period ( 1 , 2 ).  However, sticking to a calorie-reduced diet for a long period is extremely difficult for most people ( 3 ).  For this reason, alternative strategies are growing in popularity. One such strategy is intermittent fasting, which involves eating little or nothing for specified periods and normally the rest of the time.  One common intermittent fasting approach is alternate-day fasting (ADF), which involves eating little or nothing every other day.  Like most other weight loss methods, ADF reduces the risk of heart disease and diabetes. It may also cause beneficial changes in appetite hormones ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Studies in overweight or obese adults indicate that ADF may cause 3–8% weight loss over a period of 2–12 weeks ( 7 , 8 ).  Yet, it’s still unclear whether ADF is an effective weight loss strategy. Until now, no studies have compared ADF to a traditional weight loss diet ( 9 ).  Article Reviewed  This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of alternate-day fasting to a standard weight loss diet.  A randomized pilot study comparing zero-calorie alternate-day fasting to daily caloric restriction in adults with obesity.  Study Design  This was a small, 2-month randomized controlled trial examining the safety and effectiveness of alternate-day fasting, compared to a traditional weight loss diet.  A total of 26 obese adults participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Alternate-day fasting (ADF): Participants fasted every other day. On non-fasting days, they could eat as much as they wanted. On fasting days, they were only allowed to consume water, calorie-free beverages and stocks or broths.  Traditional weight loss diet (TWD): Participants followed a calorie-restricted diet (a deficit of 400 calories per day) for two months.   In both groups, all food was provided by the study kitchen, and food intake was closely monitored. Additionally, the participants’ macronutrient intakes were standardized with 55% of calories from carbs, 15% from protein and 30% from fat.  At the start and end of the study, the researchers measured the following:   Body weight.  Body composition: Measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.  Blood lipids: Total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL were measured in fasting blood samples.  Blood sugar control: Evaluated with a glucose tolerance test.  Resting metabolic rate: Assessed in the morning using standard indirect calorimetry.  Appetite hormones: Leptin and ghrelin were measured in fasting blood samples.  Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).   When the study was over, the participants received standard weight maintenance advice. The above measurements were repeated after a 6-month unsupervised follow-up.  Summary: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of alternate-day fasting to a traditional weight loss diet.  Finding 1: Alternate-Day Fasting and Standard Dieting Caused Similar Weight Loss  Alternate-day fasting (ADF) and the traditional weight loss diet (TWD) caused similar weight loss.  Specifically, those who fasted every other day lost 18.1 pounds (8.2 kg), on average, whereas those who dieted every day lost 15.7 pounds (7.1 kg), as shown in the chart below.   Although the weight loss was slightly higher among those who fasted every other day, the difference was not statistically significant. However, the relative weight loss (percentage of body weight) was nearly significant.  Further studies with a greater number of participants and more statistical power are needed to determine whether this difference is real or just a chance occurrence.  Summary: Alternate-day fasting led to weight loss similar to that of a standard weight loss diet with a moderate calorie deficit.  Finding 2: Alternate-Day Fasting Led to a Greater Calorie Deficit  Participants who fasted every other day achieved a greater calorie deficit.  They consumed 376 fewer calories per day, on average, compared to those who were on the traditional weight loss diet.  The chart below shows the differences in calorie deficit between groups.   This is a large reduction in calories that should lead to considerable weight loss over two months.  However, this extra calorie deficit didn’t seem to significantly affect weight loss, as shown in the previous section.  Possible explanations include the underreporting of food intake in the ADF group or a reduction in the number of calories burned.  Summary: Alternate-day fasting seemed to cause a greater calorie deficit, on average, compared to a traditional weight loss diet.  Finding 3: Alternative-Fasting Had Favorable Effects on Body Composition  After the intervention part of the study had ended, the researchers followed the participants for an additional six months.  During these six months, there were no significant changes in weight regain between groups.  However, when the researchers compared values from the start of the intervention, changes in percent fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM) were significantly more favorable among those who fasted every other day.  These findings are presented in the chart below.   These findings should be interpreted with caution since there were some between-group differences in body weight at the start of the study.  Summary: Alternate-day fasting appeared to beneficially affect body composition, compared to a traditional weight loss diet.  Finding 4: Resting Metabolic Rate Decreased in Both Groups  Both alternate-day fasting and traditional dieting caused a drop in the number of calories burned at rest (resting metabolic rate).  This effect is known as metabolic adaptation or starvation mode — the body’s response to a calorie deficit.  When the decrease in resting metabolic rate (RMR) was adjusted for fat mass and lean mass, the difference between groups became marginally significant. The findings are presented in the chart below.   Summary: Both alternate-day fasting and a calorie-reduced diet caused a decrease in resting metabolic rate.  Finding 5: Alternate-Day Fasting Caused an Increase in BDNF  Previous studies suggest that fasting may improve mental performance, possibly due to changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).  BDNF may also be involved in the regulation of energy balance ( 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ).  In the current study, there were no differences in BDNF levels between groups.  However, at the end of the follow-up period, the researchers discovered that levels of BDNF had increased significantly among those in the ADF group, compared to the TWD group, as shown in the chart below.   These findings suggest that ADF may lead to long-term changes in the formation of BDNF, which might promote weight loss maintenance. This needs to be studied further.  Summary: Alternate-day fasting led to an increase in brain-derived neurotropic factor. The health relevance of this is unclear.  Finding 6: Effects of Alternate-Day Fasting on Appetite Hormones  Previous studies indicate that alternate-day fasting increases fullness after meals , as well as levels of the satiety hormone peptide YY ( 14 ).  In the present study, the researchers measured leptin (a satiety hormone) and ghrelin (the hunger hormone) at the start and end of the study. The findings are presented in the chart below.   There were no significant differences in hormone changes between groups.  ADF also led to improvements in blood lipids. Once again, there were no significant between-group differences.  Summary: Alternate-day fasting and a traditional weight loss diet similarly affected the appetite hormones ghrelin and leptin.  Limitations  The main limitation of the study was its small size. The low statistical power may explain the lack of significant differences in some of the outcomes.  Second, physical activity levels weren’t monitored. This might have affected the results.  Third, the researchers didn’t know how many of the participants continued following the ADF or TWD during the follow-up period.  Finally, food intake was strictly controlled, and the findings may not be generalized to a free-living population.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study suggests that alternate-day fasting is safe and at least as effective as a moderate, calorie-reduced diet.  It did not raise the risk of weight regain during the first six months after the weight loss program finished.  Although weight loss wasn’t significantly different between groups, there were some signs that alternate-day fasting may be more beneficial than continuous dieting. These findings need to be confirmed by larger studies.  Tags: Fasting , Weight loss

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (September 2nd–9th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 9, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Eating your largest meal earlier in the day may promote weight loss.  High fruit and vegetable intakes do not counterbalance the health risks of high red meat consumption.  High intake of regular-fat cheese does not increase risk markers of metabolic syndrome.  Advanced glycation end-products (glycotoxins) may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.  Pomegranate extract reduces the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.  Supplementing with folic acid may reduce heart disease risk among those who lack it.    Research Reviews  We reviewed two articles this week: one examining how meal timing affects weight loss and the other investigating whether high intakes of fruits and vegetables offset the harmful effects of high red meat intake.   Review:  Timing Matters: Eat Early to Improve Weight Loss.  Article:  Beneficial effect of high energy intake at lunch rather than dinner on weight loss in healthy obese women in a weight-loss program: a randomized clinical trial.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial compared the weight loss effects of a high-calorie meal either at lunch or dinner.  The study showed that eating a large lunch improved weight loss success, compared to eating an equally large meal at dinner.   Review:  Fruits and Vegetables Don’t Offset the Health Risks of High Red Meat Intake.  Article:  High red meat intake and all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality: is the risk modified by fruit and vegetable intake?  Summary: This observational study examined the association of red meat intake with the risk of death from heart disease or cancer. Its main purpose was to find out whether high intakes of fruits and vegetables mitigated this risk.  The researchers discovered that high fruit and vegetable intakes did not reduce or offset the risks associated with high red meat intake.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Skin Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Metabolic Syndrome  Dietary intake of manganese and the risk of the metabolic syndrome in a Chinese population.  This observational study in 2,111 Chinese adults showed that higher dietary intake of manganese was associated with a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome in men and an increased risk in women.  High manganese intake was associated with low HDL levels in both genders. It was also linked to lower triglyceride levels and a reduced risk of abdominal obesity in men.   High intake of regular-fat cheese compared with reduced-fat cheese does not affect LDL cholesterol or risk markers of the metabolic syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.  This 3-month randomized controlled trial in 164 adults examined the effects of eating cheese on risk markers of metabolic syndrome (MS).  The study found that eating 80 grams of regular-fat cheese every day for three months did not increase LDL cholesterol levels or risk factors for MS, compared to reduced-fat cheese or a calorie-matched amount of high-carb foods.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effect of Consuming Oat Bran Mixed in Water before a Meal on Glycemic Responses in Healthy Humans—A Pilot Study.  This small trial in 10 healthy adults investigated the effects of oat bran on blood sugar control.  The study showed that eating oat bran before a meal consisting of white bread significantly reduced blood sugar levels, compared to white bread only. Analyses revealed that each gram of oat beta-glucan reduced blood sugar levels by 4.4%.   Healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns are related to pre-diabetes: a case–control study.  Prediabetes is a health condition that’s a precursor to diabetes. It’s also associated with an increased risk of heart disease.  This observational study in Iranian people showed that high intakes of vegetables, fruits and legumes were associated with a reduced risk of PD. In contrast, high intakes of candy, solid fat, meat and mayonnaise was linked with an increased risk.   Oral AGE restriction ameliorates insulin resistance in obese individuals with the metabolic syndrome: a randomised controlled trial.  Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a group of compounds that naturally form in your body when sugar reacts with protein. High blood sugar levels promote their formation, but AGEs are also found in some processed food products.  This randomized controlled trial in obese people with metabolic syndrome showed that a diet low in AGEs reduced insulin resistance and possibly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.   3. Heart Health  Dairy fat and risk of cardiovascular disease in 3 cohorts of US adults.  This prospective observational study examined the association of dairy fat with heart disease risk in 222,234 US adults.  Dairy fat was not significantly linked with an increased risk of heart disease. However, replacing dairy fat with unsaturated fat reduced the risk. In contrast, replacing it with other animal fats increased it.   Dietary Intake and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Icelanders Following Voluntarily a Low Carbohydrate Diet.  This small observational study in 54 Icelandic adults examined heart disease risk factors in those who had been on a low-carb diet for at least six months. It then compared them to those of people following a normal diet.  Those who were on a low-carb diet consumed high amounts of fat and red meat, exceeding official recommendations. They also ate very little fiber, fruits and vegetables. Yet, risk factors for heart disease were generally within the normal range.   Folic Acid Supplementation and the Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplementing with folic acid may reduce the overall risk of heart disease by 4% and stroke by 10%.  Folic acid appeared to more greatly benefit people with lower circulating levels of folate and those who didn’t have heart disease to begin with.   Dietary Saturated Fatty Acids and Coronary Heart Disease Risk in a Dutch Middle-Aged and Elderly Population.  This observational study in Dutch, middle-aged and elderly people found that higher dietary intake of palmitic acid (a major type of saturated fat) was associated with a higher risk of heart disease.  In contrast, total saturated fat intake was not significantly linked with an increased risk of heart disease.   4. Appetite and Eating  The effect of two weeks ingestion of a bitter tastant mixture on energy intake in overweight females.  Some scientists have hypothesized that eating bitter foods might reduce calorie intake by activating bitter taste receptors in the digestive tract. This idea is supported by a few human studies investigating the effects of a single meal.  However, this randomized controlled trial in overweight women showed that taking a bitter mixture in capsule form twice daily for two weeks did not affect calorie intake, compared to a placebo.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Intake of High-Fat Yogurt, but Not of Low-Fat Yogurt or Prebiotics, Is Related to Lower Risk of Depression in Women of the SUN Cohort Study.  This prospective observational study in 14,539 adults showed that eating a lot of full-fat yogurt was linked with a lower risk of depression.  In contrast, prebiotics or low-fat yogurts were not significantly associated with depression. Additionally, yogurt didn’t reduce the risk of depression in men.   Association between inflammatory potential of diet and risk of depression in middle-aged women: the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods may be pro-inflammatory, whereas others may be anti-inflammatory or neutral.  This prospective observational study in Australian women showed that a high DII score increased the risk of depression by 20%, compared to foods that had the lowest DII scores.   6. Bone Health  Dietary patterns in an elderly population and their relation with bone mineral density: the Rotterdam Study.  Bone mineral density (BMD) tends to decrease with age. Low BMD is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.  This observational study in elderly Dutch people found high intakes of potatoes, meat and fat were associated with higher BMD. Another dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, poultry and fish, was also linked with higher BMD.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Ingestion of Wheat Protein Increases In Vivo Muscle Protein Synthesis Rates in Healthy Older Men in a Randomized Trial.  Protein intake temporarily stimulates the formation of muscle protein. Animal protein, which contains all of the essential amino acids, is generally believed to be a stronger stimulant of muscle protein synthesis than plant proteins.  This randomized controlled trial in 60 older men confirmed previous findings, showing that eating 35 grams of casein (milk protein) increased muscle protein synthesis more than an equal amount of wheat protein.   L -Arginine supplementation does not enhance blood flow and muscle performance in healthy and physically active older women.  Previous studies have suggested that supplementing with arginine may stimulate blood flow by promoting the formation of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide functions as a vasodilator, causing blood vessels to dilate (widen).  This randomized controlled trial in older women showed that taking a single dose of L-arginine didn’t increase blood flow or improve muscle performance during strength exercise.   8. Arthritis  Pomegranate extract alleviates disease activity and some blood biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the joints. It’s characterized by inflamed, swollen and painful joints, most commonly in the hands.  This randomized controlled trial in people with RA showed that taking 500 mg of pomegranate extract daily for two months significantly reduced inflammatory markers and RA symptoms, such as pain, morning stiffness and swollen and tender joints.   9. Skin Health  Comparison of Vitamin D Levels in Patients with and without Acne: A Case-Control Study Combined with a Randomized Controlled Trial.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for two months reduced the symptoms of acne in people with vitamin D deficiency.  A related observational study also revealed that vitamin D deficiency was more common in people with acne, and low vitamin D levels were associated with greater acne severity.   10. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Prolonged Exclusive Breastfeeding Duration Is Positively Associated with Risk of Anemia in Infants Aged 12 Months.  This observational study in young Chinese children and infants suggests that those who are exclusively breastfed for more than six months are at an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia .  The authors recommend that parents start feeding infants with adequate sources of iron at six months of age.   Pre-pregnancy caffeine and caffeinated beverage intake and risk of spontaneous abortion.   This observational study suggests that drinking a lot of coffee may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion among pregnant women.  Specifically, it found that drinking four or more servings of coffee per day before pregnancy increased the risk of abortion by 20%, compared to those that didn’t drink any coffee.   11. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Nutrition and mortality in the elderly over 10 years of follow-up: the Three-City study.  This prospective observational study investigated the association of all-cause mortality (death) with dietary habits in 8,937 elderly individuals.  The study showed that those who consumed the most fruits, vegetables and fish were at the lowest risk of death. On the other hand, daily consumption of meat was linked with a higher risk of death.

	Fruits and Vegetables Don’t Offset the Health Risks of High Red Meat Intake  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 7, 2016  Numerous observational studies have associated a high intake of red meat with an increased risk of heart disease and cancer.  In contrast, a high intake of fruits and vegetables is linked with a reduced risk of heart disease and cancer.  A recent observational study investigated whether high intakes of fruits and vegetables would counterbalance the link between red meat intake and poor health. Here is a summary of its findings.   Background  Observational studies suggest that eating a lot of red meat may increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer and premature death ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ).  These associations are quite consistent across studies and populations. However, observational studies have a major weakness â they cannot prove causality.  As a result, scientists are still not entirely sure if high red meat intake itself is harmful or if other factors related to high red meat intake are responsible ( 1 , 6 ).  The unhealthy lifestyle habits sometimes associated with high red meat intake include:   Lower-quality diet ( 7 , 8 ).  Low consumption of fruits and vegetables ( 9 ).   Nevertheless, some scientists believe that certain components of red meat, especially in processed red meat or overcooked meat, may at least partially explain these associations.  Accordingly, some observational studies have linked processed meat with adverse health effects but not unprocessed, fresh red meat ( 5 , 10 , 11 ).  Researchers have hypothesized that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables might partially offset the harmful effects of high red meat intake ( 9 ).  This hypothesis is supported by evidence indicating that high meat intake does not increase the risk of death when intake of fruits and vegetable is comparable to that of vegetarians ( 12 , 13 ).  Article Reviewed  This observational study investigated the association of red meat intake with the risk of death from chronic disease at different levels of fruit and vegetable intake.  High red meat intake and all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality: is the risk modified by fruit and vegetable intake?  Study Design  This observational study examined whether high intakes of fruits and vegetables could offset the adverse health effects of red meat intake.  The researchers evaluated data from two large prospective studies, including a total of 74,645 Swedish men and women.  Food intake was evaluated using self-administered questionnaires asking how often people consumed fruits, vegetables, fresh meat or processed meat.  Fresh meats included fresh and minced pork, beef and veal, whereas processed meat included sausages, hot dogs, salami, ham, processed meat cuts, liver pate and blood sausage.  Bottom Line: This was an observational study investigating whether high intakes of fruits and vegetables can counterbalance the negative health effects of high red meat intake.  Finding 1: Red Meat Was Linked With an Increased Risk of Death  The study showed that eating a lot of red meat increased the risk of death from heart disease by 29% and the overall risk of death by 21%. However, it was not significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cancer.  The chart below shows the percent changes in the risk of death, compared to the lowest quintile of red meat consumption (less than 46 grams per day).   Interestingly, these associations were largely reduced when limiting the analyses to non-processed (fresh) red meat, suggesting that processed meat may be to blame.  Bottom Line: The study showed that a high intake of red meat, especially processed red meat, was significantly linked with an increased risk of death from heart disease or other causes.  Finding 2: Eating Fruits and Vegetables Didn’t Reduce the Health Risks of Red Meat Intake  The researchers discovered that red meat intake was associated with an increased risk of death, irrespective of how many fruits and vegetables people were eating.  The harmful effects of red meat were clearly dose dependent. The higher the intake, the more likely the participants were to die during the follow-up period.  Additionally, this association of red meat with death was independent of education status or unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking or alcohol consumption.  The researchers also found that fruit and vegetable intake was not associated with total red meat intake or the intake of processed meat.  In other words, those who ate a lot of red meat didn’t necessarily eat less fruit and vegetables (FV), as shown in the chart below.   However, a high fruit and vegetable intake wasn’t associated with reduced risk of death from heart disease or other causes.  Bottom Line: High red meat intake was consistently associated with an increased risk of death at all levels of fruit and vegetable intake.  Limitations  The study’s main limitation was its observational design â it couldn’t demonstrate causality.  Second, food intake was self-assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), which are often inaccurate.  In addition, the questionnaires didn’t ask about lamb and game meat intake, which might have skewed the results.  Third, the study revealed no protective effects from fruit and vegetable consumption. This might explain why they didn’t counterbalance the increased risk associated with red meat intake.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this observational study indicates that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables does not counterbalance the harmful effects of high red meat intake.  However, since the study had a few limitations, its findings should be taken with a grain of salt. The results need to be confirmed in future studies.  Tags: Fruit , Red meat , Vegetables

	Timing Matters: Eat Early to Improve Weight Loss  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 5, 2016  Successful weight loss may not only depend on how much you eat and exercise but also the timing of your meals.  A recent study examined the relevance of meal timing among overweight or obese women on a weight loss program.  The researchers compared the effects of eating a large number of calories either at lunch or dinner on weight loss. Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Growing evidence from controlled trials suggests that the timing of your meals may affect your health.  For example, eating most of your daily calories late in the afternoon or evening may adversely affect your blood sugar control ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Also, some studies show that eating a lot in the late afternoon or evening, relative to earlier in the day, may reduce calorie expenditure and promote weight gain ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  These findings are supported by studies indicating that consuming more than half of your daily calorie intake at or before midday is associated with a lower risk of obesity, compared to eating that amount in the late afternoon or evening ( 7 ).  Article Reviewed  This study compared the effects of eating a high-calorie meal either at lunch or dinner on weight loss success among obese women.  Beneficial effect of high energy intake at lunch rather than dinner on weight loss in healthy obese women in a weight-loss program: a randomized clinical trial.  Study Design  This 3-month, randomized trial compared the effects of eating a high-calorie meal either at lunch or dinner on weight loss and heart disease risk factors in women.  A total of 80 overweight or obese women who were otherwise healthy participated in the study. 86% of them completed the study.  At the beginning of the study, all of the participants started a weight loss program that was designed to promote 7â10% loss of body weight over a 12-week period.  The program involved both diet and exercise and addressed potential difficulties on an individual basis.  The participants were advised to gradually increase physical activity levels up to 60 minutes of moderate activity five days a week.  Additionally, all participants were told to consume 15% of their daily calories at breakfast and 15% from snacks. Their calorie intake at lunch and dinner differed depending on which experimental group they were randomly assigned to:   Main meal at lunch: 50% of daily calorie intake at lunch and 20% at dinner.  Main meal at dinner: 50% of daily calorie intake at dinner and 20% at lunch.   To improve adherence to the diet, the participants had a meeting with a dietitian twice a week and recieved a phone call every weekday.  At the start and end of the study, the researchers measured the following:   Body weight.  Waist circumference.  Calorie and macronutrient intakes.  Fasting blood lipids â total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides.  Fasting blood sugar, insulin and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).  Insulin resistance was calculated using homeostatic model assessment (HOMA).   Bottom Line: This was a randomized trial comparing the health and weight loss effects of eating a high-calorie meal either at lunch or dinner.  Finding 1: A Large Lunch Meal Caused More Weight Loss  The participants lost significant amounts of weight, on average.  However, having a large meal at noon promoted more weight loss (-12.9 lbs or -5.9 kg), compared to eating an equally large meal at dinner (-9.6 lbs or -4.4 kg), as shown in the chart below.   In contrast, there were no significant differences in waist circumference between groups.  Bottom Line: Eating a large meal at noon led to greater weight loss, compared to an equally large meal at dinner.  Finding 2: A Large Lunch Meal Improved Insulin Sensitivity  The weight loss program improved blood sugar control among all of the participants, but those who ate a large meal at lunch experienced slightly greater benefits.  Fasting insulin levels decreased by 2.01 mIU/mL among those who ate their largest daily meal at noon but only 0.72 mIU/mL among those whose main meal was dinner. Insulin resistance also improved in the lunch group, as shown below.   On the other hand, there were no significant differences in blood sugar or blood lipid levels between groups.  Bottom Line: Having a large meal at noon had greater benefits for blood sugar control, compared to eating an equally large dinner.  Why Does Eating a Large Meal Early in the Day Promote Weight Loss?  Controlled trials consistently show that eating most of your daily calories early in the day (at breakfast or lunch) may promote weight loss.  Scientists are not entirely sure how this happens, but they have come up with a few plausible theories:   Increased fullness: A large early meal may lead to lower calorie intake throughout the day. The current study doesn’t support this hypothesis, as both groups appeared to be eating similar amounts of calories over the day ( 8 ).  Reduced calorie expenditure: One study showed that an early meal caused a greater increase in metabolic rate and calorie expenditure than an identical meal eaten in the evening ( 4 ).   Further studies need to look into the possible physiological mechanisms. Since these effects are time dependent, they might have something to do with the body clock .  Bottom Line: It is incompletely understood why early meals may promote weight loss. Some studies suggest they may increase calorie expenditure.  Limitations  The study was well designed and doesn’t appear to have had any major flaws. However, the authors pointed out a few limitations.  First, the intervention period was relatively short, or just three months. Longer trials are needed to find out if the effects are sustained in the longer term.  Second, the participants were overweight and obese women. Future studies should confirm these findings in other groups.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that meal timing and daily calorie distribution may affect metabolism.  Specifically, the study showed that eating a large meal early in the day, such as at noon, improves the results of a weight loss program, compared to eating a large meal later in the day.  Eating the day’s main meal for lunch also reduced fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance.  If you are trying to lose weight and want to maximize your chances of success, eating your day’s largest meal for breakfast or lunch might be worth a shot.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (August 26th–September 2nd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 2, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Obesity is associated with an elevated risk of 13 types of cancer.  Dietary intake of magnesium significantly improves blood sugar control.  High-dose iron supplementation adversely affects gut microbiota.  Supplementing with ginger may reduce inflammation.  Supplementing with prebiotics may reduce asthma and inflammation in the airways.  Coenzyme Q10 may be good for your skin.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two articles: one looking at the association between excess weight and cancer and another investigating the effects of magnesium on blood sugar control.   Review:  Excess Body Fat Is Linked to Increased Cancer Risk.  Article:  Body Fatness and Cancer — Viewpoint of the IARC Working Group.  Summary: This was a special report from the IARC Working Group, which is a part of the World Health Organization. It concluded that there is sufficient evidence linking excess body fat with 13 different types of cancer.   Review:  Magnesium May Improve Your Blood Sugar Levels.  Article:  Effect of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism in people with or at risk of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials.  Summary: This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the link between magnesium supplementation and blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes and those at a high risk of developing it.  The analysis showed magnesium may improve blood sugar control in these groups.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Inflammation  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Infections and Immune Health  Skin Health  Sleep  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  The Effect of Green Tea Ingestion and Interval Sprinting Exercise on the Body Composition of Overweight Males: A Randomized Trial.  This 12-week randomized controlled trial in 48 overweight men showed that green tea did not significantly affect body weight or abdominal fat. However, it increased fat burning during submaximal exercise.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Associations of Serum Manganese Levels with Prediabetes and Diabetes among ≥60-Year-Old Chinese Adults: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Analysis.  This cross-sectional, observational study in older Chinese adults showed that those who had moderate circulating levels of manganese were the least likely to have type 2 diabetes.   Manipulating the sequence of food ingestion improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients under free-living conditions.  Eating protein or fat before a high-carb meal reduces the subsequent rise in blood sugar. This strategy is especially important for people with type 2 diabetes.  This 8-week, randomized controlled trial in 17 diabetics showed that a weight-loss diet that followed this pattern significantly improved fasting blood sugar, HbA1c and blood sugar levels after meals, compared to a control diet.   Associations of dietary intakes of anthocyanins and berry fruits with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  Anthocyanins are a class of flavonoid antioxidants found in high amounts in many fruits, especially berries.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that high intakes of anthocyanins and/or berries reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Specifically, for each 7.5 mg of anthocyanins consumed per day, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 5%.   Fruit and vegetable intake and risk of incident of type 2 diabetes: results from the consortium on health and ageing network of cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES).  This observational study in people over 50 years old found no significant links between fruits, vegetables and type 2 diabetes.   3. Heart Health  Fat type in phytosterol products influence their cholesterol-lowering potential: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.  Phytosterols are a class of plant compounds related to cholesterol. Although their benefits for heart health are debated, their cholesterol-lowering properties are well known. For this reason, they are often added to spreads and dairy products.  This meta-analysis concluded that when phytosterols are added to rapeseed oil-based spreads, they reduced cholesterol levels more than if they were added to sunflower or soybean oil-based spreads.   Dietary choline and betaine; associations with subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease risk and incidence of CVD, coronary heart disease and stroke: the Jackson Heart Study.  Choline is an essential nutrient found in high amounts in eggs, liver and fish roe (caviar). Betaine (trimethylglycine) is another nutrient found in plant foods, such as quinoa, spinach and beets.  This observational study in African-American adults showed that higher choline intake was associated with a lower risk of stroke. In contrast, high betaine intake was linked with a higher risk of heart disease.   4. Cancer  Vitamin D Intake and Risk of Skin Cancer in US Women and Men.  This observational study in US adults found that a high vitamin D intake was associated with an increased risk of a skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma.  In contrast, vitamin D intake was not linked to squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma.   5. Appetite and Eating  Effects on satiation, satiety and food intake of wholegrain and refined grain pasta.  This crossover trial showed that whole-grain pasta reduced appetite and hunger, compared to a refined-grain pasta. However, neither significantly affected calorie intake at subsequent meals.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Vitamin B-12 status and neurologic function in older people: a cross-sectional analysis of baseline trial data from the Older People and Enhanced Neurological Function (OPEN) study.  Vitamin B12 levels generally decline as people age. Serious vitamin B12 deficiency may cause neurological damage, but the effects of moderate vitamin B12 deficiency are unclear.  This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial in older people didn’t show any association between vitamin B12 levels and neurological function.   7. Digestive Health  Iron Fortification of Foods for Infants and Children in Low-Income Countries: Effects on the Gut Microbiome, Gut Inflammation, and Diarrhea.  Micronutrient powders (MNPs) are frequently used to prevent iron deficiency among African children. While the high amount of iron in these MNPs effectively prevents iron deficiency, it may have some adverse digestive effects.  For example, MNPs may cause diarrhea, increase gut inflammation, reduce beneficial gut bacteria and increase the amounts of potentially harmful bacteria. They should be replaced with safer alternatives.   Effect of Vitamin E With Therapeutic Iron Supplementation on Iron Repletion and Gut Microbiome in US Iron Deficient Infants and Toddlers.  High-dose iron supplementation may increase gut inflammation and adversely affect gut microbiota. Taking iron supplements with antioxidants, such as vitamin E, might help mitigate these effects.  This randomized controlled trial in infants showed that supplementing with 6 grams of iron every day for 2 months prevented iron deficiency. Taking vitamin E with the iron supplements improved the gut microbiota profile, compared to iron alone.   8. Inflammation  Effect of Ginger Supplementation on Proinflammatory Cytokines in Older Patients with Osteoarthritis: Outcomes of a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.  This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of supplementing with ginger on inflammatory markers in older adults with osteoarthritis.  The study found that supplementing with 500 mg of ginger powder every day for 3 months reduced inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-1β), compared to a placebo.   9. Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  A prebiotic galactooligosaccharide mixture reduces severity of hyperpnoea-induced bronchoconstriction and markers of airway inflammation.  The gut microbiota may affect immune system function and allergies. This trial in adults with asthma examined the effects of a prebiotic galactooligosaccharide (GOS) mixture on exercise-induced asthma and airway inflammation.  The study showed that supplementing with 5.5 grams of GOS per day for 3 weeks reduced the severity of exercise-induced asthma and decreased markers of airway inflammation.   10. Infections and Immune Health  Xylitol sugar supplement for preventing middle ear infection in children up to 12 years of age.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol commonly used to sweeten chewing gums and confectionery. It also has antibiotic effects and may reduce tooth decay.  This systematic review concluded that xylitol in chewing gum, lozenges or syrup may reduce acute middle ear infections by 30–32% in children without upper respiratory infections.   11. Skin Health  The effect of dietary intake of coenzyme Q10 on skin parameters and condition: Results of a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.  Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that plays a central role in the body’s energy generation.  This 12-week randomized controlled trial in 33 healthy people showed that supplementing with coenzyme Q10 reduced some signs of skin aging, such as wrinkles, and improved skin smoothness.   12. Sleep  Habitual Alcohol Consumption and Metabolic Syndrome in Patients with Sleep Disordered Breathing.  Breathing difficulties during sleep are collectively known as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).  This observational study showed that regular alcohol consumption was significantly associated with greater SDB. Sleep quality, as well as SDB, were the worst in heavy drinkers.   13. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Dietary patterns, food groups and telomere length: a systematic review of current studies.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands that protect them from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate their shortening, possibly contributing to aging.  This systematic review identified a few dietary patterns that were linked to longer telomeres. These included the Mediterranean diet, high intakes of fruits and vegetables and low intakes of cereals, processed meat and sugary beverages.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Magnesium May Improve Your Blood Sugar Levels  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 1, 2016  Supplementing with magnesium has been popular in recent years and is claimed to improve health in many ways.  Not all of these claims are backed by science, but there is convincing evidence linking magnesium supplementation to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.  A recent meta-analysis examined the effects of magnesium supplementation in diabetics or people at a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Here is a summary of its findings.   Background  Observational studies suggest that magnesium insufficiency or deficiency is linked with heart disease and several metabolic disorders, including hypertension, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  One large meta-analysis of observational studies including more than half a million participants showed that higher magnesium intake was associated with a lower risk of T2D ( 4 ).  Other studies have also shown that diabetics tend to have lower levels of magnesium, compared to healthy people ( 5 , 6 ).  However, the direction of causality is unclear. Diabetes might promote magnesium depletion or, alternatively, magnesium deficiency might increase the risk of T2D.  Randomized controlled trials support the second option. They show that supplementing with magnesium improves the symptoms of T2D, indicating that poor dietary intake of magnesium may, at least partly, contribute to its development ( 7 ).  But there is also some evidence suggesting that T2D may increase magnesium depletion, creating a vicious cycle ( 8 ).  Article Reviewed  This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of magnesium supplementation on blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) or those at a high risk of developing it.  Effect of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism in people with or at risk of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of magnesium supplementation on markers of blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity.  The researchers searched for relevant articles using five of the largest scientific databases.  The inclusion criteria were the following:   A double-blind, randomized controlled trial.  Participants were diabetic or at a high risk of developing T2D.  The studies examined oral magnesium supplementation.  Outcomes included markers of glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity.   A total of 18 randomized controlled trials fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria â 12 studies included people with T2D and 6 included people at a high risk of diabetes.  Bottom Line: This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the association of magnesium supplementation with blood sugar control in diabetics or people at a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  Finding 1: Magnesium Reduced Fasting Blood Sugar Levels  The analysis showed that supplementing with magnesium significantly reduced fasting blood sugar levels in people with T2D or at a high risk of it, compared to a placebo.  Specifically, the standard mean difference was -0.4, which means that magnesium caused a moderate improvement (decrease) in blood sugar levels.  However, magnesium did not affect fasting blood sugar levels in people who didn’t have type 2 diabetes.  Additionally, levels of fasting insulin, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) or HbA1c didn’t change significantly.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with magnesium reduced fasting blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.  Finding 2: Magnesium Reduced the Rise in Blood Sugar After Eating Sugar  An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures the changes in blood sugar after eating a dose of pure sugar (glucose). It is currently the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes.  Three of the included studies investigated the effects of magnesium on blood sugar levels during an OGTT in people at a high risk of developing diabetes.  Based on these studies, the researchers concluded that supplementing with magnesium significantly reduces blood sugar levels after eating sugar.  Specifically, the standard mean difference was -0.35, which is a moderate effect.  These findings were supported by one study that measured OGT in diabetics ( 9 ).  Bottom Line: Supplementing with magnesium significantly reduced the rise in blood sugar during an oral glucose tolerance test.  Finding 3: High Magnesium Levels Associated With Lower HbA1c Levels in Diabetics  Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a marker of the previous three-month average in blood sugar levels.  Analyses revealed that high magnesium levels correlated with lower levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with T2D, supporting the overall findings of the meta-analysis.  However, supplementing with magnesium did not affect HbA1c levels, probably because changes in HbA1c are slow and many of the studies were short in duration.  Magnesium status was also associated with improved insulin sensitivity in people at a high risk of T2D, but no significant links were detected in diabetics.  Bottom Line: Observational studies showed that high magnesium levels were linked with lower HbA1c levels in diabetics.  How Does Magnesium Deficiency Impair Blood Sugar Control?  The meta-analysis strongly suggests that supplementing with magnesium benefits diabetics and those at a high risk of it.  There are several mechanisms by which magnesium insufficiency could impair blood sugar control.   Sustained magnesium deficiency appears to reduce blood sugar uptake ( 10 , 11 ).  Low magnesium levels may impair insulin release from the beta-cells in the pancreas ( 12 , 13 ).  Poor magnesium status might increase oxidative stress, possibly increasing insulin resistance ( 10 ).   Bottom Line: Magnesium deficiency could impair blood sugar control by reducing sugar uptake (insulin sensitivity), impairing insulin release and/or increasing oxidative stress.  Limitations  This meta-analysis seems to have been designed well, and it followed accepted guidelines.  Although the included trials were generally high-quality, they included few participants and were generally short in duration. Long-term trials are needed.  Finally, the included studies varied in their design. For example, the doses of magnesium, as well as its form, differed considerably across studies.  Bottom Line: The included studies were generally of short duration, and their designs varied.  Summary and Real-Life Application  The researchers concluded that supplementing with magnesium may improve blood sugar control in diabetics, as well as people at a high risk of developing diabetes.  If you are diabetic or at risk of developing diabetes, supplementing with magnesium may be a good idea. However, you can also get all the magnesium you need from whole foods.  Magnesium-rich foods include whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, dark leafy greens and fish. It is also abundant in coffee, cocoa and dark chocolate.  Tags: Blood sugar , Diabetes , Magnesium

	Excess Body Fat Is Linked to Increased Cancer Risk  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 29, 2016  Cancer is one of the leading causes of death.  Earlier this year, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) assembled an international group of experts to assess the effects of excess fat on cancer risk.  Recently, they published an overview of their conclusions in The New England Journal of Medicine . Here is a summary of their report.   Background  People’s risk of developing certain types of cancer is largely determined by lifestyle habits, although genetics also play a significant role.  A healthy diet and exercise may reduce the risk of cancer, whereas smoking, excessive alcohol intake and certain types of foods may increase the risk.  For example, the IARC recently concluded that an excessive intake of processed meat increases the risk of cancer .  Article Reviewed  This was a special report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is a part of the World Health Organization.  The report provides a summary of their conclusions regarding the association of cancer risk with overweight and obesity.  Body Fatness and Cancer — Viewpoint of the IARC Working Group.  Study Design  From April 5–12th, 2016, the IARC working group reviewed more than 1,000 studies investigating the links between excess body fat and cancer.  Most of these studies were observational and used body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference when assessing excess body fat.  Their findings were not based on new research. They simply based their conclusions on the most recent or comprehensive studies and meta-analyses available.  Bottom Line: The IARC working group spent a few days reviewing the available evidence, basing their conclusions on the most recent studies and meta-analyses examining the link between obesity and cancer risk.  What Are Overweight and Obesity?  Overweight and obesity are terms used to describe the excessive accumulation of body fat.  They are generally defined using the body mass index (BMI), which is a marker of fat mass. BMI is calculated by dividing body weight (in kilograms) by body height squared (in centimeters).  Using BMI, normal weight, overweight and obesity are defined as follows:   Normal weight: 18.5–24.9.  Overweight: 25.0–29.9.  Obesity, class 1: 30.0–34.9.  Obesity, class 2: 35.0–39.9.  Obesity, class 3: More than 40.   BMI is not an accurate measure of excessive fat, given that it can be skewed by high muscle mass. However, it is easy to measure and an adequate proxy for fat mass on a population level.  Bottom Line: Overweight and obesity are terms used to describe the excessive accumulation of body fat. The basic causes are excessive calorie intake and inactivity.  Does Excessive Fat Mass Increase the Risk of Cancer?  In 2002, the previous IARC working group concluded that there was evidence linking weight gain to an increased risk of five types of cancer.  These included cancers in the colon, esophagus (adenocarcinoma), kidneys (renal cell), breasts (postmenopausal) and the uterus ( 1 ).  The current working group added eight additional cancers to this list, including cancers in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, ovaries, thyroids, brain (meningioma), white blood cells (multiple myeloma) and stomach (gastric cardia).  The charts below show the percentage change in risk for each of these cancers, comparing normal-weight people with those in the highest BMI category studied.    For uterine and esophageal cancers, the researchers compared those in the highest obesity category (BMI above 40) with normal-weight people.  For other cancers, the risk increase was based on a comparison of those in the lowest obesity category (BMI above 30) with normal-weight people. Values marked with an asterisk (*) show the risk increase per 5 BMI units above a BMI of 30.  Bottom Line: Obesity increases the risk of many types of cancer. In severely obese people, the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma increases by 380% and uterine cancer by 610%, compared to normal-weight people.  Why Does Excess Fat Increase Cancer Risk?  In many cases, the excess cancer risk associated with overweight or obesity is due to lifestyle factors.  Overweight and obese people tend to exercise less than normal-weight people. Additionally, their choice of food is often unhealthier ( 2 ).  Obesity is also linked with considerable hormonal and metabolic abnormalities, including chronic inflammation, which may promote the formation of cancer ( 3 , 4 ).  Bottom Line: Unhealthy lifestyle habits and metabolic abnormalities explain why overweight and obese people tend to be at an increased risk of cancer.  Limitations  The main limitation of the reviewed studies is their observational design.  Even though causality cannot be demonstrated, it is clear that some aspects of obesity and the related lifestyle increase the risk of cancer.  Additionally, the observational evidence is consistent across studies and populations and supported by controlled studies in animals.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the IARC working group concluded that there is sufficient evidence linking overweight and obesity with 13 types of cancer in humans. In fact, the risk is even higher than previously thought.  However, the human evidence is mostly based on observational studies, which cannot prove causality. However, it is clear that some metabolic aspects of obesity or the related lifestyle habits are associated with an increased risk of cancer.  Tags: Body fat , Cancer , Obesity

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (August 19th–26th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 26, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Sleeping poorly may increase your risk of weight gain or obesity.  There is hardly any evidence that artificial sweeteners adversely affect blood sugar control or appetite.  When pregnant women eat more protein (relative to carbs) their newborns tend to have less intra-abdominal fat.  Supplementing with folate may improve risk factors for heart disease.  Vitamin D deficiency is associated with erectile dysfunction.    Research Reviews  As usual, we published two reviews this week: one on the association between poor sleep and weight gain and another on a systematic review of studies investigating the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on blood sugar control and appetite.   Review:  Does Poor Sleep Make You Fat?  Article:  Sleep quality and obesity in young subjects: a meta-analysis.  Summary: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the association of sleep quality and overweight or obesity.  The analysis suggests that poor sleep quality, such as broken sleep or difficulties falling asleep, is linked with excessive fat mass. However, the direction of causality is still unclear.   Review:  Are Non-Nutritive Sweeteners an Acceptable Replacement for Sugar?  Article:  Effects of the Non-Nutritive Sweeteners on Glucose Metabolism and Appetite Regulating Hormones: Systematic Review of Observational Prospective Studies and Clinical Trials.  Summary: This was a systematic review of studies examining the association of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), including artificial sweeteners, on blood sugar control and measures of appetite.  Most observational studies and randomized controlled trials suggest that NNS do not affect blood sugar control. However, they may improve blood sugar balance after a meal or drink when compared to sugar.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Men’s Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Greater Healthful Dietary Variety Is Associated with Greater 2-Year Changes in Weight and Adiposity in the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS Lost) Trial.  This observational study found that eating a variety of healthy foods promotes sustained weight loss in overweight or obese individuals on a weight loss program.   Maternal Macronutrient Intake during Pregnancy Is Associated with Neonatal Abdominal Adiposity: The Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) Study.  This observational study in women who were 26–28 weeks pregnant found that a higher protein intake relative to carbs was associated with less intra-abdominal fat in the child.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Metabolic Effects of Monounsaturated Fatty Acid-Enriched Diets Compared With Carbohydrate or Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid-Enriched Diets in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that eating diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids may improve risk factors for metabolic disorders among people with type 2 diabetes.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Metabolically healthy obesity is associated with an increased risk of diabetes independently of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  Some obese people do not have any signs of metabolic disorders, even though they may have a large waist circumference. This type of obesity is sometimes called metabolically healthy obesity (MHO).  This prospective observational study showed that people who were MHO in the beginning were at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on, regardless of whether they had a fatty liver.   4. Heart Health  Almond supplementation reduces serum uric acid in coronary artery disease patients: a randomized controlled trial.  Uric acid is a compound that forms when the body breaks down dietary purines. The kidneys are responsible for removing uric acid from the blood. However, some people may accumulate high levels of uric acid, which is a risk factor for heart disease.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with 10 grams of almonds per day for three months reduced circulating levels of uric acid by 14–18%, compared to those who didn’t eat almonds.   The Effects of Folate Supplementation on Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and Metabolic Status in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome.  The carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) test measures carotid atherosclerotic vascular disease (CAVD). CAVD is when the carotid arteries, which supply the head with blood, narrow and harden. It is a common cause of heart attacks.  This randomized controlled trial in people with metabolic syndrome showed that supplementing with 5 mg per day of folate for 12 weeks significantly reduced CIMT and beneficially affected blood sugar control and blood lipids.   Mediterranean diet score and left ventricular structure and function: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.  The observational study showed that the Mediterranean diet was linked with modest improvements in heart structure and function.   ω-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Coronary Heart Disease.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that blood levels of omega-3 fats were modestly associated with a lower risk of fatal heart disease.   The relationship between the dietary inflammatory index and risk of total cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease: Findings from an Australian population-based prospective cohort study of women.  The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods may be pro-inflammatory, whereas others may be anti-inflammatory or neutral.  This observational study in middle-aged Australian women found no significant association between the DII and heart disease.   The Association of Vitamin D Status with Dyslipidaemia and Biomarkers of Endothelial Cell Activation in Older Australians.  This observational study in older Australians showed that good vitamin D status was linked with an improved blood lipid profile and increased hepatocyte growth factor , which may protect the blood vessels and reduce the risk of heart disease.   Effects of the Mediterranean Diet on Cardiovascular Outcomes—A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of heart disease. However, the available evidence is mixed and limited.   The Association Of Nut Consumption With Cardiovascular Mortality And Coronary Heart Disease Risk In Women.   This observational study in 39,167 women from the Women’s Health Study indicates that eating nuts frequently is not associated with the risk of death from heart disease in healthy women.  However, in an adjusted secondary analysis, nut consumption was associated with a reduced risk of developing heart disease.   Cheese consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.  This meta-analysis of prospective observational studies concluded that cheese consumption is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Eating 40 grams of cheese per day was linked with the lowest risk.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Dietary patterns are associated with depressive symptoms among Chinese adults: a case–control study with propensity score matching.  This observational study in Chinese adults showed that eating a lot of sugar-sweetened food or animal-source foods was associated with an increased risk of depression.  On the other hand, a diet high in fruits, vegetables and soy products was linked to a reduced risk of depressive symptoms.   6. Digestive Health  Fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of cholecystectomy: a prospective cohort study of women and men.  Cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder, a common treatment for gallstones or other complications.  This prospective observational study in adults suggests that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of needing a cholecystectomy in 48–60 year old women. No significant association was detected in men or younger women.   7. Kidney and Urinary Health  DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet and Risk of Subsequent Kidney Disease.  DASH stands for “dietary approaches to stop hypertension.” It’s a dietary pattern designed and promoted by the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  This observational study showed that the DASH diet score was significantly associated with a lower risk of developing kidney disease.   8. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Association of Dietary Fats and Total and Cause-Specific Mortality.  This observational study was based on data from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.  The study showed that replacing 5% of calories from saturated fat with an equivalent amount of calories from unsaturated or polyunsaturated fat was associated with a 27% reduction in untimely mortality (death).   9. Men’s Health  Vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with greater prevalence of erectile dysfunction: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001–2004.  This observational study in US men showed that a vitamin D deficiency was linked to an increased risk of erectile dysfunction (ED). Further studies are needed to investigate whether supplementing with vitamin D improves ED.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Are Non-Nutritive Sweeteners an Acceptable Replacement for Sugar?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 26, 2016  Excessive sugar consumption is suspected to be one of the main causes of obesity.  As a result, some processed foods contain zero-calorie (non-nutritive) sweeteners instead of added sugar.  They are supposed to provide a sweet taste without any of the adverse health effects associated with too much sugar. Nonetheless, their safety is debated.  A recent article summarized the available evidence on the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on glucose metabolism and appetite hormones. Here is a detailed summary.   Article Reviewed  This was a systematic review that included 44 human studies on the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on glucose metabolism and appetite hormones.  Effects of the Non-Nutritive Sweeteners on Glucose Metabolism and Appetite Regulating Hormones: Systematic Review of Observational Prospective Studies and Clinical Trials.  What Are Non-Nutritive Sweeteners?  Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), often referred to as artificial sweeteners, are food additives that imitate the sweet taste of sugar without any calories.  Six NNS are currently approved for use in the US and Europe:   Acesulfame-K.  Advantame.  Aspartame.  Neotame.  Saccharin.  Sucralose.   There is also growing interest in naturally-derived NNS, such as steviol glycosides (stevia) and luo han guo extract.  The following sections summarize the available evidence on the health effects of some of these NNS.  Bottom Line: Non-nutritive sweeteners, most of which are artificial sweeteners, imitate the taste of sugar without any additional calories.  Acesulfame K  Härtel BG, et al. The influence of sweetener solutions on the secretion of insulin and blood glucose level. Ernährungsunschau , 1993.  This crossover study in 14 healthy people compared the effects of 165 mg of acesulfame K mixed in water to water only. Acesulfame K did not affect insulin or blood sugar levels.   Bryant CE, et al. Non-nutritive sweeteners: no class effect on the glycaemic or appetite responses to ingested glucose.  European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2014.  This crossover study in 10 healthy individuals examined the effects of 85 mg of acesulfame K to 45 grams of glucose.  Consuming acesulfame K did not significantly affect glucose or appetite sensations, compared to glucose only.   Steinert RE, et al. Effects of carbohydrate sugars and artificial sweeteners on appetite and the secretion of gastrointestinal satiety peptides.  The British Journal of Nutrition , 2011.  This crossover study in 12 healthy individuals compared the effects of an intragastric infusion to 50 grams of glucose, 25 grams of fructose or 220 mg of acesulfame K.  Acesulfame K did not affect glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY , ghrelin or appetite sensations, compared to water.   Olalde-Mendoza L, et al. Modification of fasting blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus type 2 after regular soda and diet soda intake in the State of Queretaro, Mexico . Archivos Latinoamericanos de Nutricion , 2013.  This randomized trial in 40 people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) showed that drinking 200 ml of diet soda containing a 40 mg mix of aspartame and acesulfame K did not affect glucose levels, compared to a regular soda.   Brown RJ, et al. Effects of diet soda on gut hormones in youths with diabetes.  Diabetes Care , 2012.   This crossover study recruited 9 participants with T1D, 10 with T2D and 25 healthy individuals as a control.  The study showed that drinking 240 ml of a diet soda sweetened with sucralose and acesulfame K increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) by 43% in people with T1D and 34% in healthy individuals.  No effects were seen in participants with T2D. Additionally, the diet soda didn’t affect levels of glucose, C-peptide , gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) or peptide YY.  Bottom Line: Human trials suggest that acesulfame K has no adverse effects on blood sugar control or appetite.  Aspartame   Nehrling JK, et al. Aspartame use by persons with diabetes.  Diabetes Care , 1985.   This study in 62 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) showed that consuming 2.7 grams of aspartame every day for 18 weeks did not affect blood sugar levels or HbA1c , compared to a placebo.   Okuno G, et al. Glucose tolerance, blood lipid, insulin and glucagon concentration after single or continuous administration of aspartame in diabetics.  Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice , 1986.  These were two small crossover trials. The first trial showed that a single 500 mg-dose of aspartame lowered blood sugar 2–3 hours afterward, compared to 100 grams of glucose.  The second study found that consuming 125 mg of aspartame for two weeks had no effects, compared to 50 grams of glucose.  In these studies, aspartame did not significantly affect insulin, glucagon, triglycerides, total cholesterol or HDL cholesterol.   Colagiuri S, et al. Metabolic effects of adding sucrose and aspartame to the diet of subjects with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 1989.   This small study in nine diabetics showed that taking 162 mg of aspartame every day for 6 weeks did not affect glucose, HbA1c, body weight, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides, compared to taking 45 grams of sucrose.   Rodin J. Comparative effects of fructose, aspartame, glucose, and water preloads on calorie and macronutrientintake.  The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 1990.  This crossover trial included 12 overweight and 12 normal-weight adults. On separate visits, the researchers tested the effects of 50 grams of glucose, 50 grams of fructose or 250 mg of aspartame. They also consumed 500 ml of water.  They detected no significant differences in glucose, insulin, glucagon, free fatty acids or calorie intake (at a subsequent lunch) between groups, or compared to water only.   Melanson KJ, et al. Blood glucose and meal patterns in time-blinded males, after aspartame, carbohydrate, and fat consumption, in relation to sweetness perception.  The British Journal of Nutrition , 1999.  This small crossover study in 10 healthy men showed that drinking an aspartame-sweetened beverage reduced blood sugar levels in 40% of the participants, whereas they increased them 20% and remained stable in the rest.  Aspartame did not affect calorie intake at a subsequent meal.   Hall WL, et al. Physiological mechanisms mediating aspartameinduced satiety.  Physiology & Behavior , 2003.  This small crossover trial in six participants investigated the effects of taking either 400 mg of aspartame, 176 mg of aspartic acid combined with 224 mg of phenylalanine or 400 mg of corn flour as a placebo.  The researchers found that levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) were significantly lower after taking either aspartame or the amino acids (aspartic acid and phenylalanine).  However, aspartame did not affect glucose, insulin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), cholecystokinin , gastric emptying or appetite.   Maersk M, et al. Satiety scores and satiety hormone response after sucrose-sweetened soft drink compared with isocaloric semi-skimmed milk and with non-caloric soft drink: a controlled trial.  European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2012.  This crossover study in 24 adults with obesity investigated the effects of drinking a soda sweetened with 500 ml of aspartame.  Consuming an aspartame-sweetened beverage did not affect glucose, insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), appetite sensations, thirst or calorie intake at a buffet four hours afterward.   Härtel BG, et al. The influence of sweetener solutions on the secretion of insulin and blood glucose level. Ernährungsunschau , 1993.  This crossover study in 14 healthy people compared the effects of 165 mg of aspartame to 330 ml of water.

The researchers found no significant differences in the levels of glucose, insulin or glucagon at any point in time.   Temizkan S, et al. Sucralose enhances GLP-1 release and lowers blood glucose in the presence of carbohydrate in healthy subjects but not in patients with type 2 diabetes.  European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2015.  This crossover study included eight people newly diagnosed with T2D and eight healthy people. It compared the effects of consuming 200 ml of water to water combined with 72 mg of aspartame.  Aspartame did not affect glucose, insulin, C-peptide or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), compared to water.  Bottom Line: Aspartame did not adversely affect blood sugar control or appetite. Some studies suggest that aspartame may be useful for diabetics.  Saccharin   Cooper PL, et al. Sucrose versus saccharin as an added sweetener in noninsulin-dependent diabetes: short- and medium-term metabolic effects.  Diabetic Medicine: A Journal of the British Diabetic Association , 1988.  This crossover study in 17 people with non-insulin dependent diabetes showed that taking 30 grams of saccharin combined with starch every day for 6 weeks did not affect glucose, insulin or triglycerides.   Suez J, et al. Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota.  Nature , 2014.   This small trial in seven people showed that taking saccharin (2.3 mg per pound, or 5 mg per kg, of body weight) every day for 6 days, increased blood sugar levels in four of the participants.  When the feces of some of these four participants were transplanted into mice, their blood sugar levels increased as well. However, this study didn’t include a control group and therefore doesn’t prove that saccharin caused these effects.   Härtel BG, et al. The influence of sweetener solutions on the secretion of insulin and blood glucose level. Ernährungsunschau , 1993.  This crossover study in 14 healthy people compared the effects of 75 mg of saccharin to 330 ml of water.  The researchers found that glucose levels were in some cases slightly lower after consuming saccharin, compared to water. However, the differences were not clinically relevant.   Bryant CE, et al. Non-nutritive sweeteners: no class effect on the glycaemic or appetite responses to ingested glucose.  European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2014.  This crossover study in 10 healthy individuals compared the effects of 20 mg of saccharin to 45 grams of glucose.  Consuming saccharin did not significantly affect glucose or appetite sensations, compared to glucose only.   Horwitz DL, et al. Response to single dose of aspartame or saccharin by NIDDM patients.  Diabetes Care , 1988.  This study tested the effects of a beverage sweetened with 135 mg of saccharin to an unsweetened placebo.  Blood samples were taken regularly for three hours after consuming the beverage. The researchers found no significant differences in the levels of glucose, insulin or glucagon at any time point.  Bottom Line: There is limited evidence that saccharin has adverse effects on blood sugar control or appetite. One study suggests that saccharin may increase blood sugar levels by affecting the gut microbiota.  Stevia   Gregersen S, et al. Antihyperglycemic effects of stevioside in type 2 diabetic subjects.  Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental , 2004.  This crossover trial in 12 people with type 2 diabetes showed that 1 gram of stevioside added to a 412 calorie breakfast reduced the rise in blood sugar levels in 18% of the participants.  Stevioside also increased the ratio of insulin to glucose (the insulinogenic index). In contrast, stevioside did not affect insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) or gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP).   Barriocanal LA, et al. Apparent lack of pharmacological effect of steviol glycosides used as sweeteners in humans. A pilot study of repeated exposures in some normotensive and hypotensive individuals and in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology , 2008.   This was a randomized controlled trial in 76 people — 30 with T2D, 16 with T1D and 30 healthy individuals.  It showed that taking 250 mg of steviol glycosides every day for three months did not affect glucose, insulin or HbA1c, compared to a placebo.   Maki KC, et al. Chronic consumption of rebaudioside A, a steviol glycoside, in men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Food and Chemical Toxicology: An International Journal Published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association , 2008.  This randomized controlled trial in 122 people with diabetes examined the health effects of taking 1000 mg of rebaudioside A (a steviol glycoside) for four months.  The study showed that rebaudioside A did not affect glucose, insulin, HbA1c, C-peptide, body weight, blood pressure or blood lipids.   Anton SD, et al. Effects of stevia, aspartame, and sucrose on food intake, satiety, and postprandial glucose and insulin levels.  Appetite , 2010.   This crossover study in 19 normal-weight and 12 obese adults examined the acute effects of tea sweetened with sucrose, stevia or aspartame. The quantity of each sweetener was not specified.  Stevia reduced glucose and insulin levels, compared to sucrose. In contrast, there were no significant differences in hunger, satiety or fullness at a subsequent meal.  Bottom Line: Stevia may have benefits for blood sugar control, and there is no evidence of any harmful effects.  Sucralose  Mezitis NH, et al. Glycemic effect of a single high oral dose of the novel sweetener sucralose in patients with diabetes.  Diabetes Care , 1996.  This crossover study included 13 people with type 1 diabetes and 13 with type 2 diabetes. On two separate visits, the participants took a single 1000 mg capsule of sucralose or a placebo, followed by a standard liquid breakfast.  Sucralose did not affect the levels of blood sugar or C-peptide for four hours afterward, compared to a placebo.   Grotz VL, et al. Lack of effect of sucralose on glucose homeostasis in subjects with type 2 diabetes.  Journal of the American Dietetic Association , 2003.

Effects of oral ingestion of sucralose on gut hormone response and appetite in healthy normal-weight subjects.  European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2011.  This small crossover study in eight healthy individuals examined the acute effects of 50 ml of water, sucralose or maltodextrin combined with sucralose.  Sucralose did not affect glucose, insulin, GLP-1, peptide YY, food intake, appetite or brain responses, compared to a placebo.   Brown AW, et al. Short-term consumption of sucralose, a nonnutritive sweetener, is similar to water with regard to select markers of hunger signaling and short-term glucose homeostasis in women.

Wu T, et al. Effects of different sweet preloads on incretin hormone secretion, gastric emptying, and postprandial glycemia in healthy humans.  The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2012.  This crossover study in 10 healthy individuals showed that consuming 60 mg of sucralose did not affect glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) or gastric emptying, compared to 40 grams of glucose.   Pepino MY, et al. Sucralose affects glycemic and hormonal responses to an oral glucose load.  Diabetes Care , 2013.   This study in morbidly obese people showed that 48 mg of sucralose increased blood sugar and insulin levels and impaired insulin sensitivity by 23%.

Effects of carbohydrate sugars and artificial sweeteners on appetite and the secretion of gastrointestinal satiety peptides.  The British Journal of Nutrition , 2011.  This crossover study in 12 healthy individuals compared the effects of an intragastric infusion of 50 grams of glucose, 25 grams of fructose or 62 mg of sucralose.  Sucralose did not affect glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY, ghrelin or appetite sensations, compared to water.   Temizkan S, et al. Sucralose enhances GLP-1 release and lowers blood glucose in the presence of carbohydrate in healthy subjects but not in patients with type 2 diabetes.  European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2015.  This crossover study included eight people newly diagnosed with T2D and eight healthy people. It compared the effects of consuming 200 ml of water to water combined with 24 mg of sucralose.  The researchers found that sucralose lowered glucose levels and increased glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in healthy participants, compared to water. In contrast, sucralose did not affect insulin and C-peptide.  Bottom Line: There is no solid evidence that sucralose adversely affects blood sugar control or appetite. One study showed that sucralose impaired insulin sensitivity in severely obese people.  Observational Studies on the Total Intake of Non-Nutritive Sweeteners  Several observational studies have investigated the association of total non-nutritive sweetener intake (NNS) with metabolic disorders, mainly type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here are summaries of their results.   One report using data from a study including more than 70,000 women showed that a high intake of caffeinated, artificially sweetened beverages was associated with an increased risk of T2D ( 1 ).  However, this association was lost when the researchers adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and calorie intake. In other words, those who consumed the most NNS from caffeinated beverages had a higher BMI, explaining the links with T2D.   In another study based on data from the Nurses Health Study II, researchers found no significant association between NNS intake and T2D ( 2 ).   Similar studies have also investigated this association in men.  Data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, including more than 40,000 men, showed that a high intake of NNS was significantly linked with an increased risk of T2D, but the association was lost after an adjustment for BMI ( 3 ).   The largest observational study examining the link between total NNS intake and T2D was the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. It was conducted in eight countries and included 340,234 subjects ( 4 ).  The study reported a significant association between NNS intake and T2D. But once again, this link was lost after an adjustment for BMI and calorie intake.   Several other smaller observational studies have investigated the links between NNS intake and metabolic disease.  The Black Women’s Health Study, which included 43,960 African American women, found no significant links between NNS intake and T2D ( 5 ).   Three studies showed that a high intake of NNS was associated with metabolic syndrome. However, they didn’t take BMI or fat mass into account ( 6 , 7 , 8 ).   One study found that drinking a lot of diet soda was linked with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and T2D.  Again, the association with metabolic syndrome was lost after adjusting for BMI and waist circumference. However, while the link to T2D weakened after adjustment, it remained significant ( 9 ).   Another study in 66,118 French female teachers showed that drinking more than 20 oz of artificially sweetened beverages per week was linked with a higher risk of T2D, even after adjusting for BMI ( 10 ).   Among 2,337 Japanese factory workers, consuming one or more servings of diet soda per week was associated with a higher risk of T2D, compared to those who didn’t drink diet soda ( 11 ).  The association remained significant after adjusting for multiple variables.   In the EPIC-Norfolk Study, which included 24,653 adults, drinking more than 336 g of artificially sweetened beverages per day was associated with an increased risk of T2D ( 12 ).  However, this link was lost after adjusting for BMI and waist circumference.   Other studies looked at the links between obesity and NNS intake. They showed that obese people and those gaining weight were more likely to consume artificially sweetened beverages ( 13 ).   Two meta-analyses have examined the connection between drinking artificially sweetened beverages and T2D.  One analysis included four studies with healthy participants. It reported that drinking 330 ml of artificially sweetened beverages a day increased the risk of T2D.  However, the relative risk (RR) was small or only 1.13. In other words, those who consumed 330 ml of artificially sweetened beverages per day were only 1.13 times more likely to develop TD2, compared to those who didn’t consume them ( 14 ).  Another analysis included 10 studies. It found artificial sweeteners increased the risk of T2D (RR = 1.48). However, the association was lost after adjusting for BMI ( 15 ).  Bottom Line: Studies indicate people who consume NNS are at an increased risk of metabolic disease, but the link is usually lost after adjusting for fat mass.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Although some observational studies show a significant link between high intakes of NNS and type 2 diabetes, the association is generally lost after an adjustment for fat mass or BMI.  People who are overweight or obese and at risk of developing diabetes or metabolic disorders have a tendency to choose diet sodas sweetened with zero-calorie sweeteners. This likely explains the findings of many observational studies.  Accordingly, the majority of randomized controlled trials have not found any signs of adverse effects. However, many trials are small and flawed in design.  One study found that sucralose reduced insulin sensitivity in morbidly obese individuals. Further trials need to confirm its findings.  Additionally, a few trials found that artificial sweeteners lowered blood sugar or insulin levels, compared to sugar, which benefits people with poor blood sugar control.  Taken together, there is currently no strong evidence linking non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) with adverse changes in glucose metabolism or appetite in humans when they are eaten in acceptable amounts.

	Does Poor Sleep Make You Fat?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 22, 2016  Most people know that adequate sleep is one of the cornerstones of good health. But is poor sleep bad for your waistline?  A recent meta-analysis examined the association of sleep quality and overweight and obesity in young people. Here is a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  Many previous studies suggest that inadequate sleep makes people more likely to gain weight ( 1 , 2 ).  However, most of them have investigated sleep duration rather than quality ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).  As opposed to sleep duration, sleep quality is more about the personal experience of sleep, such as difficulties falling asleep or sleep satisfaction. Broken sleep is also an aspect of sleep quality ( 6 ).  Some observational studies indicate that light pollution at night might promote weight gain by disrupting sleep.  However, until now, no meta-analyses have examined the association of sleep quality and overweight or obesity.  Article Reviewed  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis on the association of sleep quality and overweight and obesity.  Sleep quality and obesity in young subjects: a meta-analysis.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.  Its purpose was to examine the association of sleep quality and overweight and obesity in young people and find out if the association is independent of sleep duration.  The researchers selected nine observational studies for the meta-analysis, including a total of 26,553 children, adolescents and young adults.  Most of the included studies had a cross-sectional design, meaning that they examined the association at one point in time. In other words, they didn’t investigate the effect of poor quality sleep on weight changes over time.  Studies were excluded if they didn’t include body mass index as an outcome or the participants had medical or psychological problems.  Additionally, studies were left out if they only focused on sleep duration or all of the participants were overweight or obese.  Poor sleep quality was defined as difficulties falling asleep and sleep disturbances (recurrent awakenings).  Some of the studies assessed sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire, both of which evaluate sleep duration and quality.  Bottom Line: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the association of sleep quality and overweight or obesity.  Finding: Poor Sleep Quality Was Associated With Overweight and Obesity  This meta-analysis suggests that both short sleep duration and poor sleep quality makes young people more likely to be overweight or obese.  The association of sleep quality and overweight or obesity seemed to be independent of sleep duration ( 7 , 8 ).  Most of the included studies found that inadequate sleep was significantly associated with overweight and obesity.  However, the studies that used non-validated research methods provided mixed results ( 7 , 9 , 10 ).  Most of the included studies were cross-sectional, measuring associations at one point in time. In contrast, only two of the studies were longitudinal, measuring sleep quality and changes in weight over time.  The longitudinal studies found no significant links between sleep quality and overweight or obesity ( 9 , 11 ).  Bottom Line: The study suggests that poor sleep quality is associated with overweight and obesity in young people, independently of sleep duration.  How Could Low Sleep Quality Make People Fat?  Although this study didn’t prove that poor sleep quality may lead to fat gain, it seems plausible that it might.  The potential mechanisms are unclear, but scientists have a few ideas.   Disrupted body clock: The body’s timekeeping system regulates many aspects of metabolism. Disrupting this system by sleeping irregularly or poorly may promote weight gain ( 12 , 13 ).  Increased appetite: Irregular or low-quality sleep can disrupt the 24-hour fluctuations in appetite hormones, promoting increased calorie intake during the day and at night ( 14 ).  Food intake at night: Broken sleep or difficulties falling asleep may encourage night-time eating, potentially leading to weight gain over time.   Bottom Line: Several plausible ideas explain how poor sleep might promote weight gain. For example, low sleep quality may disrupt the body clock and encourage night-time snacking.  Limitations  This study had a few important limitations.  First, all of the included studies had an observational design, and all but three were cross-sectional. This means that they couldn’t prove causality and didn’t show that poor sleep was linked with weight gain over time.  It’s plausible that being overweight or obese may reduce sleep quality, rather than the other way around.  Second, only three studies measured sleep quality, using actigraphy . Additionally, most of the included studies used validated questionnaires, whereas three relied on parental or self-reporting.  Finally, most of the studies used body mass index (BMI) as an outcome. Four of the studies used self-reported height and weight for calculating BMI. BMI is an inaccurate measure of overweight, especially when relying on self-reports.  Bottom Line: The meta-analysis included observational studies, which cannot prove a causal relationship. Additionally, most of the studies relied on inaccurate measurements.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study indicates that poor sleep quality â broken sleep or difficulties falling asleep â are associated with excessive fat mass.  However, the evidence is weak, and the direction of causality is unclear. Obesity, overweight or related factors are plausibly responsible for poor sleep quality, at least in some cases.  Regardless, there is no doubt that getting high-quality sleep is important for maintaining a healthy mind and body.  Tags: Obesity , Overweight , Sleep

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (August 12th–19th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 19, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Medium-chain triglycerides and CLA may suppress appetite and calorie intake.  High dietary salt intake raises blood pressure in salt-sensitive individuals.  Drinking cocoa may suppress appetite if it contains enough epicatechin.  High caffeine consumption is associated with shorter sleep duration and poor sleep quality.  Not drinking enough water impairs mental performance and increases anxiety and depression.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two articles: one examining the effects of medium-chain triglycerides and CLA on appetite and calorie intake and another discussing salt sensitivity.   Review:  MCTs and CLA: Fats That Reduce Calorie Intake.   Article:  Medium-chain triglycerides and conjugated linoleic acids in beverage form increase satiety and reduce food intake in humans.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of supplementing with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) at breakfast on subsequent calorie intake and appetite.  The study showed that CLA and MCTs significantly reduced calorie intake later in the day, compared to vegetable oil. However, it is unclear to what extent these effects are maintained in the long term.   Review:  Salt Sensitivity — Does It Matter?  Article:  Salt Sensitivity of Blood Pressure. A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.  Summary: This was a scientific review on the available evidence regarding salt sensitivity.  The review concluded that eating a lot of salt raises blood pressure in salt-sensitive individuals, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Arthritis  Sleep    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Impact of Breakfast Skipping and Breakfast Choice on the Nutrient Intake and Body Mass Index of Australian Children.  This observational study in Australian children showed that those who regularly consumed breakfast were less likely to be overweight. However, eating breakfast was not significantly linked to mean body mass index.  Eating breakfast was also associated with a higher intake of many nutrients, especially among those who consumed cereal for breakfast. Cereal consumers had higher intakes of fiber, calcium, iron and folate, but also carbs and sugar.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Frequent Consumption of Sugar- and Artificially Sweetened Beverages and Natural and Bottled Fruit Juices Is Associated with an Increased Risk of Metabolic Syndrome in a Mediterranean Population at High Cardiovascular Disease Risk.  This observational study suggests that drinking more than five servings of sugar-sweetened beverages or bottled fruit juices per week is linked to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Serum calcium and incident type 2 diabetes: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.   Previous studies suggest that elevated circulating levels of calcium are associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes.  This observational study in 12,800 adults supports previous findings, showing that high calcium levels were linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.   Zinc status, dietary zinc intake and metabolic risk in Australian children and adolescents; Nepean Longitudinal Study.  This observational study in Australian children and adolescents showed that those who had low circulating zinc levels were at a greater risk of elevated insulin (at 15 years old) and blood sugar (at 8 years old).   Therapeutic potential of green tea on risk factors for type 2 diabetes in obese adults – a review.  This review discussed the effectiveness of green tea and green tea antioxidants, such as epigallocatechin gallate, at treating type 2 diabetes, obesity and metabolic disorders.  The authors concluded that although green tea could potentially treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, further studies are needed before any strong claims can be made.   The Effects of Soy Isoflavones on Metabolic Status of Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.  Isoflavones are a class of polyphenol antioxidants found in soybeans. This randomized controlled trial in 70 women with polycystic ovary syndrome examined the health effects of supplementing with 50 mg of isoflavones per day for 3 months.  The study showed that supplementing with isoflavones improved markers of insulin resistance and oxidative stress. It also improved the blood lipid profile (triglyceride levels) and hormonal status.   4. Heart Health  The association between dairy product intake and cardiovascular disease mortality in Chinese adults.  This observational study in Chinese adults showed that higher dairy intake was associated with a reduced risk of death from stroke among those who consumed low amounts of dairy, especially in men.  However, for those with a previous history of heart disease, there were no significant links between dairy intake and death from stroke or any other type of cardiovascular disease.   Habitual intake of anthocyanins and flavanones and risk of cardiovascular disease in men.  Flavonoids are a large group of antioxidants found in fruit, vegetables and other plant foods.  This observational study in men found that a higher intake of flavonoids from fruits was linked to a reduced risk of non-fatal heart attacks and strokes.   The relationship between vitamin K and peripheral arterial disease.  High intakes of vitamin K are thought to reduce heart disease risk by decreasing the calcification of blood vessels. Blood vessel calcification may lead to peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which may reduce blood flow to the limbs and head.  This observational study showed that high intakes of vitamin K2 (menaquinones) were associated with a reduced risk of PAD among those who had elevated blood pressure. In contrast, vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) was not linked to a lower risk.   The Effect of High Dose Cholecalciferol on Arterial Stiffness and Peripheral and Central Blood Pressure in Healthy Humans: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  Cholecalciferol, also known as vitamin D3, is one of two types of dietary vitamin D. It comes from animal sources, whereas ergocalciferol, also known as vitamin D2, is found in plants.  This randomized controlled trial in 40 healthy adults found that supplementing with 3,000 IU per day of cholecalciferol for 4 months did not affect blood pressure or arterial stiffness, which are risk factors for heart disease.   5. Cancer  Sweet-beverage consumption and risk of pancreatic cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.  Sweetened beverages include sugar-sweetened or artificially sweetened soft drinks, as well as fruit juice.  This large observational study in 477,199 men and women showed that a high intake of soft drinks was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. In contrast, high consumption of juice and nectar were linked to a reduced risk.   Lycopene Consumption and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.  Lycopene is an antioxidant carotenoid found in high amounts in tomatoes, guavas and watermelons. Some observational studies suggest that lycopene may reduce the risk of colon cancer, but the evidence is mixed.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies found no significant association of lycopene intake with colorectal cancer.   Dietary Inflammatory Index and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: A Case-Control Study in Korea.  The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) is a measure of the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods may be pro-inflammatory, whereas others may be anti-inflammatory or neutral.  This observational study in Korean adults found that the pro-inflammatory potential of a diet was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.   6. Appetite and Eating  Epicatechin, procyanidins, cocoa, and appetite: a randomized controlled trial.  Previous trials have shown that eating dark chocolate reduces appetite, compared to a placebo. However, this randomized crossover trial in 28 healthy men suggests that drinking cocoa doesn’t always decrease subsequent food intake.  It was only when the cocoa mixture contained higher amounts of epicatechin that it reduced food intake by 18.7%. This indicates that epicatechin may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effects.   7. Brain and Mental Health  The impact of caffeine use across the lifespan on cognitive performance in elderly women.  Many previous observational studies suggest that regularly consuming caffeine may protect against an age-related decline in mental function (cognitive decline).  However, this observational study in older women (56–83 years old) found no significant association between current or previous caffeine intake and mental performance.   Minor degree of hypohydration adversely influences cognition: a mediator analysis.  This trial tested the effects of drinking water on mental performance. The participants spent four hours in a room with a temperature of 86°C (30°C) and either did or didn’t drink water.  The study showed that drinking 10.1 oz (300 ml) of water improved memory and attention. Thirst was also associated with increased anxiety and depression.   Effect of Probiotics on Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  Probiotics are bacteria that benefit health when consumed. They are found in some fermented food products, as well as dietary supplements.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplementing with probiotics may reduce depression.   8. Arthritis  Chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine sulfate shows no superiority over placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with knee osteoarthritis.  Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and glucosamine sulfate (GS) are common dietary supplements that are supposed to help reduce the symptoms and progression of osteoarthritis.  This randomized controlled trial in 164 patients with knee osteoarthritis showed that supplementing with CS (1,200 mg) and GS (1,500 mg) daily for six months did not affect joint pain or function, compared to a placebo.   9. Sleep  Caffeine Consumption and Sleep Quality in Australian Adults.  This observational study in Australian adults suggests that those who consume the most caffeine have shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Salt Sensitivity — Does It Matter?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 17, 2016  For decades, scientists have suspected that excessive salt intake may cause elevated blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease.  However, studies have provided mixed results, partly because people’s blood pressure responds to salt intake in different ways. Those who are prone to hypertension when eating too much salt are referred to as being salt sensitive.  Recently, the American Heart Association published a comprehensive review of the available evidence on salt sensitivity. Here is a summary of the review’s main points.   Article Reviewed  This was a review of the available evidence regarding salt sensitivity.  Salt Sensitivity of Blood Pressure. A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.  What Is Salt Sensitivity?  Salt sensitivity is a measure of how blood pressure responds to changes in dietary salt intake.  The way people’s blood pressure responds to salt intake differs. As a result, not everyone is salt sensitive.  Salt sensitivity is difficult to accurately measure. Additionally, salt sensitivity is not a static variable, and the limit above which people are considered salt sensitive differs depending the definition used.  However, most people who are hypertensive are also salt sensitive, especially when their blood pressure is very high ( 1 ).  The physiological mechanisms behind salt sensitivity are incompletely understood. It’s likely that salt sensitivity is caused by abnormalities in the regulation of sodium balance.  One recent study showed that the excretion of excess sodium from the body (in urine) fluctuates according to a 7-day rhythm and is entirely independent of sodium intake ( 2 ).  It is possible that disruptions of this natural rhythm may have something to do with salt sensitivity, but further studies are needed.  Bottom Line: Salt sensitivity is a measure of how blood pressure changes in response to the dietary intake of salt (sodium).  Why Is Salt Sensitivity Important?  Studies have shown that being salt sensitive is a risk factor for heart disease, independently of blood pressure ( 3 , 4 ).  There is currently no cure for salt sensitivity itself. However, salt-sensitive individuals may need to take anti-hypertensive medication or limit their dietary salt intake.  The salt intake of most Americans exceeds the recommendations of 3,750–5,750 mg of salt (1,500–2,300 mg of sodium) per day ( 5 , 6 ).  For those who are salt sensitive, sticking to these recommendations might reduce the risk of hypertension and heart disease ( 7 ).  However, some observational studies suggest there is a J-shaped association between salt intake and heart disease. Both too little and too much salt may be harmful ( 8 ).  Additionally, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials suggest that salt restriction causes only a mild reduction in blood pressure, and some even conclude that salt intake does not significantly affect heart disease risk ( 9 , 10 ).  These findings were based on averages, and the studies didn’t differentiate between salt sensitive and insensitive individuals. Randomized controlled trials comparing salt sensitive and insensitive individuals are needed.  Many observational studies also provide inconsistent results. Individual differences, as well as methodological weaknesses, may be to blame for the controversy.  Bottom Line: Studies on whole populations provide conflicting results regarding the association of salt intake and heart disease risk. However, limiting salt intake is probably important for those who are salt sensitive.  What Causes Salt Sensitivity?  Not everyone is sensitive to salt intake. It depends on the following factors:   Genes: Salt sensitivity depends on people’s genetics. Multiple genes seem to be involved.  Race: Black people are more likely to be salt sensitive, compared to white people ( 11 ).  Age: The blood pressure of older people is more likely to respond to changes in salt intake, compared to young people ( 12 ).  Gender: Some studies indicate that women are at a greater risk of being salt sensitive than men, but the evidence is inconsistent ( 13 ).  Hypertension: Those who are hypertensive are more likely to be salt sensitive than people with normal blood pressure ( 14 ).  Low potassium intake: People’s salt sensitivity is greater when their potassium intake is low ( 15 , 16 ).   Bottom Line: People’s sensitivity to salt intake mainly depends on genetic factors. Old age and low potassium intake may also increase the risk.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This review concluded that a high salt intake may result in elevated blood pressure (hypertension) among those who are salt sensitive.  On the other hand, those who are not salt sensitive do not develop hypertension from eating too much salt, although a very high intake may still be unhealthy.  Salt sensitivity is usually associated with hypertension. If your blood pressure is too high, you may benefit from reducing your intake of salted food.  Tags: Heart disease , Hypertension , Salt

	MCTs and CLA: Fats That Reduce Calorie Intake  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 15, 2016  How quickly you become hungry after eating not only depends on how much you ate, it also depends on what you ate. Some foods are more filling or satiating than others.  A recent study compared the effects of two types of fat â conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) â on subsequent appetite and calorie intake.  Here is a detailed summary of its findings, as well as some background information.   Background  Fat is the most calorie-rich nutrient you can find, providing 9 kcal for each gram, exceeding protein and carbs by 5 kcal.  However, fat isn’t necessarily fattening. It all depends on how much you eat, the dietary context and the type of fat.  In fact, some types of fat seem to promote the loss of excess weight. This includes conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs).  Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)  CLA is a type of fat found in the milk and meat of ruminant animals, such as sheep and cows.  Supplementing with CLA is believed to benefit those who wish to lose excess fat. This is supported by a few human trials. However, the effects are small, and the clinical relevance is unclear ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ).  One trial showed that CLA may reduce appetite, while other studies have detected no effects ( 5 , 6 , 7 ).  However, its effects on calorie intake in humans have not been investigated before.  Medium-chain Triglycerides (MCTs)  MCTs are a type of fat mainly found in palm oil, coconut oil, milk fat or supplements. They are more water-soluble and are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream after a meal.  Compared to long-chain triglycerides (LCT), MCTs may reduce appetite, calorie intake and promote weight loss ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  This is likely because MCTs are a more readily available calorie source than LCT ( 12 ).  However, not all studies agree. Some studies found that supplementing with MCTs did not affect appetite ( 13 , 14 ).  Article Reviewed  This study tested the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) on appetite and calorie intake.  Medium-chain triglycerides and conjugated linoleic acids in beverage form increase satiety and reduce food intake in humans.  Study Design  This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of different types of fat on appetite and calorie intake.  A total of 19 healthy men and women participated in the study. They were assigned to three test breakfasts on separate days in a random order.  All three breakfasts consisted of 250 ml of a Tesco red berries smoothie (123 kcal), providing 0.8 grams of protein and 29.8 grams of carbs (91% sugar).  Added to the smoothie were 193 kcal of fat, but the type of fat differed between the three breakfasts:   Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA): 5 grams of CLA and 16 grams of vegetable oil.  Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs): 25 grams.  Control: 22 grams of vegetable oil (unspecified).   After breakfast the participants were told to request a sandwich buffet lunch when they felt hungry enough.  The researchers measured calorie intake at the sandwich lunch. Weighed food diaries were also used to assess food intake for the rest of the day.  They also measured the time between the breakfast and self-requested lunch and assessed appetite using visual analogue scale questionnaires.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of supplementing with MCTs and CLA at breakfast on calorie intake and appetite for the rest of the day.  Finding: CLA and MCTs Reduced Calorie Intake  Supplementing with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) or medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) for breakfast resulted in a similar calorie intake at the lunch buffet, compared to supplementing with vegetable oil.  However, calorie intake for the rest of the day (after lunch) was significantly reduced after the participants had supplemented with CLA or MCTs for breakfast, as shown in the chart below.   Supplementing with CLA for breakfast also delayed the time until the participants requested the lunch buffet. Yet, the researchers detected no significant differences in appetite ratings.  Bottom Line: Eating CLA or MCTs at breakfast reduced calorie intake by roughly 500 kcal for the rest of the day.  Limitations  The study’s design doesn’t seem to have had any major flaws, but several limitations should be mentioned.  First, the lunch buffet didn’t have a fixed time. The participants asked for it when they felt hungry enough.  Although this probably didn’t change the study’s overall findings, it probably explains why the researchers didn’t detect any between-group differences in calorie intake at lunch.  Second, calorie intake after lunch was estimated using food diaries, which are often inaccurate. However, this is unlikely to have affected the main results.  Third, five participants reported adverse digestive symptoms after supplementing with MCTs. This discomfort might have reduced their appetite and calorie intake later in the day.  In comparison, only one participant reported digestive discomfort after supplementing with CLA, and there were no adverse symptoms after consuming the control breakfast.  Finally, the calorie content of the two test lipids did not match. The amount of CLA used was 5 grams, whereas the dose of MCTs was 25 grams. As a result, the study didn’t provide an equal comparison of CLA and MCTs.  Bottom Line: The study didn’t have any major limitations to its design. However, there are some limitations to how its results can be interpreted.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that supplementing with CLA or MCTs for breakfast significantly reduced calorie intake for the rest of the day, compared to vegetable oil.  The reduction in calorie intake amounted to approximately 500 kcal. This calorie reduction should result in considerable weight loss over time, but it is unclear to what extent these effects are sustained when CLA or MCTs are taken regularly.  Some previous studies have indicated that supplementing with MCTs or CLA may help people lose excess weight, although the relevance is still debated ( 4 , 15 ).

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (August 5th–12th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 12, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Eating hot chili peppers with meals may promote weight loss.  High-dose omega-3 supplementation improves recovery after a heart attack.  Supplementing with resveratrol may improve brain blood flow and mental performance in diabetics.  Soy isoflavones may improve bone health in postmenopausal women.  Supplementing with monacolin K from red yeast rice improves the blood lipid profile.    Research Reviews   Review:  Can Chili Peppers Help You Lose Weight?  Article:  Capsaicinoids: a spicy solution to the management of obesity?  Summary: This was a review on the potential weight loss benefits of chili peppers and capsaicin, a compound responsible for their pungent, hot taste.  The review concluded that capsaicin increases the amount of calories burned after meals and suppresses appetite. These effects promote weight loss, but randomized controlled trials need to confirm the actual weight loss benefits.   Review:  Omega-3 Reduces the Damage Caused by Heart Attacks.  Article:  Effect of Omega-3 Acid Ethyl Esters on Left Ventricular Remodeling After Acute Myocardial Infarction. The OMEGA-REMODEL Randomized Clinical Trial.  Summary: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the benefits of high-dose omega-3 supplementation (4 grams per day) on heart recovery after a heart attack.  The study showed that supplementing with omega-3 significantly reduced heart tissue scarring and inflammation, reducing the risk of heart failure.   New Research from around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Infections and Immune Health    1. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effect of vitamin D replacement on indexes of insulin resistance in overweight elderly individuals: a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in overweight, elderly people (69% with prediabetes) showed that supplementing with 600 or 3,750 IU of vitamin D per day did not improve insulin resistance.   Vitamin D supplementation reduces insulin resistance in Japanese adults: a secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in healthy Japanese adults showed that supplementing with 420 IU of vitamin D per day for one year significantly reduced fasting blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.   2. Heart Health  The Association of Calcium Supplementation and Incident Cardiovascular Events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).  This observational study suggests that supplementing with calcium does not affect heart disease risk.   Short-term high-fat diet alters postprandial glucose metabolism and circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in healthy males.  This small study compared the short-term (three-day) effects of three different diets that varied in fat, while keeping the amount of calories constant. In these diets, fat provided 25, 50 and 75% of total calories.  The study found that a high-fat diet (75% fat) increased blood sugar levels after a meal, compared to the low-fat diet (25%). It also increased the levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), which may raise the risk of heart disease.   Effects of a dietary strawberry powder on parameters of vascular health in adolescent males.  This study in overweight or obese adolescent boys showed that supplementing with 50 grams of strawberry powder per day for one week did not change circulating nitrate/nitrite levels.  However, strawberry powder appeared to improve blood vessel function in some of the heavier participants. These findings suggest that strawberry powder may reduce the risk of heart disease in some individuals.   LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of monacolin K from red yeast rice extract – results of a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study.  Monacolin K is a compound found in red yeast rice, a traditional Japanese food product made by fermenting rice with a type of red mold.  This randomized controlled trial in people with high cholesterol levels showed that supplementing with folic acid (200 μg/day) and monacolin K (3 mg/day) for three months significantly improved the blood lipid profile.   Effects of matched weight loss from calorie restriction, exercise, or both on cardiovascular disease risk factors: a randomized intervention trial.  Endurance exercise (EE) and calorie restriction (CR) can improve heart health. However, it is unclear whether their effects on heart disease risk are additive when weight loss is matched.  This randomized controlled trial in overweight, sedentary men and women showed that EE and CR, combined or alone, caused similar reductions in markers of heart disease when weight loss was matched.   3. Appetite and Eating  Putting on weight stigma: A randomized study of the effects of wearing a fat suit on eating, well-being, and cortisol.  Overweight and obese people are sometimes frowned upon. This form of social devaluation is known as weight stigma. It is a source of anxiety for many people, but not all obese people experience it.  This study examined the psychological impact of making people appear fat by wearing a fat suit. It made people eat more unhealthy foods, and they reported some negative effects. However, their stress levels did not appear to change.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Acute Resveratrol Consumption Improves Neurovascular Coupling Capacity in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Resveratrol is a compound found in many plants, including grapes and blueberries. Single doses of resveratrol have been shown to increase blood flow in the brain.  Poor blood flow may contribute to mental decline in diabetics. This study showed that a single, 75 mg-dose of resveratrol improved mental performance and neurovascular coupling capacity, which is a marker of blood flow in the brain.   Mediterranean diet, micronutrients and macronutrients, and MRI measures of cortical thickness.  Cortical thickness refers to the size of the cerebral cortex, a part of the brain that plays a major role in thought, memory, attention, awareness and consciousness.  This observational study in elderly people found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with a greater cortical thickness.   5. Digestive Health  Zinc carnosine works with bovine colostrum in truncating heavy exercise-induced increase in gut permeability in healthy volunteers.  Intense exercise may cause gut symptoms. In some cases, it may also lead to a heat stroke believed to be caused by increased intestinal permeability to toxins.  This study showed that supplementing with zinc carnosine (ZC) — either alone or in combination with colostrum — strengthened the intestinal lining and reduced adverse effects. The benefits were greatest when both colostrum and ZC were taken together.   6. Kidney and Urinary Health  Diets higher in animal and plant protein are associated with lower adiposity and do not impair kidney function in US adults.  This observational study showed that diets high in protein were associated with a reduced risk of overweight and obesity. Additionally, high protein intake did not seem to impair markers of kidney function.   7. Bone Health  Soy Reduces Bone Turnover Markers in Women During Early Menopause – a Randomized Controlled Trial.  Decreases in estrogens levels during menopause lead to increased bone loss, contributing to osteoporosis and an elevated risk of bone fractures.  This randomized controlled trial in women undergoing menopause showed that supplementing with 66 mg of soy isoflavones per day for 6 months improved bone formation, blood pressure and blood sugar control.   Soluble corn fiber increases bone calcium retention in postmenopausal women in a dose-dependent manner: a randomized crossover trial.  This small, randomized crossover trial in healthy, postmenopausal women suggests that supplementing with 10–20 grams of soluble corn fiber per day may improve bone health (bone calcium retention), potentially reducing the risk of osteoporosis.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Relation between mealtime distribution of protein intake and lean mass loss in free-living older adults of the NuAge study.  Muscle mass naturally declines with age. However, this loss can be minimized with adequate protein intake and strength exercises.  However, this observational study in older people (67–87 years old) suggests that protein intake is not independently associated with lean mass loss. Yet, lean mass was higher among those whose protein intake was more evenly distributed.   9. Infections and Immune Health  Application of Glutamine-enriched nutrition therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  This study in children with leukemia suggests that supplementing with the amino acid glutamine may improve their nutritional status and immune function.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Omega-3 Reduces the Damage Caused by Heart Attacks  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 10, 2016  The health benefits of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids â docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) â are well known.  One large trial in patients with heart disease showed that supplementing with 1 gram of omega-3 per day reduced their risk of death by 20%. However, not all studies agree ( 1 , 2 ).  Recently, a large randomized controlled trial examined whether supplementing with 4 grams of omega-3 would help repair some of the damage caused by a heart attack. Below is a detailed summary of its findings.   Article Reviewed  This study examined the benefits of high-dose omega-3 supplementation on heart recovery after a heart attack.  Effect of Omega-3 Acid Ethyl Esters on Left Ventricular Remodeling After Acute Myocardial Infarction. The OMEGA-REMODEL Randomized Clinical Trial.  Study Design  This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on changes in heart function and structure during the first 6 months after a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction).  A total of 358 participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups 14 to 28 days after they had a heart attack:   Omega-3: The participants received high-dose omega-3 supplements from fish oil (4 grams per day for 6 months). The supplement contained ethyl esters of EPA (465 mg) and DHA (375 mg).  Placebo: The control capsules contained corn oil, providing 600 mg of omega-6 linoleic acid.   During the study, all of the participants were also receiving standard medical therapy to treat heart disease.  At the start and end of the study, the researchers measured heart structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. They also measured several markers of inflammation and cardiac fibrosis .  Bottom Line: This was a large randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of high-dose omega-3 supplementation on changes in heart structure and function after a heart attack.  Finding 1: Omega-3 Supplements Improved Heart Function  Left ventricular systolic volume index (LVSVI) is a marker of the heart’s ability to pump blood.  The researchers discovered that high-dose omega-3 supplementation reduced LVSVI by 5.8%, compared to a placebo. This is a beneficial change, indicating improved heart function.  The chart below shows the changes in LVSVI in both groups:   There was a dose-response relationship between these benefits and increases in the omega-3 content of red blood cells (RBC).  Among those participants who achieved the highest increase in the omega-3 content of RBCs, the reduction in LVSVI was much higher at 13%.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with 4 grams of omega-3 for half a year after a heart attack significantly improved heart function, compared to a placebo.  Finding 2: Omega-3 Supplements Reduced Myocardial Fibrosis  Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of scar tissue in the heart muscle. It reduces the heart’s ability to contract and pump blood.  Increased MF is often seen following a heart attack and increases the risk of heart failure.  The researchers assessed non-infarct myocardial fibrosis (NMF), which is myocardial fibrosis in undamaged areas of the heart.  The researchers were unable to measure NMF directly. Instead, they measured extracellular volume fraction, which is a marker of MF.  On average, the participants experienced a 5.6% improvement in NMF, compared to a placebo. The chart below shows the differences between groups:   The researchers also measured ST2 , a circulating marker of MF. Levels of ST2 are elevated when the heart muscle is dysfunctional or partially dead ( 3 ).  They discovered that high-dose omega-3 supplementation reduced ST2 by 7.9%, further confirming its benefits for patients with heart disease. These findings are consistent with previous studies ( 4 ).  Both groups also experienced a significant improvement in infarct size (areas of dead heart tissue), but the difference was not statistically significant between groups.  All of these benefits were associated with an increase in the omega-3 content of red blood cells.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with omega-3 decreased heart tissue scarring (myocardial fibrosis), reducing the risk of heart failure.  Finding 3: Omega-3 Supplements Decreased Inflammation  The study found that supplementing with omega-3 reduced circulating levels of myeloperoxidase by 8.1%.  Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme that has been used as a marker of inflammation in the heart ( 5 ).  The authors speculated that the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids explain the health benefits seen in the current study.  These findings are consistent with previous studies in animals and humans ( 6 , 7 , 8 ).  Bottom Line: Omega-3 supplements also decreased inflammation, potentially explaining their benefits for heart function.  Limitations  This study didn’t have any major limitations.  However, a considerable proportion of the participants couldn’t return for a lab visit at the end of the study.  Additionally, the participants started supplementing with omega-3 two to four weeks after having a heart attack.  Changes in LVSVI and NMF were only modest compared to clinical care guidelines, but much greater benefits could have been achieved if the treatment had started earlier.  Finally, the omega-3 came from a prescription supplement with the brand name Lovaza, which was provided by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. It is unclear if regular omega-3 supplements are as effective.  Bottom Line: This study didn’t appear to have any major limitations. However, if the omega-3 treatment had started immediately after a heart attack, the participants might have achieved much greater benefits.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that supplementing with 4 grams of omega-3 for 6 months helped repair some of the damage caused by a heart attack.  Many previous studies have confirmed the health benefits of omega-3 supplements, and most health authorities promote adequate dietary intake of omega-3 oils.  The present results strongly support the use of high-dose omega-3 supplements after a heart attack.  But even if you are healthy and fit, regularly eating fatty fish or supplementing with omega-3 might reduce your risk of developing chronic disease later in life.  Tags: Heart attack , Omega-3
https://authoritynutrition.com/research/can-chili-peppers-help-you-lose-weight/
	Can Chili Peppers Help You Lose Weight?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 8, 2016  Chili peppers are well known for their pungent taste.  Not only do they cause a burning sensation in your mouth, they may also help you burn calories.  Here is a summary of a recent review on the potential weight loss benefits of chili peppers and its active ingredients â capsaicinoids.   Article Reviewed  This review discussed the effects of red chili peppers and capsaicinoids on calorie expenditure, calorie intake and appetite.  Capsaicinoids: a spicy solution to the management of obesity?  What Are Capsaicinoids?  Capsaicinoids are a class of compounds found in peppers.  The most widely studied capsaicinoid is capsaicin , which is responsible for hot peppers’ burning sensation.  Capsaicin binds with nerve endings that sense pain, known as pain receptors. Although eating chili peppers makes you feel as if they are actually burning you, they do not cause any real burning.  However, high doses of capsaicinoids, such as in pepper spray, may cause severe irritation.  Capsinoids are a related class of compounds. They include capsiate, a non-pungent compound found in bell peppers (sweet peppers).  Bottom Line: Capsaicinoids are compounds found in hot peppers. The most common capsaicinoid is capsaicin, which causes a burning sensation.  Capsaicinoids Increase Calorie Expenditure  Many studies show that supplementing with capsaicinoids or capsinoids leads to an increase in calorie expenditure after meals, or the thermic effect of food .  Below are summaries of a few studies from over the years:   1995: In men, calorie expenditure was significantly higher after a breakfast containing red chili peppers, compared to a control breakfast ( 1 ).  1998: Adding 10 grams of red pepper to a breakfast significantly increased lipid oxidation and the thermic effect of food in Japanese women, especially after a high-fat meal ( 2 ).  2000: This study showed that a yellow curry sauce containing chili peppers increased calorie expenditure after a meal in lean women. However, a similar effect was not seen in obese women ( 3 ).  2003: In overweight participants, capsaicin supplementation increased fat oxidation after weight loss, compared to the control ( 4 ).  2013: In normal-weight people, a breakfast containing chili and medium-chain triglycerides increased the thermic effect of food by 51%, compared to a breakfast containing pepper and sunflower oil ( 5 ).   These findings have been confirmed by reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials ( 6 , 7 ).  Studies also indicate that non-pungent capsinoids, which are found in sweet peppers, may stimulate calorie expenditure. However, their effect is weaker and higher doses may be needed to raise calorie expenditure to a similar extent as capsaicin ( 8 , 9 , 10 ).  How capsaicinoids work is not completely understood. Studies suggest that both capsaicin and capsinate increase calorie expenditure by stimulating the release of catecholamines from the adrenal gland ( 11 , 12 ).  Bottom Line: Supplementing with capsaicin or eating red chili peppers may increase calorie expenditure after a meal.  Capsaicin May Reduce Calorie Intake  Not only does capsaicin increase calorie expenditure after meals, it also seems to suppress appetite and increase fullness ( 13 ).  It may even counteract the rise in appetite associated with a calorie deficit ( 14 ).  Accordingly, studies show that capsaicin reduces calorie intake during a meal. One study showed that adding red peppers to an appetizer reduced calorie intake by 189 kcal (791 kJ) at a subsequent buffet meal ( 15 , 16 ).  These effects were confirmed by a meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials. On average, supplementing with capsaicinoids or red chili peppers reduced calorie intake by 74 kcal (310 kJ) at a single meal ( 17 ).  One study suggested that the appetite-reducing effects of chili peppers are brought about by digestive distress rather than the release of satiety hormones ( 18 ).  However, those who are used to eating chili peppers may become desensitized to its effects on appetite and calorie intake ( 19 ).  Bottom Line: Eating chili peppers or supplementing with capsaicin during or before a meal reduces calorie intake by suppressing appetite.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, capsaicin and other capsaicinoids from chili peppers temporarily increase the amount of calories burned after meals.  They may also reduce calorie intake during a meal by suppressing appetite and increasing fullness.  Although these effects may potentially help people lose excess weight, controlled trials are needed to confirm their weight loss benefits, the optimal dosage and long-term safety.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (July 29th – August 5th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 5, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Acetate produced by gut bacteria may play an important role in obesity and metabolic disorders.  No strong evidence suggests that interesterified fat — a popular replacement for trans fat — is unhealthy.  Supplementing with quercetin may reduce blood pressure.  Exclusive breastfeeding during the first months of life may protect against infections.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two articles: one examining the role of acetate in the development of obesity and metabolic disease and another on the available evidence regarding the health effects of interesterified fat.   Review:  Acetate Has a Potential Role in Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome.  Article:  Acetate mediates a microbiome-brain-β-cell axis to promote metabolic syndrome.  Summary: This was a series of experiments in rats examining the potential role of acetate, which is produced by gut bacteria, in the development of obesity and metabolic disease.  The studies suggest that acetate may play an important role in obesity and metabolic disorders. However, the findings need to be confirmed in human trials.   Review:  Interesterified Fat: Is it a Healthy Replacement for Trans Fats?  Article:  The Increasing Use of Interesterified Lipids in the Food Supply and Their Effects on Health Parameters.  Summary: This article reviewed the available evidence regarding the effects of interesterified fat on health. Many food producers are increasing their use of interesterified fat as a healthier replacement for trans fat.  The review concluded that interesterified fat appears to be safe. No strong evidence suggests that it causes health problems. However, further studies are needed before strong claims can be made.   New Research from Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Heart Health  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Lung Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Oxidative Stress  Inflammation  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Infections and Immune Health  Women’s Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Sleep quality and obesity in young subjects: a meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis examined the association of sleep quality with overweight or obesity in young people. It concluded that poor sleep quality may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity, irrespective of sleep duration.   2. Heart Health  Effects of Quercetin on Blood Pressure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  Quercetin is one of the most common antioxidant flavonoids found in plant foods. It is also sold as a supplement.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded supplementing with quercetin significantly reduced blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, the dosage required may be higher than 500 mg per day.   High intake of fatty fish, but not of lean fish, affects serum concentrations of TAG and HDL-cholesterol in healthy, normal-weight adults: a randomised trial.  This randomized controlled trial in healthy, lean adults examined the effects of fish on blood lipids. Specifically, it compared the effects of eating 750 grams of lean fish (cod) every week for 4 weeks or an equivalent amount of fatty fish (salmon).  The study showed that an intake of fatty fish had beneficial effects on the blood lipid profile, increasing HDL cholesterol and reducing triglycerides. In comparison, lean fish had no significant effects on blood lipids.   Drinking Water Sodium and Elevated Blood Pressure of Healthy Pregnant Women in Salinity-Affected Coastal Areas.  Drinking water in many coastal areas in Southeast Asia is contaminated by high amounts of sodium (salt).  This observational study in healthy, pregnant women in Southeast Asia showed that those who drank water contaminated with salt had significantly higher blood pressure, compared to those who drank rain water.   The effects of resveratrol intervention on risk markers of cardiovascular health in overweight and obese subjects: a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Resveratrol is an antioxidant found in plant foods, such as the skin of red grapes and blueberries.  This pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that resveratrol might help prevent or treat heart disease. Specifically, 300 mg per day or more significantly reduced cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting blood sugar levels.   Low fruit consumption and omission of daily meals as risk factors for increased blood pressure in adults.  This observational study in Brazilian adults showed that low consumption of fruits, fewer meals per day and being overweight was linked with a greater risk of high blood pressure.   Effects of Magnesium Supplementation on Blood Pressure: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplementing with 300 mg per day of magnesium for at least 1 month may lower blood pressure in adults. However, further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage.   Urbanised South Asians’ Susceptibility to Coronary Heart Disease: The High-Heat Food Preparation Hypothesis.  South Asians are at a relatively high risk of coronary heart disease. The elevated risk is not fully explained by known risk factors.  The authors of this review suggest that the popularity of high-heat cooking may be to blame. Deep-frying and re-heating of oils at high temperatures may lead to the formation of harmful compounds, such as advanced glycation end products .   3. Brain and Mental Health  Dietary flavonoid intake and risk of incident depression in midlife and older women.  Flavonoids are a large group of antioxidants found in fruit, vegetables and other plant foods.  This large observational study in women suggests that high flavonoid intake may reduce the risk of depression, especially among older women.   Breakfast consumption has no effect on neuropsychological functioning in children: a repeated-measures clinical trial.  This study in children indicates that eating breakfast has no significant effects on attention, impulsivity, cognitive processing speed, verbal learning or short-term memory, compared to those who fasted.   Plasma vitamin D status and recurrent depressive symptoms in the French SU.VI.MAX cohort.  This observational study showed that when circulating vitamin D levels were above 10 ng/mL people were less likely to experience recurrent depressive symptoms.  The authors concluded that vitamin D may have a preventive value against depression, especially among those on a poor diet.   Branched-chain amino acids, arginine, citrulline alleviate central fatigue after 3 simulated matches in taekwondo athletes: a randomized controlled trial.  This small randomized controlled trial in taekwondo athletes suggests that supplementing with branched-chain amino acids — arginine and citrulline — may help maintain cognitive reaction time after high-intensity exercise.   4. Eyes and Vision  Lutein, Zeaxanthin and Meso-zeaxanthin Supplementation Associated with Macular Pigment Optical Density.  Macular pigment density (MPD) is the amount of macular pigment found in the eye. Macular pigment plays an important role in protecting the eye against harmful blue light. In a way, it functions as a pair of natural sunglasses.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplementing with the carotenoid antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin improved MPD in healthy individuals and patients with age-related macular degeneration.   5. Lung Health  Obesity increases the prevalence and the incidence of asthma and worsens asthma severity.  This observational study found that being obese is associated with an increased risk of being asthmatic. Greater obesity was linked with increased asthma severity.   6. Muscles and Physical Performance  The effect of acute pre-workout supplementation on power and strength performance.  This study in men showed that supplementing with caffeine before exercise improved endurance, compared to a placebo.   7. Oxidative Stress  Arginine intake is associated with oxidative stress in a general population.  Arginine is an amino acid found in both animal and plant-derived protein.  This observational study showed that high intakes of protein and arginine from animal sources was associated with higher malondialdehyde levels, a marker of oxidative stress.   8. Inflammation  Nutrient patterns and chronic inflammation in a cohort of community dwelling middle-aged men.  This observational study in middle-aged men examined the association of dietary patterns and chronic inflammation.  It found that a diet mainly based on plant foods was linked with reduced levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which is an inflammatory marker. In contrast, an animal-based diet was linked with higher levels of CRP.   Associations between nut consumption and inflammatory biomarkers.  This observational study used data from the Nurses’ Health Study. It found that frequent nut consumption was linked with lower circulating levels of inflammatory markers.   9. Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Five-Year Follow-Up of High-Risk Infants with Family History of Allergy Who Were Exclusively Breast-Fed or Fed Partial Whey Hydrolysate, Soy, and Conventional Cow’s Milk Formulas: Expression of Serious Concern.  This observational study in infants showed that exclusive breast feeding or feeding with partial whey hydrolysate formula until 6 months of age is linked with a reduced risk of eczema and food allergy.   10. Infections and Immune Health  Exclusive breastfeeding duration and infant infection.  This observational study showed that exclusive breastfeeding (EB) may protect against infections in infants. Specifically, EB for less than 4 months after birth was linked to an increased risk of chest infections and diarrhea.   11. Women’s Health  Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and treatment outcomes of women undergoing assisted reproduction.  This observational study in women showed that circulating levels of vitamin D were associated with an increased fertilization rate. However, vitamin D was not linked with a better chance of pregnancy or live birth.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Interesterified Fat: Is it a Healthy Replacement for Trans Fats?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 4, 2016  Most people with a basic knowledge of nutrition have heard about trans fat.  For decades, trans fat has been added to processed food products to replace saturated fat, decrease cost and improve shelf life.  However, the consumption of trans fat has consistently been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. As a result, the FDA has determined that trans fat is not safe.  As a replacement, many food producers have started using interesterified fat . Below is a summary of a recent review on interesterified fat and its potential health effects.   Review  This article reviewed the available evidence regarding the health effects of interesterified fat.  The Increasing Use of Interesterified Lipids in the Food Supply and Their Effects on Health Parameters.  What are Interesterified Lipids?  Food producers have always sought to improve their profits.  Most of the time, this involves using chemicals to enhance the sensual qualities of foods — flavor, texture or color — and lengthen their shelf life. Unfortunately, consumer health is not necessarily high on the agenda.  The long-term health effects of many additives and modified ingredients are largely unknown.  For example, trans fat (hydrogenated oils) was once believed to be safe. Today, most scientists agree that eating high amounts of trans fat may impair heart health over time.  In 2015, the FDA gave food manufacturers 3 years to stop using trans fat completely, although they can apply for an exemption if necessary ( 1 ).  To replace trans fat, food producers are increasingly turning to interesterified fat, which has similar properties.  Interesterified fat is synthetic and has been used in the edible oils industry for decades. Understanding how it’s produced requires some understanding of fat structure.  Fat is normally in the form of triglycerides. Each triglyceride molecule is composed of a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached to it.  The types of fatty acids in a triglyceride molecule determine its physical properties, as well as its health effects.  When fat is interesterified, the configuration and composition of triglycerides on the glycerol backbone is changed.  Interesterification is a chemical reaction that basically leads to fatty acid exchange within or between triglycerides.  This results in the formation of new triglycerides with unique properties, such as a more desirable texture, mouthfeel or different melting point.  There are two different kinds of interesterification:   Chemical interesterification: This type of interesterification is random. Specifically, there is a random exchange of fatty acids within and between triglycerides.  Enzymatic interesterification: This type of interesterification is specific. Certain fatty acids are exchanged, depending on the type of enzyme used.   As opposed to trans fat production (hydrogenation), interesterification does not involve changing the structure of fatty acids.  However, interesterification may lead to unusual fatty acid configurations on the glycerol backbone.  Bottom Line: Interesterified fat is made by exchanging fatty acids within or between triglycerides. This changes the triglycerides’ physical properties.  How Does Interesterified Fat Affect Health?  The health effects of fat (triglycerides) depends on at least three factors:   The amount consumed.  The types of fatty acids it contains.  The position of the fatty acids on the glycerol backbone ( 2 ).   Interesterification is usually carried out between a liquid oil and a fat that is solid at room temperature (with a high melting point).  Liquid oil is usually interesterified with stearic acid — the second most common saturated fatty acid in the US diet ( 3 ).  Bottom Line: The health effects of interesterified fat depend on which fatty acids it contains, but the position of fatty acids on the glycerol backbone may also be relevant.  What Are the Health Effects of Interesterified Fats?  A few studies have investigated the health effects of interesterified fats. Below is a summary of their main findings.   Blood sugar control: Three studies comparing interesterified fat with normal fat found no significant differences in insulin or glucose levels ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Blood lipid profile: Studies comparing interesterified fat with normal fat found it had similar effects on the blood lipid profile ( 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Blood coagulation: One trial in 17 healthy men compared the effects of interesterified cocoa butter (ICB), with normal cocoa butter. It showed that the ICB decreased the levels of factor VII , reducing blood coagulation ( 12 ).   Taken together, the available evidence suggests that interesterified fat does not adversely affect the blood lipid profile, blood sugar control or coagulation.  Bottom Line: No evidence suggests that interesterified fat adversely affects health, but further studies are needed.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this review concluded that eating interesterified fat does not impair health when compared to non-interesterified fat with a similar fatty acid composition.  Therefore, they may be a healthy replacement for trans fats in processed food products.  However, many aspects of interesterified fat still warrant further investigation. More studies are needed to fully reveal its long-term effects.  Tags: Interesterified fat , Trans fat
https://authoritynutrition.com/research/acetate-and-obesity-and-metabolic-syndrome/
	Acetate Has a Potential Role in Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  August 2, 2016  Certain gut bacteria are more common in obese people and those with metabolic syndrome.  Although the health relevance of this is not completely understood, many scientists believe that an imbalanced gut microbiota (dysbiosis) may contribute to obesity and metabolic syndrome ( 1 ).  Growing evidence suggests that certain chemical compounds produced by gut bacteria play a role. These include short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, propionate and acetate.  Below is a detailed summary of a recent study on the potential role of acetate in the development of obesity.   Article Reviewed  This was a series of experiments in rats investigating the potential role of acetate in the development of obesity and metabolic diseases.  Acetate mediates a microbiome-brain-Î˛-cell axis to promote metabolic syndrome.  Finding 1: A High-Fat Diet Increased Acetate Levels  The researchers discovered that a high-fat diet increased circulating acetate levels and whole-body acetate turnover in rats. It also more than doubled the levels of acetate in the cecum and colon.  Colon removal, colon washout or a broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment reduced whole-body acetate turnover by 75â90%.  Additionally, the study showed that rats without any gut bacteria had negligible amounts of acetate in their digestive tracts.  Together, these findings strongly suggest that acetate-producing bacteria in the colon were responsible for the rise in acetate.  In rats that had been fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks, a 48-hour fast led to a 50% reduction in whole-body acetate turnover. In contrast, calorie excess increased acetate turnover.  Therefore, it seems that acetate production is driven by calorie-dense diets.  In a separate test-tube experiment, the researchers showed that bacteria in feces can produce acetate from glucose or fatty acids.  Bottom Line: A high-fat diet may increase intestinal and circulating acetate levels.  Finding 2: Acetate Increased Insulin Secretion  The researchers detected a significant increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rats fed a high-fat diet for 3 days or 4 weeks.  Injections of acetate into rats fed a normal diet led to similar increases in GSIS, indicating that acetate was responsible for the effects.  Interestingly, the increase in GSIS was blocked after colon removal, colon washout or a broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.  Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that elevated bacterial production of acetate in the colon is responsible for the increased GSIS.  Bottom Line: A high-fat diet or increased acetate production in the colons of rats led to increases in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.  Finding 3: Acetate Affects Insulin Levels Via the Parasympathetic Nervous System  Instead of directly affecting the pancreas, the study indicates that acetate affects insulin levels indirectly through the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).  The researchers measured a marker of PNS activity or gastrin , a digestive hormone whose levels are known to be under PNS control.  After injecting rats with acetate for one hour, circulating gastrin levels increased threefold, indicating increased PNS activity.  Additionally, acetate levels in the brain increased, confirming that acetate is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain circulation.  The brain communicates with the gut via the vagus nerve , which is part of the PNS. When the researchers severed the vagus nerve, acetate’s effects on insulin levels stopped and insulin levels reduced fourfold.  The researchers got similar results when they injected the rats with atropine , a chemical that blocks the activity of the PNS and vagus nerve.  These findings strongly suggest that acetate affects insulin levels indirectly via the brain and PNS.  Bottom Line: Acetate affects insulin levels via the brain and parasympathetic nervous system.  Finding 4: Chronically Elevated Acetate Promotes Weight Gain and Metabolic Disease  The researchers also investigated the effects of continuously injecting acetate into the stomach for 10 days. The amount of acetate used mimicked the effects of a high-fat diet.  Doing this increased the following metabolic factors:   Insulin secretion.  Insulin resistance.  Ghrelin levels : Acetate caused a threefold increase in the levels of ghrelin, the hunger hormone.  Triglycerides : Acetate increased the levels of triglycerides in the liver and muscles.  Liver gluconeogenesis : Formation of sugar increased in the liver.   Acetate also doubled the rats’ calorie intake and weight gain during the 10-day study period, an effect largely explained by the rise in ghrelin.  All of these effects were blocked when the researchers severed the vagus nerve, suggesting that acetate affects metabolism indirectly via the brain and parasympathetic nervous system.  Although acetate may increase appetite, previous studies indicate propionate (another short-chain fatty acid) reduces calorie intake and the appeal of high-calorie foods.  Bottom Line: Injecting acetate into the stomach for 10 days led to increased calorie intake and promoted weight gain and metabolic disorders.  Limitations  These studies were done in rats.  Although basic metabolism is similar in rats and humans, the findings need to be confirmed in clinical trials.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This series of experiments in rats suggests acetate, which is formed by gut bacteria in response to calorie-dense foods, may promote obesity and metabolic disease.  Although a number of lifestyle factors contribute to obesity and metabolic syndrome, this study strongly suggests that the gut microbiota may play an important role.  However, before any solid conclusions can be reached about the role of acetate in humans, clinical trials need to confirm the findings of the current study.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (July 22nd–29th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 29, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Eating prebiotic fiber leads to succinate formation in the digestive tract, improving blood sugar control.  Eating potatoes is not consistently linked to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.  Infants frequently fed during the nighttime are at an increased risk of obesity.  Eating less fructose significantly improves the blood lipid profile.  A diet low in advanced glycation end-products improves the blood lipid profile and reduces inflammation in diabetic people.  Supplementing with vitamin D may improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two articles: one about the effects of potatoes on obesity, diabetes and heart disease and another examining the role of prebiotic fiber and succinate in blood sugar control.   Review:  Do Potatoes Cause Obesity, Diabetes and Heart Disease?  Article:  Potatoes and risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in apparently healthy adults: a systematic review of clinical intervention and observational studies.  Summary: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of potatoes on weight gain, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  The study showed that potatoes are not consistently associated with an increased risk of weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes or heart disease in healthy people. However, French fries appear to be unhealthy in high amounts.   Review:  Succinate Explains Why Prebiotic Fiber Improves Blood Sugar Levels.  Article:  Microbiota-Produced Succinate Improves Glucose Homeostasis via Intestinal Gluconeogenesis.  Summary: This was a series of interventional studies in rats and mice. They examined the role of prebiotic fiber and succinate in blood sugar control.  The studies showed that when certain gut bacteria ferment prebiotic fiber, they produce succinate. Succinate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis, which improves blood sugar control.   New Research from Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Lung Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Inflammation  Infections and Immune Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Women’s Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Maternal diet quality in pregnancy and neonatal adiposity: the Healthy Start Study.  This observational study suggests that poor diet quality during pregnancy increases the risk of excessive fat mass (adiposity) in newborns.  This association was independent of the mother’s total calorie intake or body mass index before pregnancy.   Predominantly nighttime feeding and weight outcomes in infants.  This observational study in 12-month-old infants showed that frequent nighttime feeding was linked to increased fat gain and risk of overweight in early childhood.   Association of pasta consumption with body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio: results from Moli-sani and INHES studies.  This observational study showed that eating pasta as a component of the Meditarrenean diet was associated with reduced body mass index, waist circumference and a lower risk of obesity.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Meat Consumption and Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes in the SUN Project: A Highly Educated Middle-Class Population.  Previous observational studies indicate that high meat consumption may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).  This observational study supports earlier evidence. It showed that meat consumption, especially processed meat, was associated with an increased risk of developing T2D.   Effects of a Multispecies Probiotic Mixture on Glycemic Control and Inflammatory Status in Women with Gestational Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.   This randomized controlled trial in women with diabetes during pregnancy examined the health effects of supplementing with a multispecies probiotic mixture for 8 weeks.  Taking probiotics led to a significant decrease in several inflammatory markers. Additionally, insulin levels and insulin sensitivity was improved in the probiotic group, compared to the placebo.   3. Heart Health  Evaluation of daily ginger consumption for the prevention of chronic diseases in adults: a cross-section study.   This observational study suggests that consuming 2–6 grams of ginger per day was linked to a reduced risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.   Short-term isocaloric fructose restriction lowers apoC-III levels and yields less atherogenic lipoprotein profiles in children with obesity and metabolic syndrome.  This 9-day study in obese children with metabolic syndrome examined the effects of reducing fructose intake (from 12 to 4% of daily calories) on the blood lipid profile.  Eating less fructose led to a significant improvement in the blood lipid profile, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.   Fatty acid status and antioxidant defence system in mothers and their newborns after salmon intake during late pregnancy.   This randomized controlled trial examined how eating salmon affects the fatty acid content of pregnant women’s red blood cells.  From week 20 of pregnancy until delivery, the women ate 150 grams of salmon twice per week. The salmon did not significantly change the fatty acid content of their blood, compared to following a diet low in fatty fish.   4. Cancer  Coffee, tea and caffeine intake and the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer: a review of the literature and meta-analysis.  Melanoma is more serious than other types of skin cancer. Other types of skin cancer are often referred to as non-melanoma skin cancers and include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that drinking coffee may protect against BCC, but the effect is moderate. These findings need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials.   Overweight, obesity and the risk of gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct cancers: A meta-analysis of observational studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that being overweight or significantly obese increases the risk of developing cancer in the gallbladder and bile duct.   Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis.  This observational study suggests that eating a lot of marine, omega-3 fatty acids reduces the risk of death among people who have colorectal cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Influence of unhealthy food and beverage marketing on children’s dietary intake and preference: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials concluded that the marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages makes children more likely to select them when given a choice.   Changes in liking for sweet and fatty foods following weight loss in women are related to prop phenotype but not to diet.  This study in women showed that losing weight caused a shift in food preferences. Specifically, losing weight led to an increased preference for foods with a lower sucrose and fat content.  However, the nutrient composition of the weight-loss diet (low-fat vs low-carb) didn’t affect food preferences.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Probiotic supplementation can positively affect anxiety and depressive symptoms: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.   Probiotics are bacteria that provide health benefits when consumed. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that some types of probiotics may help reduce anxiety and depression. However, the evidence is limited.   7. Digestive Health  Dietary silver nanoparticles can disturb the gut microbiota in mice.  Silver nanoparticles (SNP) are increasingly being used by the food industry. SNPs have antibacterial activity and increase the shelf-life of processed food products.  This study in mice showed that SNPs didn’t cause any signs of toxicity. However, they disturbed the gut microbiota by reducing bacterial diversity. SNPs likely have similar effects in humans and potentially affect health.   Effect of vitamin D on gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related quality of life in irritable bowel syndrome patients: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) showed that supplementing with 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 every two weeks for 6 months improved quality of life.  Specifically, it reduced several IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain, flatulence, distention and rumbling.   8. Kidney and Urinary Health  Higher protein intake is associated with increased risk for incident end-stage renal disease among blacks with diabetes in the Southern Community Cohort Study.  Renal disease, also known as nephropathy, is a general term referring to impaired kidney function due to disease or injury.  This observational study in African Americans with diabetes showed that a high protein intake was linked to an increased risk of end-stage renal disease.   9. Lung Health  Obesity increases the prevalence and the incidence of asthma and worsens asthma severity.  Obesity is associated with a variety of health problems. This observational study suggests that obesity increases the risk of developing asthma.   10. Muscles and Physical Performance  A systematic review and meta-analysis of carbohydrate benefits associated with randomized controlled competition-based performance trials.  Athletes frequently consume carb supplements before exercise to improve performance.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that carb supplements may improve performance in male cyclists, especially when exercising for more than 90 minutes.   11. Inflammation  Low advanced glycation end-product diet improves the lipid and inflammatory profiles of pre-diabetic subjects.  Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a group of compounds that naturally form in your body when sugar reacts with protein. High blood sugar levels promote their formation, but AGEs are also found in some processed food products.  This 6-month randomized controlled study in pre-diabetic people showed that a diet low in AGEs led to an improved blood lipid profile and reduced inflammation.   Effect of plant-based diets on obesity-related inflammatory profiles: a systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention trials.  This systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that plant-based diets are associated with a reduction in obesity-related inflammatory markers.   12. Infections and Immune Health  Association between Consumption of Coffee and the Prevalence of Periodontitis: The 2008–2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  Periodontitis, or gum disease, is characterized by inflammation in the tissues that surround the teeth. It is caused by a strong immune reaction to the bacteria that live on teeth.  This observational study in South Korean men indicates that drinking a lot of coffee may increase the risk of periodontitis.   13. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Early exclusive breastfeeding is associated with longer telomeres in Latino preschool children.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands, which protect them from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate their shortening, possibly contributing to aging.  This observational study in children showed that exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 weeks of age was associated with a longer telomere length when the children were 4–5 years of age.   Geriatric nutritional risk index correlates with length of hospital stay and inflammatory markers in older inpatients.  This study in older patients showed that a high score on the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) was associated with a higher risk of death, a longer hospital stay and lower levels of inflammatory markers.   14. Women’s Health  A prospective study of caffeine and coffee intake and premenstrual syndrome.  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may occur one or two weeks before women have their periods. The symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, headache, emotional sensitivity and mood swings.  This observational study indicates that caffeine intake does not affect PMS.   15. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Higher concentrations of branched-chain amino acids in breast milk of obese mothers.   This observational study found that the milk of obese mothers was much higher in branched-chain amino acids, compared to the milk of lean mothers. The health relevance of this for the child is unclear.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Succinate Explains Why Prebiotic Fiber Improves Blood Sugar Levels  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 27, 2016  Eating plenty of fiber is associated with multiple health benefits.  This is largely because fiber is resistant to human digestive enzymes and passes undigested down into the colon.  In the colon, gut bacteria ferment the fibers, producing beneficial byproducts such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Another less-known byproduct is succinate.  A recent study examined the health benefits of succinate in mice fed a high-fiber diet. Below is a summary of its findings, as well as some background information.   Background  This article uses several terms that some readers may be unfamiliar with. Here are simple explanations.   Blood sugar control: Refers to the body’s ability to keep blood sugar levels stable and within healthy limits.   Intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGG): The formation of new glucose (sugar) by intestinal cells. IGG may improve blood sugar control by suppressing glucose production in the liver ( 1 ).   G6pc: A gene that is necessary for the production of new glucose in the body. Intestinal gluconeogensis cannot take place without it.   Prebiotic fiber: A type of fiber that promotes the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.   Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS): A type of prebiotic fiber found in various fruits and vegetables. FOS are also sold as a dietary supplement.   Succinate: An organic acid (dicarboxylic acid) produced by certain gut bacteria when they are exposed to prebiotic fiber.   Prevotella copri: A type of gut bacteria that produces succinate from fiber.  Article Reviewed  European researchers investigated the metabolic effects of succinate formation in the intestinal tracts of mice. This is the first study to focus on its health effects.  Microbiota-Produced Succinate Improves Glucose Homeostasis via Intestinal Gluconeogenesis.   Study Design  This series of interventional studies in mice tested the effects of a high-fiber or succinate-rich diet on blood sugar control.  To examine whether succinate leads to improved blood sugar control by initiating intestinal gluconeogensis (IGG), the researchers included two groups of mice:   Normal mice: This group included normal mice with all genes necessary for IGG.  G6pc-knockout mice: This group included intestinal-specific G6pc-knockout mice. Since they were lacking the G6pc gene, IGG did not take place.   In both groups, the mice were on a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. The experiment was further divided into two parts, depending on supplementation.   Prebiotic fiber: The diet was supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides, a soluble, prebiotic fiber.  Succinate: The diet was supplemented with succinate.   Additionally, the study had two extensions. First, a separate part of the study examined the effects of a high-succinate diet on glucose formation in rat intestines.  Second, the researchers investigated the effects of supplementing with a type of bacteria known as Prevotella copri , which produces succinate.  Bottom Line: This series of interventional studies in mice and rats investigated the effects of succinate on blood sugar control.  Finding 1: A High-Fiber Diet Changed Gut Microbiota  Many previous studies clearly show that a diet high in prebiotic fiber affects gut microbiota â the types and relative abundance of bacteria living in the colon.  Additionally, studies show that a diet high in prebiotic fiber changes the gut microbiota in mice, irrespective of whether they are G6pc-knockout or not ( 2 ).  The current study supports earlier studies, showing that eating prebiotic fiber (fructo-oligosaccharides) significantly changed the gut microbiota in mice, regardless of whether they had the G6pc gene or not.  Specifically, prebiotic fiber increased the abundance of bacteria in the Bacteroidetes group, which includes Prevotella , relative to the Firmicutes group.  The Bacteroidetes group includes species of bacteria that are the major producers of succinate in the digestive tract ( 3 , 4 ).  Bottom Line: A diet high in prebiotic fiber significantly increased the abundance of bacteria that produce succinate.  Finding 2: Succinate Levels Increased on a High-Fiber Diet  Recent studies show that the levels of succinate in mouse cecum are elevated after eating fiber, and this increase is even more significant on a high-fat diet ( 5 , 6 , 7 ).  This is consistent with the present study’s findings. The researchers detected a significant increase in cecum succinate after a high-fat, high-sugar diet enriched with prebiotic fiber (fructo-oligosaccharides). This happened in both groups of mice.  Additionally, succinate levels rose higher than those of short-chain fatty acids, such as propionate and butyrate.  However, succinate levels were unchanged in the blood circulation, suggesting that most of it is metabolized in the intestines.  Bottom Line: A diet high in prebiotic fiber significantly increased the levels of succinate in mouse cecum.  Finding 3: Succinate Improved Blood Sugar Control  The researchers discovered that when rats were fed succinate, it was converted into glucose by intestinal cells.  This process is known as intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGG). Some scientists consider IGG to be a key regulator of the body’s energy balance ( 2 , 8 ).  Contrary to what you might think, studies show that IGG actually improves blood sugar control ( 1 , 9 ).  The present results are in agreement with previous findings. The study showed that succinate reduced blood sugar and insulin levels by suppressing glucose production in the liver.  However, succinate only improved blood sugar control in the normal mice, whereas the G6pc-knockout mice experienced no benefits.  These findings are consistent with studies showing that mice lacking the G6pc gene, which is necessary for IGG, did not benefit from a diet high in prebiotic fiber (fructo-oligosaccharides) ( 2 ).  Taken together, the results suggest that prebiotic fiber and succinate improve blood sugar control through their effects on IGG.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with succinate significantly improved blood sugar control by stimulating intestinal gluconeogenesis.  Finding 4: Prevotella copri Increased Succinate Levels and Improved Blood Sugar Control  Several types of bacteria produce succinate when exposed to dietary fiber.  These include bacteria of the Prevotella group, most notably Prevotella copri , which is found in the human digestive tract ( 10 ).  The present study tested the effects of supplementing the diet of mice with a live culture of P. copri .  The researchers found that supplementing with P. copri significantly increased blood sugar control (glucose tolerance), an effect that was linked with a reduction in liver glucose production.  These findings are in agreement with a previous study showing that a high abundance of P. copri was associated with improved blood sugar control in healthy people ( 11 ).  Interestingly, P. copri benefited both the normal mice and the G6pc-knockout mice, indicating that P. copri has additional, succinate-independent benefits on blood sugar control.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with Prevotella copri , a type of succinate-producing bacteria, improved blood sugar control, irrespective of intestinal gluconeogenesis.  Limitations  Since this was a series of studies in mice and rats, the findings do not necessarily apply to humans.  Although basic metabolism is similar in rodents and humans, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the health effects of succinate in people.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this series of studies in rats and mice suggests the following:   Prebiotic fiber (fructo-oligosaccharides) increases the abundance of gut bacteria that produce succinate.  A diet high in prebiotic fiber increases succinate levels in the digestive tract.  Supplementing with succinate improves blood sugar control.  Succinate is converted to glucose by intestinal cells, a process known as intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGG).  IGG improves blood sugar control by inhibiting liver gluconeogenesis.  Mice that do not have the gene (G6pc) necessary for IGG do not benefit from supplementing with fructo-oligosaccharides or succinate.  Supplementing with Prevotella copri , a succinate-producing bacteria, improves blood-sugar control in normal and G6pc-knockout mice, suggesting that it may have succinate-independent benefits.   Succinate may have similar benefits in humans. However, randomized controlled trials in people are needed before any strong conclusions can be reached.

	Do Potatoes Cause Obesity, Diabetes and Heart Disease?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 25, 2016  Potatoes are one of the world’s most popular food crops.  They are commonly eaten as a snack or fast food, such as potato chips or French fries, which are undoubtedly unhealthy in large amounts. But are boiled or baked potatoes also unhealthy?  Recently, a team of Danish researchers conducted a meta-analysis of studies examining the association of potatoes with obesity and diabetes. Below is a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  Potatoes are a major staple in the Western diet.  They are mainly composed of starch, which makes up 9–23% of their raw weight ( 1 ).  Starch is a complex carb composed of chains of glucose molecules. It is easily digested and may cause spikes in blood sugar levels when eaten on its own.  Foods like potatoes generally rank high on the glycemic index, which is a measure of how much a particular food increases your blood sugar level ( 2 ).  As a result, some people believe that eating a lot of potatoes may increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases ( 3 , 4 ).  Article Reviewed  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining whether eating potatoes raises the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes or heart disease.  Potatoes and risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in apparently healthy adults: a systematic review of clinical intervention and observational studies .  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating whether potatoes cause obesity, type 2 diabetes or heart disease in healthy adults.  The researchers searched for all relevant articles using several major electronic databases.  The inclusion criteria included the following:   The study had to include adults aged 18 or older.  The participants had to be free of diabetes or heart disease.  Intervention studies had to use white or yellow potatoes.  Intervention studies had to compare potatoes with other sources of carbs.  Single-meal studies were excluded.   Bottom Line: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of potatoes on weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  The Selected Studies  A total 103 articles were fully assessed, but only 13 met all of the inclusion criteria. Below are summaries of the included studies, all of which were prospective observational studies.   Mozaffarian D, et al. Changes in diet and lifestyle and long-term weight gain in women and men.  New England Journal of Medicine , 2011.  This large prospective observational study in American adults showed that eating 1 serving of potatoes (all types combined) daily was linked with a slight weight gain (1.28 lbs) over a 4-year period.  The study also showed that French fries were associated with the most weight gain (3.35 lbs), whereas boiled, baked or mashed potatoes were much less fattening.   Halkjær J, et al. Dietary predictors of 5-year changes in waist circumference.  Journal of the American Dietetic Association , 2009.  Each 60 calorie-per-day increase in potato consumption was linked with a 0.1 cm increase in waist circumference in women over a 5-year period. This association was not statistically significant in men.   French SA, et al. Predictors of weight change over two years among a population of working adults: the Healthy Worker Project.  International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders , 1994.  High intakes of French fries were significantly associated with weight gain in women.   Halkjær J, et al. Food and drinking patterns as predictors of 6-year BMI-adjusted changes in waist circumference.  British Journal of Nutrition , 2004.  This study found no significant links between eating potatoes and waist circumference.   Linde JA, et al. Specific food intake, fat and fiber intake, and behavioral correlates of BMI among overweight and obese members of a managed care organization.  International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity , 2006.  This study found no significant association between total potato consumption and body mass index (BMI). However, when French fries were examined separately, they were significantly associated with a higher BMI.   Halton TL, et al. Potato and french fry consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes in women.  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2006.  Eating potatoes was linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in American women. However, this only applied to obese participants with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 30.  In contrast, French fry consumption increased the risk of type 2 diabetes irrespective of people’s BMI.   Salmerón J, et al. Dietary fiber, glycemic load, and risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in women.  The Journal of the American Medical Association , 1997.  A high intake of potatoes was linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.   Villegas R, et al. Prospective study of dietary carbohydrates, glycemic index, glycemic load, and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in middle-aged Chinese women.  Archives of Internal Medicine , 2007.  Eating a lot of potatoes was linked with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Chinese women.   Salmerón J, et al. Dietary fiber, glycemic load, and risk of NIDDM in men.  Diabetes Care , 1997.  High consumption of potatoes was not associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in American men when French fries were excluded.  However, when French fries were examined separately, they were found to be significantly linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.   Liu S, et al. A prospective study of fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.  Diabetes Care , 2004.  Potato consumption was not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.   Hodge AM, et al. Glycemic index and dietary fiber and the risk of type 2 diabetes.  Diabetes Care , 2004.  Total potato consumption was not significantly linked with the risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women.   Feskens EJM, et al. Dietary factors determining diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance.  Diabetes Care , 1995.  This prospective observational study had a 20-year follow-up. It found that higher intakes of potatoes were associated with lower 2-hour blood sugar levels.   Joshipura KJ, et al. Fruit and vegetable intake in relation to risk of ischemic stroke.  The Journal of the American Medical Association , 1999.  This study in American adults that were followed for 8–14 years found no significant links between potatoes and ischemic stroke.   Finding 1: Potatoes Were Not Consistently Associated with Obesity  Five observational studies examining the association of potatoes with weight gain or obesity were selected.  They included a total of 170,413 participants and had follow-ups ranging from 2 to 20 years.  Only two of these studies reported a positive association between potatoes and measures of overweight or obesity ( 5 , 6 ).  On the other hand, when French fries were examined separately, they were more strongly linked with obesity than boiled, baked or mashed potatoes ( 5 , 7 ).  This is probably because French fries are high in unhealthy fat and associated with fast food and unhealthy dietary habits ( 8 ).  Bottom Line: Observational studies examining the association of potatoes with body weight have provided mixed results.  Finding 2: Potatoes Were Not Consistently Linked with Diabetes  Seven of the included studies examined the association of potatoes with type 2 diabetes (T2D). They included a total of 326,675 participants.  Their results were mixed. Two studies in American women linked high total potato consumption with an increased risk of T2D ( 9 , 10 ), whereas other studies suggested that potatoes may protect against T2D ( 11 , 12 ).  However, French fries were more consistently linked with an increased risk of diabetes than boiled, baked or mashed potatoes ( 9 , 10 , 13 ).  This is likely because French fries are high in unhealthy fat. Additionally, those who eat a lot of them are generally less health-conscious.  Bottom Line: Observational studies examining the association of potatoes with the risk of type 2 diabetes have provided inconsistent results.  Finding 3: Potatoes Were Not Associated with Heart Disease  The researchers included only one study investigating the association of potatoes with heart disease.  This prospective observational study consisted of two large cohorts, including a total of 114,276 participants who were followed for 8–14 years ( 14 ).  Eating potatoes was not significantly linked with an increased risk of ischemic stroke.  Bottom Line: Potatoes were not significantly linked with an increased risk of heart disease.  Limitations  Although this meta-analysis didn’t have any apparent faults, the conclusions were based on weak evidence.  No long-term randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, and all of the included studies were observational.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that potatoes are not consistently linked with an increased risk of weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes or heart disease in apparently healthy people.  However, most studies suggest that eating a lot of French fries may increase the risk of chronic disease.  Since all of the studies had an observational design, the true association of potatoes with obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease remains unclear.  Well-designed, long-term randomized controlled trials are needed before any solid conclusions can be reached.  Tags: Diabetes , Heart disease , Obesity , Potatoes

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (July 15th–22nd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 22, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Eating irregularly may adversely affect your health.  7-day antibiotic treatment has no major effects on metabolism.  Eating salmon twice a week improves your blood lipid profile.  Breastfeeding may protect against childhood cancer.  High intakes of tomato products may possibly reduce the severity of prostate cancer.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two articles: one about the effects of irregular eating habits on metabolism and another examining the effects of short-term antibiotic treatment on metabolic factors.   Review:  Irregular Eating Habits Adversely Affect Metabolism.  Article:  Irregular meal-pattern effects on energy expenditure, metabolism, and appetite regulation: a randomized controlled trial in healthy normal-weight women.  Summary: This was a randomized crossover trial comparing the effects of regular and irregular eating habits on calorie expenditure, blood sugar control, hormones and self-reported appetite.  The study showed that eating irregularly may increase hunger, impair blood sugar control and reduce calorie expenditure after meals.   Review:  Short-Term Antibiotic Treatment Has No Major Effects on Metabolism.  Article:  Effects of Gut Microbiota Manipulation by Antibiotics on Host Metabolism in Obese Humans: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of short-term antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin or vancomycin on metabolic factors in obese, pre-diabetic men.  The study found that vancomycin caused considerable changes in gut microbiota, whereas amoxicillin had no significant effects. However, vancomycin had no major effects on metabolism.   New Research from Around the World  Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Kidney and Urinary Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  No evidence for metabolic adaptation in thermic effect of food by dietary protein.  Eating is associated with a temporary increase in calorie expenditure, which is known as the thermic effect of food (TEF). Protein causes a higher TEF, compared to carbs or fat.  This study showed that the effects of protein on TEF did not change following a low (5%), normal (15%) or high-protein (25%) diet for 56 days.   Bottle Size and Weight Gain in Formula-Fed Infants.  This observational study in formula-fed infants suggests that a large bottle size may increase their risk of gaining excessive weight, compared to a smaller bottle size.   Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and BMI change among US adolescents.  Previous observational studies suggest that following the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) reduces the risk of weight gain and promotes weight loss.  This observational study supports previous findings. It showed that adhering to the MDP was associated with lower weight gain.   Associations between liking for fat, sweet or salt and obesity risk in French adults: a prospective cohort study.  This prospective observational study found that a high liking for fat is linked to a greater risk of obesity, whereas a high liking for sweet taste was linked to a decreased risk. In contrast, salt liking was not significantly linked to obesity.   Protein intake during pregnancy and offspring body composition at 6 years: the Generation R Study.  This observational study suggests that higher protein intakes during pregnancy are linked to greater lean mass in the children when they are 6 years old.  In contrast, protein intakes during pregnancy were not significantly associated with fat mass in the child.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Polyphenol- and fibre-rich dried fruits with green tea attenuate starch-derived postprandial blood glucose and insulin: a randomised, controlled, single-blind, cross-over intervention.  High amounts of fiber or polyphenol antioxidants generally improve blood sugar control after a meal. They partly work by inhibiting digestive enzymes and slowing the absorption of sugar/carbs.  This randomized controlled trial supports previous studies showing that adding fiber and polyphenols to starch significantly lowered post-meal rises in blood sugar and insulin.   Consumption of soy foods and isoflavones and risk of type 2 diabetes: a pooled analysis of three US cohorts.  Isoflavonoids, or isoflavones, are plant compounds found in legumes, especially soybeans.  This observational study found that dietary intake of isoflavones was linked to a slightly lower risk of type 2 diabetes in US men and women who generally ate low or moderate amounts of soy foods.   3. Heart Health  Association between dietary fibre intake and fruit, vegetable or whole-grain consumption and the risk of CVD: results from the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial.  This observational study indicates that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of heart disease.  Conversely, fiber and fruit consumption alone were not significantly linked to heart disease risk in fully-adjusted statistical models.   Whole-grain consumption and the risk of all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  This large meta-analysis of observational studies including a total of 816,599 people showed that high intakes of whole grains were associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease and cancer.  Additionally, for each 3-serving increase in whole grains per day, there was a 19% decrease in death from all causes.   Twice weekly intake of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) positively influences lipoprotein concentration and particle size in overweight men and women.  This randomized crossover trial showed that eating farmed salmon (90–270 grams) twice weekly for 4 weeks improved the blood lipid profile, reducing triglyceride levels and increasing HDL cholesterol levels.  Additionally, the levels of large LDL cholesterol particles increased dose dependently. Previous studies have linked similar changes with a reduced risk of heart disease.   Breast Milk Consumption in Preterm Neonates and Cardiac Shape in Adulthood.  Preterm birth is associated with changes in heart shape and function that may have adverse effects on heart health.  This observational study in preterm infants suggests that exclusive breastfeeding may improve their heart function.   Multivitamin use and the risk of hypertension in a prospective cohort study of women.  This observational study in middle-aged and older women indicates that taking multivitamins does not affect their risk of developing hypertension.   Association of alcohol consumption with coronary artery disease severity.  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is when the blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen become clogged, increasing the risk of heart attacks.  This observational study in people with suspected CAD showed that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol is associated with a lower risk of CAD, compared to heavy drinking.   4. Cancer  The Impact of Underweight Status on the Prognosis of Ovarian Cancer Patients: A Meta-Analysis.  Being underweight or nutrient deficient is associated with worse outcomes for those who have cancer, but not all studies agree.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that being underweight doesn’t negatively affect the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. However, the evidence is weak overall.   Breastfeeding, Other Early Life Exposures and Childhood Leukemia and Lymphoma.  This observational study indicates that breastfeeding may protect against cancer. Specifically, children who were breastfed at one point were 64% less likely to develop leukemia or lymphoma.  Additionally, there was a dose-response effect. Children who were breastfed for longer periods were at a reduced risk of leukemia and lymphoma, compared to those who were breastfed for a shorter period.   Tomato-based randomized controlled trial in prostate cancer patients: effect on PSA.  Prostate cancer is associated with elevated circulating levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This 3-week trial examined the effects of eating tomato products containing 30 mg of lycopene per day on PSA levels.  The study suggests that eating tomato products decreases PSA levels in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. However, the effect may depend on cancer severity, as well as blood levels of lycopene, selenium and omega-3.   5. Kidney and Urinary Health  Dietary Advanced Glycation End Products and Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease.  Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a group of compounds that naturally form in your body when sugar reacts with protein. High blood sugar levels promote their formation, but AGEs are also found in some high-fat foods.  This observational study found that a higher dietary intake of carboxymethyl lysine — a major dietary AGE found in fat — was linked to a greater risk of chronic kidney disease.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Short-Term Antibiotic Treatment Has No Major Effects on Metabolism  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 20, 2016  Some scientists believe that an imbalance in the gut microbiota — the bacteria that live in the gut — may contribute to obesity and metabolic disease.  However, human evidence is limited and mostly based on observational studies.  A recent randomized controlled trial examined the effects of an antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiota and metabolism in obese adults.  Below is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Growing evidence suggests that the bacteria living in your gut may affect your health in a number of ways. They may even play a role in chronic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 1 ).  Several factors determine what types of bacteria thrive in your gut. These include:   Dietary composition: Gut bacteria depend on what and how much you eat. For example, by eating a lot of fiber you help sustain the good bacteria that live in your gut.  Antibiotics: Using antibiotics may drastically change your gut microbiota. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the worst. Observational studies have linked antibiotic use with weight gain , especially early in life ( 2 , 3 ).   When potentially harmful bacteria overpopulate the gut and beneficial bacteria are lacking, it is often referred to as dysbiosis .  Observational studies and animal experiments have associated dysbiosis with a variety of metabolic disorders , inflammation and obesity. However, evidence from human studies is limited.  Likewise, strong evidence regarding the effects of antibiotics on metabolism in humans is lacking.  Article Reviewed  This study examined the effects of a 7-day antibiotic treatment on metabolism in overweight and obese men.  Effects of Gut Microbiota Manipulation by Antibiotics on Host Metabolism in Obese Humans: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.   Study Design  This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of antibiotics on gut microbiota and metabolism in obese people.  The researchers recruited 57 overweight and obese, pre-diabetic men who were randomly assigned to receive one of two 7-day antibiotic treatments or a placebo:   Amoxicillin: 1,500 mg/day of amoxicillin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic.  Vancomycin: 1,500 mg/day of vancomycin, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that acts against gram-positive bacteria.  Placebo: 1,500 mg/day of microcrystalline cellulose (a complex carb) without any antibacterial activity.   At the start and end of each 7-day treatment, the researchers measured the following:   Gut bacteria composition: The composition and diversity of gut microbiota was assessed by analyzing genetic material in fecal samples.  Insulin sensitivity: Whole-body insulin sensitivity, as well as insulin sensitivity in liver and fat tissue, was analyzed using a number of different methods.  Inflammatory markers: Inflammation was assessed by measuring the circulating levels of inflammatory markers — interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).  Gut permeability: Several methods were used to assess gut permeability.  Size of fat cells: Abdominal skin fat biopsies were taken to measure the size of fat cells.  Calorie expenditure: Calorie expenditure and macronutrient oxidation was measured using indirect calorimetry.  Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs): Levels of SCFAs were measured in blood and fecal samples.  Secondary bile acids (SBAs): SBAs were analyzed in blood and fecal samples.   Most of the measurements were conducted after a 10-hour, overnight fast.  To find out if the any of the effects were sustained in the long-term, the researchers measured calorie expenditure, fat cell size and insulin sensitivity two months after the antibiotic treatment ended.  Bottom Line: This was a 7-day randomized controlled trial examining the effects of two antibiotics — amoxicillin and vancomycin — on various metabolic factors in obese, prediabetic men.  Finding 1: Vancomycin Decreased Bacterial Diversity  The study showed that using vancomycin significantly decreased bacterial diversity, compared to a placebo. In contrast, amoxicillin had no significant effects.  Vancomycin had the strongest effects on bacteria in the Firmicutes group, which is involved in short-chain fatty acid formation and the metabolism of bile acids.  Other groups of bacteria increased in abundance, including the vancomycin-resistant Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterococcus .  Similar changes have been observed in previous studies examining the effects of antibiotics on gut microbiota ( 4 , 5 ).  The present study showed that many of these changes in the gut microbiota were sustained for at least 2 months after the antibiotic treatment ended.  Bottom Line: Vancomycin significantly decreased bacterial diversity, while amoxicillin had no significant effects.  Finding 2: Antibiotics Didn’t Affect Insulin Sensitivity  Insulin sensitivity is a measure of the sensitivity of cells to insulin.  In healthy people, insulin tells the body to clear sugar from the blood. In people with poor blood sugar control, such as diabetics, the body’s cells do not respond efficiently to insulin and blood sugar levels tend to remain high after a meal.  This phenomenon is known as insulin resistance or low insulin sensitivity.  This study showed that a 7-day antibiotic treatment did not affect insulin sensitivity.  These results are supported by a previous study in lean men showing that a broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment did not affect blood sugar control ( 6 ).  However, the findings contrast one study in obese people showing that vancomycin reduced insulin sensitivity by 4% in some of the participants. However, the decrease was modest, and the study didn’t include a control group ( 4 ).  Bottom Line: An antibiotic treatment with vancomycin or amoxicillin did not affect insulin sensitivity.  Finding 3: Antibiotics Didn’t Affect Calorie Expenditure or Body Weight  The antibiotic treatment did not affect calorie expenditure, fat oxidation or carb oxidation after a mixed, high-fat meal.  Additionally, body weight and fat cell size remained unchanged during the antibiotic treatment and for the duration of the 2-month follow-up period.  In contrast, previous animal studies show that gut microbiota may play a role in calorie absorption and body weight ( 7 , 8 ).  The antibiotic dose might need to be higher or the treatment length longer to significantly affect body weight or calorie expenditure.  Two studies in endocarditis patients suggested that a 4–6 week treatment using a combination of different antibiotics and higher doses increased body weight ( 9 , 10 ).  However, the current study strongly suggests that a short-term, 7-day antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin or vancomycin has no such effects.  Bottom Line: A 7-day antibiotic treatment did not affect calorie expenditure or body weight.  Finding 4: Antibiotics Didn’t Cause Inflammation  The researchers measured three inflammatory markers — interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).  The circulating levels of these markers were unchanged during the antibiotic treatment.  Yet, there was a significant increase in the number of bacteria ( Proteobacteria ) that may potentially increase inflammation.  Bottom Line: A short-term antibiotic treatment did not affect the circulating levels of the inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α.  Finding 5: Antibiotics Didn’t Affect Gut Permeability  Intestinal permeability is a function of the gut wall, allowing nutrients to pass across the gut barrier and into the blood circulation.  When the gut wall is inflamed or weakened, intestinal permeability may be greater than usual. This may allow potentially harmful compounds to “leak” into the blood and cause systemic inflammation.  In fact, intestinal permeability is often assessed by measuring the circulating levels of endotoxins , which originate in the membranes of gram-negative gut bacteria ( 11 ).  This study showed that a 7-day antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin or vancomycin did not affect circulating endotoxin levels, suggesting that it doesn’t affect intestinal permeability.  Bottom Line: A 7-day antibiotic treatment didn’t increase circulating endotoxin levels, indicating that gut permeability remained unaffected.  Finding 6: Vancomycin Reduced Secondary Bile Acids  The liver plays an important role in digestion.  Not only does it store and process nutrients after they have been absorbed, it also produces bile – a liquid that’s essential in the digestion of fat.  Bile works by breaking fat into tiny droplets, known as micelles, allowing it to be absorbed into the bloodstream.  The bile is mainly composed of water and bile acids (bile salts). Most of the bile acids that enter the digestive tract are recycled, meaning they are absorbed and transported back to the liver and used to produce more bile.  A fraction of the bile acids pass down to the colon where they are changed (dehydroxylated by bacterial enzymes) into secondary bile acids (SBAs). SBAs are either absorbed or excreted in the feces.  High levels of SBAs are associated with high fat intake and have been implicated in the development of colon cancer ( 12 , 13 ).  The present study showed that vancomycin treatment reduced the levels of SBAs in feces and blood. This was accompanied by reductions in several groups of bacteria that are responsible for producing SBAs.  The health relevance of these findings is unclear.  Bottom Line: Vancomycin treatment reduced the levels of secondary bile acids, which have been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer.  Finding 7: Vancomycin Reduced the Formation of Short-Chain Fatty Acids  Certain types of beneficial gut bacteria in the Firmicutes group produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as propionate, butyrate and acetate.  SCFAs are believed to have many health benefits. They nourish the cells lining the colon, may reduce appetite and food intake and have been associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer ( 14 ).  Vancomycin led to a decrease in these SCFA-producing bacteria. Accordingly, levels of butyrate and acetate were significantly lower in the fecal samples of those who were treated with vancomycin, while amoxicillin had no effects.  Similarly, circulating levels of butyrate tended to decrease in response to a vancomycin treatment.  Bottom Line: Treatment with vancomycin, but not amoxicillin, significantly reduced the formation of short-chain fatty acids – butyrate and acetate – in the colon.  Limitations  Although the study’s design appears to be excellent, the findings cannot be generalized to all antibiotics or treatments.  Only two types of antibiotics were tested. Other types of antibiotics or higher doses might have different effects.  Additionally, a longer antibiotic treatment could have given different results, and the findings do not necessarily apply to women or lean, healthy men.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that a 7-day antibiotic treatment with vancomycin caused significant changes in gut microbiota, while amoxicillin had no significant effects.  Vancomycin also significantly reduced levels of short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids in the colon, but the health relevance of these changes is unclear.  The antibiotics didn’t affect markers of inflammation, insulin sensitivity, gut permeability or other metabolic factors.  Simply put, short-term antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin or vancomycin doesn’t seem to affect any major risk factors for obesity, heart disease or type 2 diabetes.  However, before we can make strong conclusions about the health effects of antibiotics, longer studies testing different doses and types of antibiotics are needed.

	Irregular Eating Habits Adversely Affect Metabolism  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 18, 2016  In many ways, the human body is like a well-oiled machine. It should run smoothly and with regularity.  However, some unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as poor sleep and irregular eating patterns, may disrupt its natural rhythms.  A recent study compared the effects of regular and irregular eating habits on metabolism — blood sugar control, calorie expenditure and appetite. Below is a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  In developed societies, food is always available, and acquiring it doesn’t require hard work or preparation. As a result, most people can chose when they eat and how much.  When food is easy to acquire, people who have difficulty controlling their food intake tend to overeat and gain weight. They also snack more often and eat irregularly.  For this reason, some observational studies have associated irregular eating patterns with an increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  However, growing evidence from controlled studies suggests that irregular eating patterns may affect metabolism irrespective of calorie content. For example, eating irregularly may:   Reduce the thermic effect of food ( 4 , 5 ).  Lower fasting insulin sensitivity ( 6 ).  Increase insulin levels after a test meal ( 4 , 6 ).  Raise levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol ( 4 , 6 ).  Decrease self-reported calorie intake ( 4 ).   These adverse effects of meal irregularity may have something to do with the body’s time keeping system.  Research indicates that irregular eating habits disrupt the body’s clock , which normally helps your body anticipate and prepare for food intake.  Irregular breakfast habits may be one sign of an overall irregular meal pattern.  Most controlled studies suggest that skipping breakfast or eating most of your daily calories late in the day , may promote weight gain and metabolic disease, although not all studies agree ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Article Reviewed  This study examined the effects of irregular meal patterns on carb metabolism, the thermic effect of food, blood lipids, gut hormones and appetite.  Irregular meal-pattern effects on energy expenditure, metabolism, and appetite regulation: a randomized controlled trial in healthy normal-weight women.  Study Design  This randomized crossover trial examined how eating irregularly affects metabolism, compared to eating regularly.  The researchers recruited 11 lean and healthy 18–40 year old women.  They were assigned to two 14-day treatment periods in a random order:   Regular meal pattern: For 2 weeks the participants followed a regular meal pattern consisting of 6 meals per day.  Irregular meal pattern: For 2 weeks the participants followed an irregular meal pattern consisting of 3–9 meals per day.   The study had a crossover design, which means that all participants were assigned to both treatments in a random order, separated by a 14-day washout period.  During both treatment periods, the participants were asked to consume meals at specific times of the day between 8 AM and 9 PM to ensure either the regularity or irregularity of the meal pattern.  They also followed a standardized weight-maintenance diet, providing roughly 50% of total calories from carbs, 35% from fat and 15% from protein.  Before and after each treatment period, the researchers measured calorie expenditure and took blood samples.  All blood samples were taken in the morning after a 12-hour overnight fast and again several times following a test drink.  Circulating levels of blood sugar, blood lipids, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY) and ghrelin were measured in blood samples, and insulin sensitivity was calculated.  Blood sugar was also continuously monitored for 3 successive days during each treatment period.  Additionally, the participants were asked to rate their appetite on a visual analog scale (VAS) before and after a pasta-based test meal on days 7 and 14 of each treatment period.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized crossover trial comparing the effects of regular and irregular eating habits on calorie expenditure, blood sugar control, hormones and self-reported appetite.  Finding 1: Eating Irregularly Decreased the Thermic Effect of Food  After you eat there’s a temporary increase in the amount of calories you burn. This rise in calorie expenditure is known as the thermic effect of food (TEF) or diet-induced thermogenesis.  The study showed that TEF increased significantly during the regular meal pattern intervention.  Specifically, the rise in TEF was considerably higher following a regular meal pattern, compared to the irregular meal pattern, as seen below.   These findings are supported by previous studies showing that meal irregularity leads to decreases in the TEF ( 4 , 5 ).  In contrast, there were no differences in average, free-living calorie expenditure or resting calorie expenditure.  Bottom Line: Eating irregularly reduced the thermic effect of food, an effect that might promote weight gain in the long-term.  Finding 2: Eating Irregularly Increased Hunger  Mean hunger ratings after the test drink decreased by 195% during the regular meal pattern intervention but only by 104% following the irregular meal pattern.  Hunger ratings were also significantly higher before and after the test meal on day 14 (the final day) of the irregular meal intervention, compared to the regular meal intervention. These findings are shown in the chart below.   Despite these increases in hunger, calorie intake during the test meal remained unchanged.  Since the participants were on a weight-maintenance diet and the study period was short, the researchers observed no significant changes in body weight.  Bottom Line: Eating irregularly increased subjective ratings of hunger. However, these changes in appetite did not significantly increase calorie intake at a test meal.  Finding 3: Eating Irregularly Reduced Levels of PYY After a Meal  Peptide YY (PYY) is a hormone that reduces appetite. Its levels increase after you eat and decrease during fasting.  This study showed that the mean levels of PYY decreased after both treatments. However, this decrease was greater after eating irregularly for 2 weeks.  Specifically, eating irregularly decreased the levels of PYY by 23%, whereas eating regularly decreased its levels by 9%.  Given that PYY may reduce appetite, the irregular eating pattern should have increased appetite or hunger. This is consistent with the results for self-reported appetite.  Bottom Line: Eating irregularly decreased mean levels of PYY, which is an appetite reducing hormone.  Finding 4: Irregular Meals Impaired Blood Sugar Control  This study showed that blood sugar levels were higher after breakfast on days 7 and 9 of the irregular eating intervention than during the regular eating intervention.  Additionally, blood sugar levels were significantly higher after the test drink on day 14 of the irregular meal pattern, compared to the regular meal pattern, as seen in the chart below.   No other significant differences in blood sugar levels or insulin were detected.  These findings are consistent with other studies showing that irregular eating habits may impair blood sugar control ( 6 ).  Bottom Line: Eating irregularly for 2 weeks slightly reduced blood sugar control.  Limitations  This well-designed study didn’t seem to have many faults.  However, the study was relatively short. Further studies are needed to examine the long-term effects of irregular eating patterns.  Additionally, the study only recruited lean women. The findings don’t necessarily apply to men or obese individuals.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that eating irregularly may increase hunger, impair blood sugar control and reduce calorie expenditure after meals.  Taken together, these changes suggest that irregular eating may lead to weight gain and metabolic imbalances over time. However, the study was too short to detect any significant changes in body weight.  Simply put, eating regularly at specific times of the day (without overeating) and avoiding snacking between meals is probably good for your health and waistline.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (July 8th–15th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 15, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition. Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Ketogenic diets don’t cause weight loss irrespective of protein and calorie intake.  Fructose may be a major cause of metabolic disorders.  Weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of excessive weight gain in the child.  Supplementing with vitamin D has no effect on knee osteoarthritis.  The human digestive system hosts a variety of viruses that may affect health.  Supplementing with omega-3 increases the health benefits of exercise in people with metabolic syndrome.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two articles: one examining the effects of a high-fat ketogenic diet on metabolism and another about the metabolic effects of eating high amounts of fructose.   Review:  Do Ketogenic Diets Have a “Metabolic Advantage?”  Article:  Energy expenditure and body composition changes after an isocaloric ketogenic diet in overweight and obese men.  Summary: This 2-month metabolic study compared the effects of a high-fat ketogenic diet with a high-carb diet while keeping protein and calorie intake constant.  The ketogenic diet caused a slight, temporary increase in calorie expenditure, which was not considered clinically relevant. However, it significantly improved blood sugar control, causing a 47% drop in insulin levels.   Review:  Fructose May be a Major Cause of Metabolic Disorders.  Article:  The Sweet Path to Metabolic Demise: Fructose and Lipid Synthesis.  Summary: This was a review on the effects of a high-fructose diet on risk factors for metabolic disorders, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  The review concluded that high fructose intake may increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and other chronic lifestyle diseases.   New Research from Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Lung Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Women’s Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Weight gain in pregnancy and child weight status from birth to adulthood in the United States.   Previous observational studies show that when mothers gain a lot weight during pregnancy their child is at a higher risk of becoming obese.  This observational study supports earlier studies indicating that excessive fat gain during pregnancy may promote weight gain and obesity in early, middle and late childhood.   Greater early and mid-pregnancy gestational weight gains are associated with excess adiposity in midchildhood.   This observational study suggests that high maternal weight gain during early and mid-pregnancy may increase the risk of excessive weight gain in mid-childhood.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and oleate enhances exercise training effects in patients with metabolic syndrome.  This was a randomized controlled trial in people with metabolic syndrome on a 24-week, high-intensity exercise program.  The study showed that drinking skim milk enriched with 275 mg of omega-3 fat and 7.5 grams of oleate improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation (CRP levels) and increased HDL-cholesterol levels, compared to a placebo.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Curcumin and insulin resistance—Molecular targets and clinical evidences.   Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Supplementing with curcumin may have various health benefits. However, research on the effects of curcumin on insulin resistance has provided inconclusive results.  Different doses, treatment times and types of curcumin supplements may affect study results. This review discussed the available evidence and how to improve the potential benefits of curcumin on blood sugar control.   4. Heart Health  Cardiovascular responses to sugary drinks in humans: galactose presents milder cardiac effects than glucose or fructose.   Three simple sugars (monosaccharides) are found in your diet: glucose (Glu), fructose (Fru) and galactose (Gal). This randomized, crossover trial compared the effects of these sugars (60 grams of each) on heart function.  The study showed that Glu and Gal caused smaller increases in blood pressure than Fru. Additionally, the increase in heart output and peripheral resistance (an aspect of blood pressure) seen after Glu ingestion was significantly lower after eating Gal.   Egg consumption and cardiovascular disease according to diabetic status: the PREDIMED study.  This was a prospective observational study in individuals at a high risk of developing heart disease. It showed that low to moderate consumption of eggs was not linked to an increased risk of heart disease.  However, eating more than 4 eggs per week was associated with a slightly increased risk (hazard ratio: 0.96) among non-diabetic individuals, when compared with the lowest consumption (less than 2 eggs per week).   Intestinal Microbiota-Generated Metabolite Trimethylamine-N-Oxide and 5-Year Mortality Risk in Stable Coronary Artery Disease: The Contributory Role of Intestinal Microbiota in a COURAGE-Like Patient Cohort.  Previous studies suggest that high circulating levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) increase the risk of heart disease. In some people, TMAO levels increase after the consumption of foods that are rich in choline.  This observational study showed that elevated TMAO levels were associated with a higher risk of death among patients with heart disease (stable coronary artery disease).   5. Cancer  Prediagnostic selenium status and hepatobiliary cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort.  Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer.  This observational study suggests that poor selenium status may increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, selenium levels were not linked with the risk of cancer in the bile duct.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Effects of maternal vitamin B12 supplementation on early infant neurocognitive outcomes: a randomized controlled clinical trial.  Vitamin B12 plays an essential role in neuronal and brain development. This controlled trial examined the effects of supplementing with 50 µg of vitamin B12 daily during pregnancy on neurocognitive outcomes in the child.  Supplementing with vitamin B12 had no significant effects on mental or cognitive function in the child at 9 months of age.   7. Digestive Health  Effectiveness of nutritional treatment and synbiotic use on gastrointestinal symptoms reduction in HIV-infected patients: randomized clinical trial.   Synbiotics are supplements containing both probiotics and prebiotics (beneficial bacteria and the fiber that nourishes them). This controlled trial examined the effects of supplementing with synbiotics on digestive problems in HIV patients.  Digestive problems are a common complaint among people with HIV and AIDS. The study showed that probiotics plus 6 grams of fructooligosaccharides had no significant effects on digestive symptoms, compared to a placebo (maltodextrin).   Gut Virome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.   Not only is the human digestive system home to billions of bacteria, it also hosts a wide variety of viruses, which are collectively known as the gut virome.  Similarly to gut bacteria, gut viruses may be implicated in chronic diseases and immune disorders. This review discusses the potential role of the gut virome in chronic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease.   8. Lung Health  Fish Oil Supplementation Enhances Pulmonary Strength and Endurance in Women Undergoing Chemotherapy.   This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of supplementing with fish oil on lung function (respiratory performance) in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.  The study showed that fish oil improved respiratory muscle strength and endurance, compared to a placebo. Supplementing also maintained normal circulating levels of triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and lactate.   9. Bone Health  Optimal Dose of Calcium for Treatment of Nutritional Rickets: A Randomized Controlled Trial.   Rickets is a bone disorder caused by a dietary deficiency in calcium, vitamin D or phosphate. Individuals with rickets have weak bones, reduced growth and sometimes bone deformities.  This study in Nigerian children with rickets showed that supplementing with 1000 or 2000 mg of calcium daily for 24 weeks was more effective at treating rickets than 500 mg of calcium.   10. Muscles and Physical Performance  Creatine Supplementation and Upper Limb Strength Performance: A Systematic Review and MetaAnalysis.   Creatine is the most popular supplement used to enhance muscle growth and strength.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplementing with creatine effectively improves strength performance in the upper body limbs.   11. Arthritis  The effect of vitamin D supplementation on knee osteoarthritis, the VIDEO study: a randomised controlled trial.   Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints. Previous observational studies show that low levels of vitamin D are associated with knee osteoarthritis.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with 800 IU of vitamin D3 daily for 3 years did not slow the progression of osteoarthritis. It also did not reduce pain, stiffness or functional loss, compared to a placebo.   12. Women’s Health  Plant-Based Therapies and Menopausal Symptoms.   Supplementing with phytoestrogens , which resemble the female sex hormone estrogen, is popular among women trying to manage their menopausal symptoms. They are mainly found in soy products and nuts.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that supplementing with phytoestrogens modestly reduces the frequency of hot flashes and vaginal dryness, whereas they have no effects on night sweats.

	Fructose May be a Major Cause of Metabolic Disorders  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 13, 2016  Excessive intake of added sugar is associated with various chronic diseases.  Added sugar is usually made of up of two simple sugars, glucose and fructose. Growing evidence suggests that fructose is the worse of the two.  Some scientists are even convinced that excessive fructose is largely responsible for several chronic, lifestyle diseases, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  Recently, a scientific review on the health effects of fructose was published in Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism . Below is a summary of the review’s main points.   Article  Researchers from Harvard Medical School and Yale University School of Medicine reviewed the scientific literature on the effects of fructose on liver fat synthesis, blood lipids, visceral fat and insulin sensitivity.  The Sweet Path to Metabolic Demise: Fructose and Lipid Synthesis.  What is Fructose?  Fructose is a common type of sugar.  It is found in small amounts in various plant foods, but the largest dietary source is added sugar in processed foods. For example, fructose makes up 50% of white sugar (sucrose) and around 55% of high-fructose corn syrup.  In the US, fructose accounts for roughly 10% of people’s total calorie intake, or 50-60 grams per day, on average. Most of it comes from sugar-sweetened beverages ( 1 ).  Bottom Line: Fructose is a type of sugar. It usually makes up roughly 50% of added sugar (in the form of sucrose) or high-fructose corn syrup.  Does Fructose Lead to Metabolic Disorders?  Eating small amounts of fructose, such as in fruits and vegetables, is not a health concern.  In contrast, excessive intake of fructose from sugar-sweetened foods and beverages has been associated with various health problems.  Observational studies suggest that eating too much fructose may lead to increased visceral obesity, high levels of triglycerides and insulin resistance ( 2 , 3 ).  Intervention studies have confirmed most of these observational findings. They have shown that consuming excessive fructose causes:   Increased lipogenesis (fat formation) in the liver ( 4 , 5 ).  Increased visceral fat ( 4 ).  Worsened blood lipid profile ( 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Decreased insulin sensitivity in the liver ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 10 ).   Bottom Line: High intake of fructose leads to various metabolic disturbances or imbalances. For example, it may worsen the blood lipid profile and disrupt blood sugar control.  Lipogenesis  When you eat more calories than your body needs the excess calories are stored as fat.  All dietary sources of calories can be stored as fat, including sugar. The process of converting sugar into fat is known as lipogenesis , and takes place in your liver.  Not all sugar is the same when it comes to lipogenesis. Fructose seems to cause much more lipogenesis, compared to an equal amount of glucose ( 4 ).  One study showed that when healthy men followed a high-fructose diet (25% of calories as fructose) for 9 days lipogenesis increased by roughly 60%, compared to a diet consisting of complex carbs ( 5 ).  Additionally, animal experiments indicate that lipogenesis increases even further when high amounts of fructose are consumed for long periods ( 11 , 12 ).  Studies in mice have shown that high fructose consumption increases the activity of a protein known as SREBP1c, also called “the master regulator of lipid synthesis.” This protein promotes the conversion of fructose into fat ( 13 , 14 ).  Bottom Line: High fructose intake increases lipogenesis (the formation of fat) in the liver.  Visceral Fat  Visceral fat accumulates in the abdominal cavity, filling up the space around the intestines and the liver, causing the belly to expand. It is also known as intra-abdominal fat mass.  Men are predisposed to accumulating visceral fat, whereas it is less of a problem in women. In fact, many men tend to primarily gain fat in the belly area.  Visceral fat, as opposed to skin fat, is associated with adverse health effects and metabolic disease.  A few human intervention studies have examined the effects of a high-fructose diet on visceral fat.  One 10-week study fed overweight and obese individuals fructose or glucose amounting to 25% of their daily calorie intake ( 4 ).  Weight gain was similar in both groups. However, those who got fructose gained significantly more visceral body fat, as shown in the chart below.   Bottom Line: Excessive consumption of fructose may promote accumulation of visceral fat, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  Blood Lipids  Not only does excessive sugar intake increase your blood sugar levels, it may also increase the amounts of fat circulating in your blood.  This is because excess sugar is converted to fatty acids by the liver. The process is known as lipogenesis (described above).  Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in your body, making up body fat and most of the fat that circulates in your bloodstream. They are made up of three fatty acids connected to a glycerol backbone.  Fructose has a much greater lipogenic effect than glucose. Accordingly, researchers have discovered that fructose causes a higher rise in circulating triglyceride levels, compared to glucose ( 4 , 7 ).  Bottom Line: Eating a lot of fructose raises of your blood levels of triglycerides, which is a risk factor for heart disease.  Blood Sugar Control  Blood sugar control refers to the body’s ability to keep blood sugar levels within healthy limits.  Poor blood sugar control is associated with worsened insulin sensitivity, also called insulin resistance.  Several human trials have shown that excessive fructose consumption leads to insulin resistance in the liver ( 4 , 5 , 10 ).  One 10-week intervention study in overweight and obese individuals showed that following a high-fructose diet, with 25% of its total calories in the form of fructose, significantly increased fasting blood sugar levels and insulin levels, as seen below.   This rise in blood sugar and insulin was accompanied with worsened insulin sensitivity ( 4 ).  Another 3-week study tested the effects of a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages, providing either 40 or 80 grams of fructose per day, and compared it with 80 grams of glucose ( 10 ).  The amount of fructose corresponded to 9 and 14% of the total calorie intake, respectively.  Insulin resistance was evident in those who got 80 grams of fructose per day, whereas the same amount of glucose had no significant effects ( 4 ).  Bottom Line: Regularly eating high amounts of fructose leads to insulin resistance, contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes.  How Much Fructose is Too Much?  Most interventional studies have tested the health effects of high amounts of fructose, corresponding to 25-35% of people’s daily calorie intake ( 4 , 5 , 8 ).  In comparison, the average intake of fructose in the US is approximately 50-60 grams per day, corresponding to roughly 10% of people’s total calorie intake ( 1 ).  For this reason, some people have questioned the findings. Recent studies have acknowledged the issue and examined the effects of lower doses of fructose.  One study in young, lean subjects compared the effects of 4 diets providing varying amounts of fructose: 0%, 4.5%, 7.9% and 11% of calories.  The study showed dose-dependent increases in weight gain and blood lipid changes, suggesting that even low doses of fructose make a difference ( 9 ).  Another study examined the effects of a single meal containing roughly 30 grams of fructose (7.3% of the daily calorie requirements).  Several hours after the high-fructose meal, the researchers detected adverse changes in the participants’ blood lipid profile ( 15 ).  Simply put, fructose intake corresponding to the average intake in the US — 10% of total calories or 50-60 grams per day — may have adverse health effects.  Additionally, the negative health effects of high fructose intake appear rapidly, or in just a few days ( 5 , 6 , 7 ).  However, long-term studies are needed to fully evaluate the impact of high-fructose diets.  Bottom Line: Studies show that fructose has dose-dependent effects on the blood lipid profile. Even relatively low amounts of fructose, well below average intakes, may have adverse health effects.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, high fructose intake may contribute to several chronic diseases, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  It increases fat (triglyceride) formation in the liver, impairs the blood lipid profile, promotes the accumulation of belly fat (visceral fat) and leads to insulin resistance in the liver.  The richest dietary sources of fructose are sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets and processed foods with added sugar.  Cutting down on sugar-sweetened foods has multiple health benefits and is probably one of the best things you can do for your health.

	Do Ketogenic Diets Have a “Metabolic Advantage”?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 11, 2016  Previous studies show that eating more protein can help people lose weight.  Not only does protein increase the amount of calories burned , it also seems to reduce calorie intake by suppressing appetite .  The ketogenic diet is usually much higher in protein than the normal Western diet. As a result, it may help people lose weight.  However, it is unclear if the weight-loss benefits of the ketogenic diet are merely due to increased protein intake, or if it improves body composition and calorie expenditure irrespective of its protein content.  For this reason, a recent study examined the changes in calorie expenditure and weight loss when switching from a high-carb diet to a low-carb, high-fat (ketogenic) diet, while keeping protein intake constant.  Below is a detailed summary of its findings as well as some background information.   Background  The rates of obesity have been rising in the past decades.  Multiple aspects of the modern lifestyle contribute to obesity. For example, physical activity has decreased and the consumption of sugar and processed junk food has been on the rise.  Eating excessive amounts of sugar is linked with an increased risk of obesity. However, since sugar contains no more calories than protein or complex carbs, gram for gram, it is still not entirely clear how it promotes weight gain.  One popular idea is that sugar is addictive for some people, increasing cravings and calorie intake. Although the hypothesis is not yet fully proved, it is supported by several lines of evidence.  Another idea is the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis of obesity. It posits that obesity is mainly caused by elevated insulin levels.  According to this hypothesis, elevated insulin levels suppress the use of fat for fuel, promoting its storage in fat tissue.  Additionally, scientists have speculated that “locking” fat in fat cells (decreasing its availability as fuel) might cause a state of starvation, leading to an adaptive decrease in calorie expenditure and an increase in calorie intake ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Article Reviewed  This study examined the effects of an extremely low-carb diet (ketogenic diet) on calorie expenditure and body composition in obese men.  Energy expenditure and body composition changes after an isocaloric ketogenic diet in overweight and obese men.  Study Design  This 2-month study examined how switching from a high-carb diet to a low-carb, high-fat diet changes calorie expenditure and body composition.  Seventeen 18-50 years old overweight and obese men, with a body mass index ranging from 25-35, participated in the study.  The study was divided into two, successive, 4-week periods:   Baseline diet: A high-carb diet with 50% of calories from carbs (25% from sugar), 35% from fat and 15% from protein.  Ketogenic diet: A high-fat diet providing 80% of total calories from fat, 15% from protein and 5% carbs.   Throughout the study, the participants were confined to a metabolic ward. Their food intake was closely monitored and all food was prepared by the study kitchen. Both diets contained minimal amounts of processed food and added sugar.  Additionally, the researchers adjusted the participants’ calorie intake so that they would be in neutral energy balance, maintaining their body weight.  Since eating higher amounts of dietary protein may increase calorie expenditure, protein intake was kept constant at 15% of total calories throughout the study.  Every week, the participants spent two days inside a metabolic chamber, and the researchers measured the following:   Respiratory quotient (RQ): Basal metabolic rate – the minimal calorie expenditure necessary to sustain life – was evaluated by calculating the RQ, which is the ratio of carbon dioxide formation to oxygen absorption in cells.  Calorie expenditure: Various components of calorie expenditure (CE) were measured in the metabolic chamber using indirect calorimetry. Average CE was measured by doubly labeled water in the final 2 weeks of each period.  Body weight: Body weight was measured after an overnight fast.  Body composition: After an overnight fast, body composition was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).  Protein use: The researchers measured the amount of nitrogen in urine over a 24 hour period. Urinary nitrogen is a marker of how much protein the body is using.  Insulin formation: To estimate how much insulin is formed over the course of a day, the researchers measured the levels of C-peptide in urine.   Bottom Line: The study tested the effects of a low-carb, high-fat, ketogenic diet on calorie expenditure and body composition in overweight and obese men.  Finding 1: The Ketogenic Diet Didn’t Increase Fat Loss  The study was designed so that the participants would maintain their weight.  However, as the study progressed the researchers discovered that the participants burned more calories than predicted. The most likely explanation is that the participants were more active when outside the metabolic chamber. This was confirmed by a 21% increase in hip accelerometer counts.  This means that the participants were underfed during the study, resulting in weight loss. Overall, the negative energy balance corresponded to roughly 300 calories every day.  The chart below shows how total body weight and body fat changed during the course of the study. The weight is presented as the difference from the start of the ketogenic diet (denoted as 0 on the horizonal axis).   When starting the ketogenic diet, there was a sudden drop in body weight (-3.5 lbs or -1.6 kg), likely caused by loss of water. Body weight then stabilized for the remainder of the study.  The researchers also measured changes in fat mass, using DEXA. Interestingly, the loss of fat mass slowed when the participants switched from the high-carb diet to the low-carb, ketogenic diet.  Bottom Line: Switching to a ketogenic diet after being on a high-carb diet did not increase fat loss. On the contrary, it slowed down body fat loss.  Finding 2: The Ketogenic Diet Slightly Increased Calorie Expenditure  Going on the ketogenic diet caused a slight increase in calorie expenditure. This amounted to approximately 100 calories per day.  Sleeping metabolic rate – calories burned while sleeping – was largely responsible for this increase. However, the increase was only temporary and calorie expenditure gradually returned to initial levels.  Additionally, body composition adjustments likely overestimated the increase in calorie expenditure because most of the weight loss was probably caused by loss of water.  In fact, previous studies suggest that eating less carbs does not increase the amount of calories burned, unless accompanied by an increase in protein intake ( 4 , 5 ).  Other studies have reported a small decrease in calorie expenditure on low-carb diet or no statistically significant change at all ( 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 8 ).  Simply put, the ketogenic diet didn’t cause a significant or physiologically relevant increase in calorie expenditure, compared to a high-carb diet, when protein intake was kept constant.  Bottom Line: The ketogenic diet caused a slight, temporary increase in fat burning, which gradually returned to initial levels. This small increase didn’t affect fat mass.  Finding 3: The Ketogenic Diet Increased Protein Breakdown  Every week, the researchers assessed protein use by the body. This was done by measuring the levels of nitrogen in the urine over a 24 hour period.  Interestingly, the levels of nitrogen in urine increased by 1.5 grams/day, on average, during the ketogenic diet, as shown in the chart below.   This indicates that the body was using greater amounts of protein. However, this increase was highest during the first week on the ketogenic diet, but then gradually returned to initial levels.  Supporting this, previous research shows that insulin reduces the protein breakdown (proteolysis) in the body ( 10 ).  Bottom Line: The ketogenic diet temporarily increased nitrogen levels in urine, suggesting an increased protein breakdown.  Finding 4: The Ketogenic Diet Reduced Daily Insulin Secretion  Daily insulin secretion, which is the total amount of insulin formed over one day, was assessed by measuring the levels of C-peptide in urine.  When the participants switched over to the ketogenic diet, their daily secretion of insulin dropped by approximately 47%.  These findings are presented in the chart below.   Bottom Line: Going on the ketogenic diet caused a significant drop in insulin levels.  Limitations  The main limitation of the study was the unintentional weight loss. The study was designed to keep the participants weight-stable, but instead they lost weight.  This was likely explained by greater physical activity when the participants were outside the metabolic chambers. A similar effect was seen in a previous study ( 11 ).  Second, the present study didn’t include a control group of participants that didn’t go on a ketogenic diet. For this reason, the study doesn’t definitely prove that all of the observed changes were caused by the ketogenic diet, although highly likely.  Third, the study included only overweight and mildly obese men. The findings do not necessarily apply to women or people who are normal-weight or severely obese.  Finally, some critics have pointed out that the fat composition of the ketogenic diet might make a difference. The possible effects of fat type on calorie expenditure need to be studied further.  Bottom Line: This study had an excellent design. However, the study lacked a control group and the participants failed to maintain their body weight.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Simply put, this study suggests that going on a high-fat (ketogenic) diet, after being on a high-carb diet, caused a slight increase in calorie expenditure.  However, calorie expenditure gradually returned to base levels. Additionally, it did not lead to an increase in fat loss. On the contrary, fat loss appeared to slow down during the ketogenic diet.  This means that going on a very low-carb diet without increasing your protein intake probably doesn’t cause any relevant changes in the amount of calories you burn.  These findings undermine the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis of obesity. On the other hand, ketogenic diets might promote weight loss by decreasing appetite and calorie intake ( 12 ).  Ketogenic diets are also associated with various other health benefits. Yet, they are hard to stick to in the long term and may not be for everyone.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (July 1st–8th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 8, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published studies and reviews in nutrition.  Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Obese and lean people’s brains respond differently to sugar.  Eating too much glucose or fructose for 8 days doesn’t increase inflammation.  Vitamin D3 supplements may improve insulin sensitivity in diabetics.  Certain gut bacteria may increase the severity of rheumatoid arthritis.  Weight loss reduces the symptoms of psoriasis, with long-term benefits.  Cold exposure may promote weight loss and gut microbiota changes.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed one study about the effects of sugar on brain activity and another about how sugar affects inflammation.   Review:  Obese People’s Brains Respond Differently to Sugar.  Article:  Altered Brain Response to Drinking Glucose and Fructose in Obese Adolescents.  Summary: This observational study examined how glucose or fructose affects brain activity in obese and lean adolescents.  Both affected brain activity (brain blood flow) differently in obese and lean people. The authors concluded that obese teens are more likely to give in to sugar cravings.   Review:  Does Excessive Sugar Intake Cause Inflammation?  Article:  No differential effect of beverages sweetened with fructose, high-fructose corn syrup, or glucose on systemic or adipose tissue inﬂammation in normal-weight to obese adults: a randomized controlled trial.  Summary: This 8-day, randomized controlled trial tested how eating too much glucose, fructose or high-fructose corn syrup affects inflammatory markers.  The study showed that short-term, excessive sugar consumption does not affect inflammatory markers — CRP and IL-6 — in lean and obese adults.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Arthritis  Skin Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Contaminants and Food Safety  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Food cravings in pregnancy: Preliminary evidence for a role in excess gestational weight gain.  Pregnant women answered the Food Craving Inventory, a questionnaire that quantifies the frequency of cravings and how often people give in to them.  The findings indicate that cravings and eating a lot of craved foods, mainly sugar and fast food, increases the risk of excessive weight gain during pregnancy.   Altered Microbiota Contributes to Reduced Diet-Induced Obesity upon Cold Exposure.   This mouse study showed that cold exposure (4 weeks at 54°F or 12°C) was associated with changes in the gut microbiota.  When bacteria-free mice on a high-fat diet were transplanted with bacteria from cold-exposed mice, they gained less weight and had better blood sugar control than mice who got bacteria from mice housed at 84°F (29°C).   2.

This observational study in women from the Nurses’ Health Study indicates that plant-based diets may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. This especially applied to whole, unprocessed plant foods.   Vitamin D3-Supplemented Yogurt Drink Improves Insulin Resistance and Lipid Profiles in Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Double Blinded Clinical Trial.   This was a 16-week, randomized controlled trial in women with diabetes during pregnancy. It showed that eating yogurt enriched with vitamin D3 significantly improved insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles, compared to plain yogurt.   3. Heart Health  Dietary Quality Indices in Relation to Cardiometabolic Risk among Finnish Children Aged 6–8 Years – the PANIC study.   This observational study examined the association of heart disease risk with the results of 4 dietary quality indices in Finnish children. Only the Finnish Children Healthy Eating Index was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease in boys.  In contrast, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Score, Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS) and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were not significantly associated with reduced heart disease risk in children.   Whole Grain Intake and Mortality From All Causes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.   This meta-analysis of other studies showed that eating a lot of whole-grain cereals was associated with a lower risk of death, especially from heart disease.   4. Cancer  The effects of oral glutamine on clinical and survival outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy.   Glutamine is an amino acid used in protein synthesis. Cells that are rapidly dividing often use glutamine as an energy source.  This study in lung cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy showed that taking 10 grams of glutamine, 3 times a day for over a year, reduced the risk of weight loss and severe esophagitis . It also improved survival outcomes.   5. Appetite and Eating  Effects of Bite Count Feedback from a Wearable Device and Goal Setting on Consumption in Young Adults.   This study suggests that using an electronic device providing a bite count feedback while eating may reduce calorie intake during a single meal.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Association of Vitamin B12, Folate, and Sulfur Amino Acids With Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Measures in Older Adults: A Longitudinal Population-Based Study.  This observational study in people aged 60 years or older showed that higher circulating levels of vitamin B12 were linked to decreased total brain volume loss.  In contrast, higher homocysteine levels were linked to faster total brain volume loss. Randomized controlled trials need to confirm these findings.   Feeding the Brain – The effects of micronutrient interventions on cognitive performance among school-aged children: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.   This review of randomized controlled trials concluded that micronutrient deficiencies may impair fluid intelligence — the capacity to solve problems in new situations.  Studies still need to evaluate how micronutrients affect other aspects of intelligence.   7. Digestive Health  The efficacy and safety of probiotics for prevention of chemoradiotherapy-induced diarrhea in people with abdominal and pelvic cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This review and meta-analysis evaluated the safety of probiotics for preventing diarrhea in people undergoing chemoradiotherapy for abdominal or pelvic cancer.  The reviewers concluded that probiotics may be useful for preventing or reducing chemoradiotherapy-induced diarrhea and adverse side effects are uncommon.   8. Kidney and Urinary Health  The consumption of fish cooked by different methods was related to the risk of hyperuricemia in Japanese adults: A 3-year follow-up study.   Hyperuricemia is when there are abnormally high levels of uric acid in the blood. Untreated cases may increase the risk of gout and kidney failure.  This observational study in Japanese adults showed that eating raw or roasted fish, but not boiled or fried fish, was associated with a higher risk of hyperuricemia.   9. Arthritis  Dysbiosis contributes to arthritis development via activation of autoreactive T cells in the intestine.   Previous studies have shown that the types of intestinal bacteria in your gut may influence arthritis. For example, some early rheumatic arthritis patients have a gut microbiota dominated by Prevotella copri .  In this study, transplanting fecal bacteria from arthritic humans into mice increased inflammation and arthritis severity, compared to bacteria from healthy humans.   10. Skin Health  Long-term effects of weight reduction on the severity of psoriasis in a cohort derived from a randomized trial: a prospective observational follow-up study.   Psoriasis is characterized by patches of red and scaly skin. Previous randomized controlled trials have shown that weight loss may reduce the severity of psoriasis.  This observational follow-up study suggests that long-term weight loss has sustained benefits for psoriasis.   11. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Sugary beverage and food consumption, and leukocyte telomere length maintenance in pregnant women.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands that protect them from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate this, possibly contributing to aging.  This observational study in overweight and obese pregnant women showed that drinking less sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with increased telomere length in white blood cells. This didn’t apply to other sugary foods.   Effect of Calorie Restriction on Mood, Quality of Life, Sleep, and Sexual Function in Healthy Nonobese Adults.  Calorie restriction increases longevity in many animals and reduces disease risk. This 2-year, randomized controlled trial tested the health effects of 25% restriction.  Compared to the control, calorie restriction led to greater weight loss and improved general health. It also reduced tension and improved relationships, sexual drive and sleep. It had no negative effects on health-related quality of life.   12. Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Amino acid changes during transition to a vegan diet supplemented with fish in healthy humans.   Obese people and diabetics tend to have high levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), aromatic amino acids and sulfur amino acids.  This study showed that going on a vegan diet, supplemented with fish, lowered circulating levels of BCAAs. These findings suggest that high levels of BCAAs result from a diet high in meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products.   13. Contaminants and Food Safety  Association of Rice and Rice-Product Consumption With Arsenic Exposure Early in Life.  Rice is commonly eaten by infants and is a major ingredient in many infant foods. It may also contain high levels of inorganic arsenic. Chronic, high intake of arsenic has been associated with many health problems.  This observational study showed that arsenic levels were higher in the urine of children who ate infant rice cereal. Arsenic levels in rice snacks ranged from 36 to 568 ng/g of organic arsenic and 5–201 ng/g of inorganic arsenic.   14. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Mangiferin: A xanthonoid with multipotent anti-inflammatory potential.   Mangiferin is a yellow polyphenol antioxidant found in mangoes. This review discussed the potential health benefits of maniferin.  Like other polyphenols, it might help reduce the risk of chronic diseases through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, human studies are lacking.   Short-term ubiquinol supplementation reduces oxidative stress associated with strenuous exercise in healthy adults: A randomized trial.   Coenzyme Q10 exists in three forms, one of which is called ubiquinol. In the body, ubiquinol plays a role in energy production and antioxidant defenses. Dietary sources include liver, meat, fish, parsley and broccoli.  This randomized controlled trial in healthy, well-trained people showed that taking 200 mg of ubiquinol before exercise, every day for 2 weeks, decreased oxidative stress and increased circulating levels of nitric oxide .

	Does Excessive Sugar Intake Cause Inflammation?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 6, 2016  Inflammation underlies most diseases.  The purpose of inflammation is to help the body heal and protect against further damage. However, chronic inflammation is harmful and involved in the development of many lifestyle diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes.  Recently, researchers tested the effects of sugar on inflammatory markers. Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Regularly eating a lot of sugar has adverse health effects.  It’s linked with increased calorie intake and obesity, as well as low-grade, chronic inflammation.  However, not all sugar is the same. Several types of sugar are found in your diet, the most common of which are:   Glucose: This is the most important sugar in your body and used by most cells for fuel. It also makes up your blood sugar. Glucose is stored in your muscles and liver as glycogen.  Fructose: Also known as fruit sugar, fructose is found in many plants and often connected to glucose in the form of sucrose. Since your body’s cells (except for sperm cells) cannot use fructose, it is changed into glucose by the liver.  Sucrose: Commonly known as table sugar, sucrose is composed of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule connected together. In the gut, digestive enzymes split sucrose into glucose and fructose.   These three sugars are found in numerous syrups and sugar-based sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup, which usually contains about 55% fructose and 42% glucose.  Scientists believe that too much fructose leads to low-grade, chronic inflammation. This idea is partly supported by observational studies in humans and controlled experiments in animals ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Additionally, animal experiments suggest that eating high amounts of fructose may weaken the gut wall (intestinal barrier) and allow bacterial toxins to “leak” into the blood, causing systemic inflammation ( 3 , 4 ).  However, convincing human evidence is lacking. To date, randomized controlled trials have failed to prove that fructose itself causes inflammation ( 5 , 6 ).  Article Reviewed  This study compared the effects of different types of sugar – glucose, fructose and high-fructose corn syrup – on markers of inflammation.  No differential effect of beverages sweetened with fructose, high-fructose corn syrup, or glucose on systemic or adipose tissue inﬂammation in normal-weight to obese adults: a randomized controlled trial.  Study Design  This randomized controlled crossover trial examined the effects of different types of sugar — fructose and glucose — on markers of inflammation.  Obesity and fat gain, especially in the belly area, is associated with inflammation. To isolate the effects of sugar, the researchers tested participants’ short-term (8-day) intake of sugar before they started to gain significant amounts of fat.  The study recruited 24 lean to obese men and women aged 18–65. None of them had fructose malabsorption.  The participants were assigned to one of three 8-day study periods in a random order. During each study period, they were asked to consume sugar-sweetened beverages, which differed by the type of sugar used:   Fructose  Glucose: Aspartame was added to match the sweetness of the fructose beverage.  High-fructose corn syrup: 55% fructose, 41% glucose. Aspartame was added to match the sweetness of the fructose beverage.   Each of the beverages accounted for 25% of the participants’ estimated calorie requirements per day. Otherwise, the participants followed a standardized diet provided by the research kitchen.  Since the study had a crossover design, the participants consumed all three beverages during different study periods, separated by a 20-day washout period.  At the start and end of each period, the researchers measured the following:   Inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and adiponectin.  Fat tissue inflammation: 14 participants agreed to undergo a belly skin fat biopsy to measure fat tissue inflammation.  Intestinal permeability: The researchers measured markers of intestinal permeability ( zonulin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)) and also did the lactulose-mannitol test.   Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial testing the effects of excessive, short-term sugar intake on inflammatory markers.  Finding 1: Sugar Did Not Increase Inflammatory Markers  Participants’ levels of inflammatory markers remained unchanged during the study.  Specifically, drinking high amounts of beverages sweetened with glucose, fructose or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) did not affect the circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or adiponectin, as shown in the charts below:    Similarly, excessive sugar intake did not significantly affect inflammation in fat tissue.  Supporting these findings, one previous study in obese and overweight people showed that consuming fructose-sweetened beverages for 10 weeks did not affect CRP or IL-6 ( 6 ).  However, in the same study, fructose consumption increased belly fat and the levels of several pro-inflammatory compounds (PAI-1 and MCP-1) associated with visceral belly fat ( 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Another study found that high fructose and glucose consumption for 4 weeks did not affect CRP. Visceral belly fat did not change and PAI-1 and MCP-1 remained unchanged ( 5 ).  Taken together, these findings suggest that fructose itself does not promote inflammation. However, it might promote inflammation through its effects on belly fat.  Bottom Line: The study showed that short-term (8-day), excessive intakes of fructose or glucose (dissolved in water) did not affect the inflammatory markers CRP and IL-6.  Finding 2: Sugar Intake Did Not Affect Markers of Intestinal Permeability  Intestinal permeability refers to the ability of the intestinal barrier to control the movement of water-soluble substances from the intestines into the blood.  When intestinal permeability is higher than normal, such as when the bowels are damaged or weakened, it is sometimes called a “leaky gut.”  Several tests can be used to assess intestinal permeability. The most common test is the lactulose-mannitol test, but the current study also measured circulating levels of zonulin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) ( 10 ).  The researchers discovered that eating excessive amounts of fructose, glucose or high-fructose corn syrup did not affect markers of intestinal permeability. These findings are presented in the charts below.    Previous animal experiments indicate that excessive fructose intake may cause inflammation in the gut wall, increasing its permeability.  This may allow bacterial toxins (endotoxins) to escape across the gut barrier into the blood circulation, causing systemic inflammation ( 3 , 4 ).  However, the present study suggests that 8-day, excessive intakes of fructose don’t similarly affect humans.  Bottom Line: Excessive consumption of sugar (fructose or glucose) for 8 days did not affect markers of intestinal permeability.  Limitations  This study had no apparent methodological limitations. However, the findings should be interpreted cautiously.  The testing periods were short. Therefore, the study doesn’t rule out that excessive sugar intake may increase inflammation and intestinal permeability when eaten for longer periods.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that eating excessive amounts of sugar — fructose and/or glucose — for 8 days did not affect markers of low-grade, chronic inflammation in lean and obese adults.  It is likely that some of the adverse effects of high fructose consumption develop slowly over a long period, perhaps in association with increased liver fat and visceral fat.  However, there is no doubt that eating less sugar has immediate health benefits , especially in obese individuals who regularly eat high amounts of sugar.  Tags: Inflammation , Sugar

	Obese People’s Brains Respond Differently to Sugar  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 4, 2016  Many people believe that excessive sugar intake is one of the main reasons for the “obesity epidemic.”  This is not because sugar is high in calories. Instead, evidence suggests that sugar may increase cravings and promote higher overall calorie intake.  Recently, a team of researchers examined the effects of sugar — glucose and fructose — on brain activity in lean and obese adolescents. Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  High intakes of sugar, especially sugar-sweetened beverages, have been associated with an increased risk of becoming overweight or obese.  The two most common forms of simple sugars (monosaccharides) in the diet are glucose and fructose. In foods, they often occur together or are combined in the form of sucrose (table sugar).  Some researchers have suggested that sugar may be addictive, similarly to some narcotic drugs, explaining its link to obesity ( 1 , 2 ).  Although several studies support this idea, strong evidence is still lacking.  Article Reviewed  This study examined the effects of glucose and fructose on blood flow in the brain of lean and obese adolescents.  Altered Brain Response to Drinking Glucose and Fructose in Obese Adolescents.  Study Design  This observational study investigated the effects of eating glucose and fructose on brain blood flow and appetite hormones in lean and obese adolescents.  A total 38 adolescents were recruited — 14 lean and 24 obese. They were 13–19 years old and apparently healthy.  On separate occasions after an overnight fast, the participants consumed 75 grams of glucose or 75 grams of fructose, dissolved in 300 ml of cherry-flavored water.  Afterwards, the researchers measured the following:   Brain blood flow: The researchers assessed cerebral blood flow (brain perfusion) in different brain regions, using pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) and functional MRI. The brain scans took an hour.  Glucose: Every 10 minutes the researchers took blood samples to measure blood sugar (glucose).  Fructose: Circulating levels of fructose were measured 20, 40 and 60 minutes after drinking the glucose and fructose beverages.  Appetite hormones: Ghrelin, insulin, leptin and adiponectin were also measured in blood samples.  Self-rated appetite: At the beginning and end of each session, the participants were asked to rate their feelings of hunger, satiety and fullness using a visual analog scale.   Bottom Line: This observational study examined the effects of eating glucose and fructose on brain activity in lean and obese adolescents.  Finding 1: Obese Adolescents’ Brains Responded Differently to Sugar  The researchers discovered that the brains of obese adolescents responded differently to sugar consumption, compared to those of lean adolescents.  In obese individuals, eating glucose or fructose reduced blood flow in the prefrontal cortex — a brain region involved with decision making and behavioral choices.  Glucose also increased blood flow in the hypothalamus — a region involved with appetite — whereas fructose increased blood flow in the ventral striatum — a brain region involved with food rewards, cravings and pleasure ( 3 ).  In contrast, when normal-weight individuals ate the same amount of glucose, blood flow increased in the prefrontal cortex, while remaining unchanged in the hypothalamus and ventral striatum.  Interpreting these findings, the authors speculated that sugar intake may reduce conscious control of sugar intake and increase brain activity involved with food reward processing. These effects might promote the overconsumption of sugar.  The results are supported by a previous study showing that obese adolescents had higher ratings of disinhibition (lack of restraint) and impulsivity ( 4 ).  Animal studies have also found that regular sugar intake may lead to binge drinking of sugar-sweetened beverages, sugar cravings and increased consumption of other foods when sugar is not available ( 1 ).  A previous study in lean adults showed that eating glucose reduced blood flow in the hypothalamus and ventral striatum, whereas fructose did not significantly affect blood flow ( 5 ).  Taken together, the results of the current and previous studies indicate that regular and excessive sugar intake might lead to sugar addiction in some people.  Bottom Line: In obese adolescents, sugar increased brain activity in regions involved with pleasure and cravings and reduced activity in regions involved with decision making.  Finding 2: Eating Sugar Increased Hunger in Obese Adolescents  Hunger ratings increased significantly after eating glucose and fructose in obese adolescents, whereas they remained unchanged in those who were lean.  However, ratings of fullness were higher among lean adolescents after drinking the fructose beverage.  These findings suggest that sugar intake may promote excessive calorie intake in obese individuals.  Bottom Line: Eating either glucose or fructose significantly increased self-rated feelings of hunger in obese adolescents. In contrast, glucose and fructose did not affect hunger ratings in lean participants.  Finding 3: Effects on Circulating Levels of Hormones and Sugar  Blood sugar (glucose) rose similarly in both obese and lean adolescents after consuming glucose. However, insulin levels were slightly higher in those who were obese.  A similar but insignificant increase in blood sugar was seen after eating the fructose.  Normally, glucose and fructose consumption reduces the levels of ghrelin — the hunger hormone. Compared to lean adolescents, this suppression of ghrelin levels was lower in obese adolescents.  These changes were associated with changes in blood flow in several brain regions — the hypothalamus, thalamus and hippocampus.  The authors speculated that changes in ghrelin and insulin may possibly contribute to the differences in brain activity. However, the role of insulin and ghrelin in obesity is still unclear.  Bottom Line: The hormones ghrelin and insulin might be involved with the glucose and fructose-related changes in brain activity. However, their exact role is still poorly understood.  Limitations  The main limitation of the current study is its assessment of brain activity. It measured neuronal activity indirectly by assessing brain blood flow (brain perfusion), a marker of neuronal activity.  Second, the study didn’t include a control group and the data was observational. For this reason, we cannot rule out that factors other than sugar affected brain blood flow.  Third, the researchers didn’t measure eating behavior directly.  Finally, the simple sugars glucose and fructose are usually not eaten in isolation. Rather, they’re found in foods or consumed together as sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that sugar (fructose and glucose) has different effects on brain activity in obese and lean adolescents.  Specifically, sugar intake among obese individuals was associated with increased activity (blood flow) in brain regions involved with pleasure and food-reward processing and reduced activity in regions involved with decision making.  These findings indicate that obese adolescents are more likely to succumb to cravings and eat excessive amounts of sugar. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings by measuring eating behavior directly.  Although it’s easier said than done, limiting your sugar intake is one of the most important things you can do to lose weight.  Tags: Obesity , Sugar

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (June 24th – July 1st)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  July 1, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published nutrition research.  Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Supplementing with L-carnitine may have modest weight loss benefits.  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has stronger anti-inflammatory effects than eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).  Eating antioxidant-rich chocolate in the morning may reduce some of the negative health effects of sleep deprivation.  The thickness of beverages reduces appetite more than their calorie density.  Eating sucrose leads to faster depletion of liver glycogen after exercise, compared to eating glucose.  Taking multivitamins every day may reduce the risk of major heart disease events in men.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two articles: one meta-analysis on the effects L-carnitine on weight loss and one randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammatory markers and blood lipids.   Review:  L-Carnitine: Is it Effective for Weight Loss?  Article:  The effect of (L-)carnitine on weight loss in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Summary: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of L-carnitine on weight loss.  The review concluded that supplementing with L-carnitine for one month or longer may promote modest weight loss.   Review:  DHA is Better at Reducing Inflammation Than EPA.  Article:  Randomized, crossover, head-to-head comparison of EPA and DHA supplementation to reduce inﬂammation markers in men and women: the Comparing EPA to DHA Study.  Summary: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of the long-chain fatty acids DHA and EPA on inflammatory markers and blood lipids.  The study showed that DHA had stronger anti-inflammatory effects than EPA. Additionally, it had greater effects on the blood lipid profile.   New Research from Around the World  Many new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Eyes and Vision  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Inflammation  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Sleep    1. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effect of a Brown Rice Based Vegan Diet and Conventional Diabetic Diet on Glycemic Control of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A 12-Week Randomized Clinical Trial.  This 12-week, randomized controlled trial in Korean diabetics compared the effects of a vegan diet (based on brown rice) and a traditional diabetic diet, recommended by the Korean Diabetes Association, on the levels of HbA1c .  HbA1c is a marker of average blood sugar levels for the preceding three months. The study showed that both diets reduced HbA1c levels, but the decrease was larger in the vegan group.   Genetic susceptibility to diabetes and long-term improvement of insulin resistance and {beta} cell function during weight loss: the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS LOST) trial.  A high-protein diet is considered beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes and may improve several risk factors for diabetes.  This study showed that individuals with a high genetic risk score for type 2 diabetes benefited more from a high-protein weight-loss diet, compared to others. Similarly, they did not benefit as much from a low-protein weight-loss diet.   Plasma alkylresorcinols, biomarkers of whole-grain wheat and rye intake, and risk of type 2 diabetes in Scandinavian men and women.  Alkylresorcinols (ARs) are a group of phenolic lipids mainly found in cereals, such as wheat, rye and barley. Since they are otherwise rare in nature, their blood levels are used as markers of whole-grain wheat and rye intake.  This observational study showed that levels of total ARs were not associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, based on the levels of rye ARs, it suggests that a high intake of whole-grain rye may protect against T2D.   2. Heart Health  Association between serum calcium concentration and risk of incident and fatal cardiovascular disease in the prospective AMORIS study.  Calcium is a dietary mineral found in high amounts in dairy products. Some previous observational studies have linked high levels of circulating calcium with an increased risk of heart disease.  This large observational study supported earlier studies showing that high levels of calcium were linked with an increased risk of heart disease. However, the cause and effect relationship is unclear.   Dietary phosphatidylcholine and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality among US women and men.  Trimethylamin (TMA) is a compound produced by gut bacteria when they break down certain nutrients, mainly phosphatidylcholine (PC). Previous studies have linked high circulating levels of TMA with an increased risk of heart disease.  This large observational study in US men and women suggests that a high intake of PC is associated with an increased risk of death from heart disease, especially among diabetics. PC is mainly found in eggs, red meat and fish.   Multivitamin Use and the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Men.  This observational study in men 40 years of age or older from the Physician’s Health Study suggests that supplementing with multivitamins for 20 years or longer may reduce the risk of major heart disease events.   3. Cancer  Prospective Study of Glycemic Load, Glycemic Index, and Carbohydrate Intake in Relation to Risk of Biliary Tract Cancer.  The glycemic index (GI) is a relative measure of how fast blood sugar levels rise after eating a given amount of a certain type of food. The glycemic load (GL) is a similar measure obtained by multiplying the GI with the amount of food eaten.  This observational study found that eating a lot of foods high on the glycemic index or with a high glycemic load was associated with an increased risk of biliary tract cancer, cancer in the ducts that transport bile into the small intestine.   Plasma Riboflavin and Vitamin B-6, but Not Homocysteine, Folate, or Vitamin B-12, Are Inversely Associated with Breast Cancer Risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Varese Cohort.  This observational study showed that high circulating levels of vitamin B6 and riboflavin were associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, especially in premenopausal women.   Markers of Vitamin D Exposure and Esophageal Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.   This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that there are no consistent associations between vitamin D intake and cancer in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.   Dietary Fat Intake During Adolescence and Breast Density Among Young Women.  This prospective observational study measured fat intake and breast density in women when they were 10–18 years old and again when they were 25–29 years old.  A higher intake of saturated fat and a lower intake of mono and polyunsaturated fats during adolescence were linked with higher breast density 15 years later. These changes might affect breast cancer risk, but further studies are needed.   4. Appetite and Eating  Empty calories and phantom fullness: a randomized trial studying the relative effects of energy density and viscosity on gastric emptying determined by MRI and satiety.  This study tested the effects of dairy-based drinks, varying in viscosity (thickness) and calorie density, on fullness (satiety) and the rate of stomach emptying.  It showed that high viscosity reduced stomach emptying less than high-calorie density. However, highly viscous drinks were more effective at reducing self-perceived fullness.   5. Eyes and Vision  Association of low oleic acid intake with diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients: a case–control study.  Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, is a complication of diabetes characterized by damage to the retina of the eye. It may eventually lead to blindness.  This observational study showed that DR was associated with a low dietary intake of fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), palmitic acid and oleic acid.   6. Digestive Health  From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites.  Growing evidence links the gut microbiota — the bacteria that inhabit our digestive tract — with body function and disease. Simply put, the types of bacteria that live in your gut produce compounds that affect your body.  These include short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This scientific review discusses the potential role of SCFAs in health and disease.   Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is inversely associated with mucosal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation and small ulcers in the lining of the colon. Bloody diarrhea is the main symptom of an active disease.  This observational study in 230 people with UC showed that low circulating levels of vitamin D were associated with greater disease severity.   7. Kidney and Urinary Health  Serum Magnesium Levels and Hospitalization and Mortality in Incident Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A Cohort Study.  Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a procedure used to clean the blood of patients with severe chronic kidney disease.  This observational study in patients undergoing PD showed that low circulating magnesium levels were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization.   8. Liver Health  Vitamin D Deficiency Is Associated With Increased Risk of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis in Adults With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Possible Role for MAPK and NF-κB?  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis .  This observational study found that vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with NAFLD. It was also associated with greater disease severity.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  The effects of phosphatidic acid supplementation on strength, body composition, muscular endurance, power, agility, and vertical jump in resistance trained men.  Studies show that phosphatidic acid (PA) promotes muscle protein formation, potentially increasing muscle mass and strength. MaxxTOR(R) is a supplement that mainly contains PA but also leucine, HMB and vitamin D3.  This randomized controlled trial in 18 strength-trained men showed that supplementing with MaxxTOR(R) for 8 weeks, while strength training three times per week, increased lean body mass and strength, compared to a placebo.   Sucrose ingestion after exhaustive exercise accelerates liver, but not muscle glycogen repletion compared with glucose ingestion in trained athletes.  The body stores carbs in the form of glycogen (long chains of glucose), mainly in the liver and muscles. High glycogen stores are very important for long-distance athletes, who sometimes experience glycogen depletion, referred to as “hitting the wall.”  This study in trained male cyclists showed that eating sucrose led to faster depletion of liver glycogen after exercise, compared to eating glucose. However, glycogen depletion in muscles was similar after eating glucose and sucrose.   10. Inflammation  Paleolithic and Mediterranean Diet Pattern Scores Are Inversely Associated with Biomarkers of Inflammation and Oxidative Balance in Adults.  This observational study suggests that Paleolithic and Mediterranean dietary patterns are associated with lower levels of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.   Breastfeeding and Risk of Kawasaki Disease: A Nationwide Longitudinal Survey in Japan.  Kawasaki disease is a rare autoimmune condition, most often seen in Asian children under 5 years of age. It is a common cause of heart disease in children, causing inflammation throughout the body and affecting blood vessels and skin.  This observational study in Japanese children showed that breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization due to Kawasaki disease, compared to formula feeding.   11. Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Prenatal Fish Oil Supplementation and Allergy: 6-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Controlled Trial.  Previous randomized controlled trials suggest that supplementing with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in pregnancy may reduce the risk of allergies in the child. The affected allergies were characterized by an immunoglobin E (IgE) response.  This study suggests that maternal long-chain omega-3 supplementation has no effect on the risk of IgE-associated allergies when the child is 6 years old.   12. Sleep  Flavanol-rich chocolate acutely improves arterial function and working memory performance counteracting the effects of sleep deprivation in healthy individuals.  This study examined whether eating chocolate rich in cocoa antioxidants (flavanols) could reduce some of the adverse effects of sleep deprivation.  The study showed that eating flavonol-rich chocolate reduced some of the negative health effects of sleep deprivation. Specifically, it reduced blood pressure and improved blood vessel function and working memory in women.   Tags: Weekly recap

	DHA is Better at Reducing Inflammation Than EPA  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 29, 2016  DHA and EPA are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that are well known for their health benefits.  Both are found in fatty fish, as well as fish oil supplements. Most research has examined their combined health effects, but few studies have compared them.  Recently, a large Canadian study compared the effects of DHA and EPA on inflammatory markers and blood lipids.  Here is a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  Many scientists believe that chronic, low-grade inflammation is a key factor in the development of lifestyle diseases, such as heart disease ( 1 , 2 ).  Several unhealthy lifestyle habits contribute to inflammation. One of them is the excessive consumption of omega-6 oils, relative to omega-3.  Excessive omega-6 intake is a consequence of the modern, processed diet. If you eat a lot of processed food and vegetable oils — mainly soybean, sunflower or corn oil — you are almost certainly getting too much omega-6.  Unlike omega-6, long-chain omega-3 fats are anti-inflammatory. There are two main types of long-chain omega-3 fats ( 3 , 4 ):   Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)   Both EPA and DHA are found in seafood, fatty fish, fish oil and certain types of marine microalgae.  The body can also produce them from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in many plant oils. However, the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is inefficient. It’s best to get EPA and DHA from your diet or supplements, rather than relying on ALA.  Few studies have compared the anti-inflammatory potential of EPA and DHA. Most have investigated mixtures of EPA and DHA or included only one of them ( 4 ).  Some studies suggest that DHA may be more effective at improving the blood lipid profile, but little is known about their individual effects on inflammation ( 5 ).  Article Reviewed  This study compared the effects of EPA or DHA supplementation on inflammatory markers and blood lipids.  Randomized, crossover, head-to-head comparison of EPA and DHA supplementation to reduce inﬂammation markers in men and women: the Comparing EPA to DHA Study.  Study Design  This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial examining the effects of supplementing with EPA or DHA on markers of inflammation in healthy men and women.  The study recruited 48 men and 106 women with abdominal obesity and low-grade chronic inflammation.  They were randomly assigned to three groups:   EPA: This group took three 1-gram capsules, providing a total of 2.7 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) every day for 10 weeks.  DHA: This group took three 1-gram capsules, providing a total of 2.7 grams of decahexaenoic acid (DHA) every day for 10 weeks.  Control: This group took three 1-gram capsules, providing a total of 3 grams of corn oil every day for 10 weeks. Corn oil is rich in omega-6 but contains very low amounts of omega-3.   The study had a crossover design, which means that the participants were assigned to all three treatments in a random order. Each treatment period was separated by a 9-week washout period.  During the study, the participants were asked to exclude all major sources of omega-3 from their diet.  At the start and end of each study period, the researchers measured the following:   Inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and adiponectin.  Blood lipids: Triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB). LDL-cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation.   Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of the omega-3 fats DHA and EPA on inflammatory markers and blood lipids.  Finding 1: DHA Reduced Inflammation More Than EPA  Supplementing with DHA caused a significantly greater reduction in inflammatory markers than EPA.  Specifically, DHA and EPA supplementation had the following effects, compared to the control (corn oil):   Interleukin-18 (IL-18): -7.0% with DHA, while EPA had no significant effects.  Interleukin-6 (IL-6): -12.0% with DHA and -13.4% with EPA.  Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α): -14.8% with DHA, but EPA had no effects.  C-reactive protein (CRP): -7.9% with DHA, while EPA had no significant effects.  Adiponectin (AN): +3.1% with DHA, while EPA had no significant effects.   These findings are presented in the charts below:    Three previous trials have compared the effects of supplementing with DHA or EPA on inflammatory markers. Supplementing with EPA or DHA did not affect any inflammatory markers ( 6 , 7 , 8 ).  However, those studies recruited only 25 or fewer participants for each group and had far less statistical power than the present study.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with DHA had a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than EPA.  Finding 2: DHA Improved the Blood Lipid Profile More Than EPA  Supplementing with DHA improved the blood lipid profile more than supplementing with EPA.  Specifically, DHA and EPA supplementation had the following effects, compared to control (corn oil):   Triglycerides (TG): -13.3% with DHA and -11.9% with EPA.  Total cholesterol (TC): +3.8% with DHA, while EPA had no significant effects.  HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C): +7.6% with DHA, while EPA had no effects.  LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C): +6.9% with DHA and +2.2% with EPA. DHA had a stronger effect on LDL-cholesterol in men (+12.5%), compared to women (+4.4%).  Apolipoprotein B (apoB): +4.5 with DHA, but EPA had no significant effects.  Cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio (TC:HDL-C): -2.5% with DHA, but EPA had no significant effects.   These findings are presented in the chart below:   The results are consistent with the findings of a previous meta-analysis showing that supplementing with DHA leads to a greater decrease in triglycerides and greater increases in LDL and HDL-cholesterol, compared to EPA ( 5 ).  DHA supplementation led to changes in triglycerides, apoB and LDL-cholesterol, which may suggest an increase in LDL particle size (a good change). However, future studies are needed to confirm this finding using proper measurements.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with DHA had greater effects on blood lipids than EPA. These changes appeared beneficial.  Limitations  The study had an excellent design and few methodological issues. However, the authors pointed out some minor limitations.  Circulating levels of DHA and EPA weren’t measured at the beginning of each study period. For this reason, it is unclear if the washout between treatment periods was long enough to eliminate all effects from the previous treatment period.  However, the levels of blood lipids and inflammatory markers were similar at the start of each of the periods, indicating that there were no residual effects from the previous treatment period.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, supplementing with 2.7 grams of DHA for 10 weeks was more effective than a similar dose of EPA at decreasing markers of chronic inflammation and improving the blood lipid profile in men and women with excessive belly fat.  However, more research is needed before we can claim that DHA is healthier than EPA. In fact, a recent study concluded that EPA may have greater benefits when it comes to heart disease prevention ( 9 ).  For the time being, it may be best to eat fatty fish, which provides both DHA and EPA, or choose mixed long-chain omega-3 supplements.  Tags: DHA , EPA , Inflammation

	L-Carnitine: Is it Effective for Weight Loss?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 27, 2016  L-carnitine is a nutrient and weight-loss supplement.  Some evidence suggests that supplementing with L-carnitine may promote weight loss. However, studies have provided mixed and inconclusive results.  For this reason, a group of Iranian researchers combined the results of several L-carnitine trials in a meta-analysis.  Here is a summary of their findings.   Background  L-carnitine is a nutrient found in high amounts in meat.  It has essential functions in the body and is involved with fatty acid oxidation (fat burning) and glucose metabolism ( 1 , 2 ).  However, it is not essential to your diet, since your liver and kidneys can produce it from the amino acids lysine and methionine .  Yet, some researchers believe dietary carnitine intake to be important, and evidence suggests it may promote weight loss by increasing calorie expenditure ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).  Article Reviewed  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the effect of L-carnitine on weight loss.  The effect of (L-)carnitine on weight loss in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials testing the effects of L-carnitine on weight loss.  It was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( 6 ).  Using electronic databases, the researchers searched for all relevant articles. Nine studies, which recruited a total of 911 participants, were selected based on quality criteria.  In all of the studies, the participants supplemented with L-carnitine for at least one month.  Bottom Line: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of L-carnitine on weight loss.  The Selected Studies  Nine studies were selected based on pre-specified criteria. Below are summaries of some of the included studies.   Coelho Cd, et al. The supplementation of L-carnitine does not promote alterations in the resting metabolic rate and in the use of energetic substrates in physically active individuals . Arquivos Brasileiros de Endocrinologia e Metabologia , 2010.  11 physically-active Brazilians supplemented with 1.8 grams of L-carnitine per day for one month. Carnitine supplementation did not affect body composition or calorie intake, compared to a placebo.   Derosa G, et al. The effect of L-carnitine on plasma lipoprotein(a) levels in hypercholesterolemic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Clinical Therapeutics , 2003.  46 diabetic patients supplemented with 2 grams of L-carnitine per day for 3 months. Supplementing with L-carnitine did not cause a greater decrease in body mass index (BMI), compared to a placebo.   Derosa G, et al. Comparison between orlistat plus l-carnitine and orlistat alone on inflammation parameters in obese diabetic patients.  Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology , 2011.  258 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to supplement with 120 mg of orlistat three times per day, or the same amount of orlistat plus 2 grams of L-carnitine once per day, for one year.  Those who supplemented with orlistat and L-carnitine lost significantly more weight, compared to those who only took orlistat.   Derosa G, et al. Effects of combination of sibutramine and L-carnitine compared with sibutramine monotherapy on inflammatory parameters in diabetic patients.  Metabolism , 2011.  254 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of sibutramine plus 2 grams of carnitine, or sibutramine alone, every day for one year. Supplementing with L-carnitine led to significantly greater weight loss.   Elmslie JL, et al. Carnitine does not improve weight loss outcomes in valproate-treated bipolar patients consuming an energy-restricted, low-fat diet.  Bipolar Disorders , 2006.  30 patients with bipolar disorder supplemented with 6.8 mg of L-carnitine per pound (15 mg per kilogram) of body weight daily for 26 weeks while following a moderately calorie-reduced diet.  Supplementing with L-carnitine did not significantly affect weight loss, compared to a placebo.   Pistone G, et al. Levocarnitine administration in elderly subjects with rapid muscle fatigue: effect on body composition, lipid profile and fatigue.  Drugs & Aging , 2003.  42 healthy older people supplemented with 4 grams of L-carnitine every day for one month while following an exercise program.  Those who supplemented with L-carnitine lost significantly more fat mass and gained greater muscle mass, compared to a placebo.   Rafraf M, et al. Effect of L-carnitine supplementation in comparison with moderate aerobic training on serum inflammatory parameters in healthy obese women.  The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness , 2015.  22 obese women from Iran supplemented with 2 grams of L-carnitine per day for two months. Half of them followed an aerobic training program.  Supplementing with L-carnitine alone, or in combination with aerobic training, did not significantly affect body weight.   Villani RG, et al. L-Carnitine supplementation combined with aerobic training does not promote weight loss in moderately obese women.  International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism , 2000.  18 overweight Australian women supplemented with 4 grams of L-carnitine for two months. They also walked for 30 minutes four days per week. Supplementing with L-carnitine did not affect total body mass or fat mass.   Finding: L-Carnitine May Cause Weight Loss  Supplementing with L-carnitine led to a 1.33 kg greater weight loss, on average, compared to a placebo.  L-carnitine supplementation led to significant weight loss in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, as well as obese and normal-weight people.  Additionally, the analysis indicated that the weight loss effects of L-carnitine are strongest in the beginning but decrease over time.  However, the relevance of these findings is unclear because the included studies varied widely in their design.  Bottom Line: This meta-analysis concluded that supplementing with L-carnitine may cause slight weight loss.  Limitations  The main limitation of this meta-analysis was its study selection.  The included studies differed in their methods and not all were weight-loss trials. This makes interpreting the findings difficult.  The meta-analysis itself didn’t appear to have any methodological limitations, but the paper lacked detail, clarity and contained some incorrect references.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that supplementing with L-carnitine for more than a month may promote modest weight loss.  However, the evidence is inconclusive and limited overall. More high-quality studies are needed.  Tags: L-carnitine , Weight loss

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (June 17–24th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 24, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published nutrition research.  Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Supplementing with heat-killed probiotics may have slight weight-loss benefits.  Certain flavonoid supplements may reduce your risk of catching a cold.  Adding 10 grams of extra virgin olive oil to a meal reduces blood sugar levels afterwards.  Supplementing with vitamin D may benefit people with chronic heart failure.  High intakes of saturated fat are associated with increased loss of cartilage in osteoarthritis.  Beta-glucan, a soluble fiber from barley, improves the blood lipid profile, possibly reducing the risk of heart disease.    Research Reviews  As usual, we reviewed two studies this past week: one examining the effects of heat-killed probiotics on weight loss and another about flavonoids and colds.   Review:  Dead Probiotics Caused Weight Loss.  Article:  Antiobesity effect of Pediococcus pentosaceus , LP28 on overweight subjects: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial tested the effects of heat-killed probiotics ( Pediococcus pentosaceus ) on weight loss in overweight people.  The study showed that supplementing with dead probiotics caused slight weight loss, compared to a placebo. These findings suggest that probiotic bacteria contain bioactive compounds that provide benefits, even when they’re dead.   Review:  Flavonoids Help Fight the Common Cold.  Article:  Effect of Flavonoids on Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Immune Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigated the effects of flavonoids on upper respiratory tract infections (colds).  The study concluded that supplementing with certain types of flavonoids may help reduce the risk of catching a cold, possibly because of their anti-viral effects.   New Research from Around the World  Lots of new research came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Protein intake in early childhood and body composition at the age of 6 years: The Generation R Study.  This observational study in children suggests that a higher protein intake in early childhood is associated with higher body fat mass at the age of 6.  Animal protein was more strongly associated with later fat mass than vegetable protein. Additionally, this association was stronger in girls than boys.   Upregulation of inflammasome activity and increased gut permeability are associated with obesity in children and adolescents.  This observational study in obese and normal-weight children and adolescents indicates that obesity is associated with increased gut inflammation and permeability.  It is unclear whether this is caused by obesity itself, an unhealthy diet or if inflammation makes people predisposed to weight gain.   Impact of sugars and sugar taxation on body weight control: A comprehensive literature review.  This review concluded that sugar taxation, on its own, is an inefficient strategy to reduce obesity rates, even though sugar intake is a risk factor for obesity.   Late night overeating is associated with smaller breakfast, breakfast skipping and obesity in children. The Healthy Growth Study.  This observational study in children suggests that late night eating is associated with a smaller breakfast, breakfast skipping and obesity.   Effect of a high-fat Mediterranean diet on bodyweight and waist circumference: a prespecified secondary outcomes analysis of the PREDIMED randomised controlled trial.   This randomized controlled trial showed that following a high-fat Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil or nuts caused more weight loss and less gain in abdominal fat, compared to a lower-fat control diet.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Extra virgin olive oil improves post-prandial glycemic and lipid profile in patients with impaired fasting glucose.  This randomized controlled trial in pre-diabetic individuals showed that taking 10 grams of extra virgin olive oil with a meal reduced blood sugar levels and increased the levels of insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1).  Additionally, virgin olive oil significantly reduced triglyceride levels and apolipoprotein B-48. Taken together, these findings suggest that extra virgin olive oil improves blood sugar control in people with impaired fasting blood sugar.   Effect of low-glycemic-sugar-sweetened beverages on glucose metabolism and macronutrient oxidation in healthy men.  Inactivity reduces insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation (fat burning). This trial in healthy men compared the effects of drinking a sugar-sweetened beverage with a high-glycemic index (high-GI-SSB) to a low-GI-SSB during a 7-day period of inactivity.  The study showed that drinking a low-GI-SSB reduced the decline in insulin sensitivity during inactivity, compared to a high-GI-SSB. In contrast, the decline in fat oxidation was similar between groups.   Plasma concentrations of coffee polyphenols and plasma biomarkers of diabetes risk in healthy Japanese women.  Previous studies suggest that coffee may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Researchers believe its high polyphenol content – mainly caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid – may be responsible for these benefits.  This observational study in Japanese women found that circulating levels of chlorogenic acid were associated with lower fasting blood sugar, HbA1c and CRP . In contrast, caffeic acid was only weakly linked with these biomarkers.   3. Heart Health  Effects of Vitamin D on Cardiac Function in Patients With Chronic HF The VINDICATE Study.  Heart failure occurs when the heart is not able to pump enough blood throughout the body. People with chronic heart failure are often deficient in vitamin D.  This controlled trial in patients with chronic heart failure and vitamin D deficiency showed that supplementing with 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily for one year significantly improved heart function.   Plasma Trimethylamine N -Oxide, a Gut Microbe–Generated Phosphatidylcholine Metabolite, Is Associated With Atherosclerotic Burden.  Previous observational studies suggest that high circulating levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) increase the risk of heart disease. Since TMAO levels depend on certain types of gut bacteria, they are only a concern in some people.  This observational study in people with coronary artery disease showed that high fasting TMAO levels were associated with worsened disease development.   A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of barley β-glucan on LDL-C, non-HDL-C and apoB for cardiovascular disease risk reduction.  Barley contains high amounts of beta-glucan, a type of viscous, soluble fiber that lowers blood cholesterol.  This systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that beta-glucan reduces levels of LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol. These findings suggest that eating barley or supplementing with beta-glucan may help reduce the risk of heart disease.   4. Appetite and Eating  Associations between Restrained Eating and the Size and Frequency of Overall Intake, Meal, Snack and Drink Occasions in the UK Adult National Diet and Nutrition Survey.  To lose weight or improve health, some people avoid certain foods, ingredients or even whole food groups. When this behavior starts affecting people’s social flexibility, it is referred to as restrained eating.  This observational study in UK adults showed that restrained eaters tended to eat smaller meals, but meal frequency was slightly higher, compared to average.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Coffee intake and the incident risk of cognitive disorders: A dose-response meta-analysis of nine prospective cohort studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies found a U-shaped association between coffee intake and cognitive disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.  The lowest risk was associated with 1–2 cups of coffee per day, whereas less than 1 cup per day or more than 3 cups per day were not significantly linked with cognitive disorders.   Dietary guanidinoacetic acid increases brain creatine levels in healthy men.  Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) is an experimental dietary supplement, which is the natural precursor of creatine in the body. Creatine helps with the formation of ATP, an enzyme that transports energy within cells.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with 16-27 mg of GGA per pound (36–60 mg per kilogram) of body weight daily for 8 weeks increased brain creatine levels by 19.1%.   6. Digestive Health  Modulation of gut microbiota dysbioses in type 2 diabetic patients by macrobiotic Ma-Pi 2 diet.  Macrobiotic diets are based on the Asian yin-yang philosophy. They mainly consist of grains, vegetables and soy, encourage mindful eating and recommend against eating several types of foods and food groups, including processed foods.  This trial showed that the macrobiotic diet Ma-Pi 2 was more effective at reducing the counts of possible pro-inflammatory gut bacteria, compared to the control diet (diabetes diet). However, both diets were effective at treating gut dysbiosis.   Dairy Products, Dietary Calcium, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results From a European Prospective Cohort Investigation.  Inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by inflammation in the digestive tract. The main symptoms are stomach pain, diarrhea and weight loss.  This observational study suggests that eating dairy products may reduce people’s risk of developing Crohn’s disease. However, dairy intake wasn’t significantly associated with ulcerative colitis.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Effects of powdered Montmorency tart cherry supplementation on acute endurance exercise performance in aerobically trained individuals.  This randomized controlled trial in endurance-trained athletes tested the effects of supplementing with 480 mg of powdered Montmorency tart cherries per day for 10 days surrounding a half-marathon race.  The study showed that supplementing with tart cherries improved race finish times and reduced pre-run soreness. Additionally, it improved antioxidant status and reduced markers of inflammation and muscle breakdown.   8. Arthritis  Dietary Fat and Progression of Knee Osteoarthritis Dietary Fat Intake and Radiographic Progression of Knee Osteoarthritis: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints. The main symptoms are joint swelling, stiffness and pain.  This observational study suggests that a high fat intake, especially saturated fat intake, is associated with increased cartilage loss and OA. In contrast, high intakes of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats were linked with reduced OA progression.   9. Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Influence of Alcohol Consumption on the Risk of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus among Women in the Nurses’ Health Study Cohorts.  Systemic lupus erythema (SLE) is an auto-immune disease. Similar to other auto-immune diseases, the body’s immune system attacks healthy tissues throughout the body. Symptoms include skin rash, fatigue, swollen joints, fever and mouth ulcers.  This prospective observational study in women found that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol – 5  grams of ethanol or half a drink per day – was linked to a lower risk of SLE.   10. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Association Between Hypovitaminosis D in Elderly Women and Long- and Short-Term Mortality—Results from the Osteoporotic Prospective Risk Assessment Cohort.  This observational study in 75-year old Swedish women found that low circulating vitamin D levels (below 50 nmol/l) were associated with a greater risk of death of all causes.   11. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  A cross-sectional study on nutrient intake and -status in inflammatory bowel disease patients.  This study showed that people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often limit their consumption of dairy products, processed meat, soft drinks, alcohol and fast food.  People with IBD also tended to be iron deficient and low in calcium and vitamin D. For those who eat little meat and dairy, supplementing with these nutrients might provide health benefits.

	Flavonoids Help Fight the Common Cold  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 22, 2016  Most people get the common cold a few times per year.  Fortunately, there are several things you can do to reduce your risk of catching one. Most importantly, you can live a healthy lifestyle and follow a wholesome diet.  In fact, research indicates that certain nutrients can make a difference. These include flavonoids, which are found in virtually all plant foods.  Recently, researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effects of flavonoids on the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections.  Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Flavonoids are the largest category of polyphenol antioxidants in the human diet. Thousands of flavonoid compounds have been identified, all of them in plants.  They play a role in the plants’ defenses against viruses, bacteria, fungi and oxidative stress, and some of them may similarly benefit humans ( 1 ).  Accordingly, a few human trials suggest that supplementing with flavonoids may reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) ( 2 , 3 ).  URTI is a collective term describing all infections affecting the throat, tonsils, nose, vocal cords, middle ear and sinuses. They’re usually associated with a cold.  They are common in the US, affecting about 23% of people every month, on average, with most people having 2–3 URTIs each year ( 4 ).  More than 200 types of viruses are known to cause URTIs. Initially, they are rarely caused by bacteria, but opportunistic bacteria usually infect tissues when their immune defenses have been weakened by a viral infection ( 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Article Reviewed  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of flavonoid supplementation on URTIs.  Effect of Flavonoids on Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Immune Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of flavonoid supplements against upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in healthy people.  The researchers searched for all relevant studies using several electronic databases. They then assessed the studies for eligibility, based on pre-specified criteria.  For example, the studies had to be randomized controlled trials with healthy human participants, aged 18–65 years old. Additionally, the participants had to supplement with flavonoids for at least 4 days.  Out of 387 studies, only 14 qualified. Six of them looked at the effects of flavonoid supplementation on URTI incidence, duration and severity, whereas 8 exclusively looked at the effects on markers of immune function.  Using the combined findings of these studies, the researchers evaluated the effects of flavonoids on URTI incidence, duration and severity, as well as their effects on immune function.  Bottom Line: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effect of flavonoids on upper respiratory tract infections.  The Selected Studies  Here are summaries of the 6 studies that examined URTI incidence.   Nieman DC, et al. Quercetin reduces illness but not immune perturbations after intensive exercise.  Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise , 2007.   40 trained male cyclists from North Carolina supplemented with 1 gram of quercetin every day for 3 weeks. They started taking quercetin 4 days before a 3-day exercise period and stopped supplementing 2 weeks afterwards.  In the two weeks after the exercise period, URTI incidence was 5% among those who had supplemented with quercetin but 45% among those who got a placebo.   Rowe CA, et al. Specific formulation of Camellia sinensis prevents cold and flu symptoms and enhances gamma, delta T cell function: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Journal of the American College of Nutrition , 2007.  108 adults from Florida supplemented with an unspecified amount of L-theanine and epigallocatechin gallate (from green tea) twice a day for 3 months.  Supplementing with these flavonoids led to a 22.9% lower incidence of infections that lasted at least 2 days, while symptom days were 35.6% fewer, compared to a placebo.   Henson D, et al. Post-160-km race illness rates and decreases in granulocyte respiratory burst and salivary IgA output are not countered by quercetin ingestion.  International Journal of Sports Medicine , 2008.  39 US adults competing in the 160-km Western States Endurance Run supplemented with 1 gram of quercetin every day for 3 weeks before and during the race and 2 weeks afterwards.  Supplementing with quercetin did not significantly affect URTI incidence.   Nantz MP, et al. Supplementation with aged garlic extract improves both NK and γδ-T cell function and reduces the severity of cold and flu symptoms: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled nutrition intervention.  Clinical Nutrition , 2012.  112 adults from Florida supplemented with 2.56 grams of a flavonoid-rich, aged-garlic extract for 90 days. At the end of the study, illness diaries showed that the incidence of colds and flu was not significantly different, compared to a placebo.  However, supplementing with the aged-garlic extract appeared to have reduced the severity of symptoms, since the number of symptoms reported was 21% lower and sick days were 58% fewer.   Nantz MP, et al. Consumption of cranberry polyphenols enhances human γδ-T cell proliferation and reduces the number of symptoms associated with colds and influenza: a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study.  Nutrition Journal , 2013.  For 10 weeks, 45 adults from Florida supplemented with 292.5–346.5 ml of proanthocyanidins per day, 30.6–50.9 ml of anthocyanins per day and 30.6–45 ml of flavonols per day from a cranberry beverage.  Supplementing with cranberry flavonoids did not reduce the incidence of colds and flu. However, those who supplemented with flavonoids reported significantly fewer symptoms, compared to those who got a placebo.   Riede L, et al. Larch arabinogalactan effects on reducing incidence of upper respiratory infections.  Current Medicinal Research and Opinion , 2013.  187 German adults supplemented with 4.5 grams of larch tree extract for 3 months. The extract was water-based and contained unspecified amounts of taxifolin and quercetin.  Those who supplemented with larch tree extract were less likely to get a cold and be affected by the infection, compared to a placebo.  Finding: Flavonoids Reduced the Risk of Infections  This meta-analysis found that supplementing with flavonoids caused a 33% reduction in the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), on average, when compared with a placebo.  Supplementing with flavonoids also decreased sick-day count by 40%, although these findings were unclear.  Overall, flavonoid supplementation tended to reduce URTI duration and severity, but the evidence was inconclusive.  In the included trials, flavonoid supplementation ranged from 0.2–1.2 grams per day.  Bottom Line: The study showed that supplementing with flavonoids may reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections by 33%, on average.  Why Do Flavonoids Reduce the Incidence of Infections?  In the present study, the effects of flavonoids on infections were not explained by changes in markers of immune system function.  However, flavonoids have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, improving health overall. In addition, many flavonoids have antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal effects ( 1 ).  The authors speculated that flavonoids may reduce the incidence of URTIs through their antiviral effects. In fact, flavonoids, such as quercetin, hesperetin and catechin, may act against certain types of viruses ( 8 , 9 ).  Bottom Line: Why flavonoids reduce the risk of infections is not entirely clear. However, scientists have speculated that their antiviral properties may play a role.  Limitations  This meta-analysis didn’t have any obvious methodological limitations.  However, the practical application of its findings is limited. Further studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of individual flavonoids and different doses.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This meta-analysis showed that supplementing with flavonoids may reduce the risk of catching a cold.  However, there is no conclusive evidence that flavonoids reduce the severity or duration of infections.  Keep in mind that flavonoids are a large group of antioxidants with different properties. Not all flavonoids are effective against the common cold and normal dietary intakes might not be sufficient.  Regardless, a diet high in flavonoids is associated with improved health overall. Increase your intake by eating a lot of berries, nuts, fruits and vegetables and drinking beverages like coffee, tea and cocoa.  Tags: Common cold , Flavoniods , Upper respiratory tract infection

	Dead Probiotics Caused Weight Loss  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 20, 2016  Growing evidence shows that probiotics may promote weight loss .  Probiotics are defined as live bacteria that have health benefits when consumed. Research indicates they may even retain some of their health benefits when they’re dead ( 1 ).  Recently, Japanese researchers compared the weight loss benefits of a live and heat-killed probiotic known as Pediococcus pentosaceus .  Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Several species of probiotic bacteria have shown promise as weight loss supplements.  These bacteria belong to a group known as lactic acid bacteria (LAB). They produce lactic acid from carbs and are found in several fermented foods, such as yogurt, cheese and sourdough bread.  Research suggests that certain lactic acid bacteria may promote weight loss in humans. These include Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. gasseri ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Both of these are naturally found on human skin and in the digestive tract. They are also among the first bacteria to colonize the guts of breastfeeding infants ( 5 ).  Pediococcus pentosaceus is another species of LAB that has been found to be effective for weight loss in obese mice ( 6 ).  However, until now, its effects on weight loss in humans have not been studied.  Article Reviewed  This study compared the effectiveness of supplementing with heat-killed or live Pediococcus pentosaceus on weight loss in Japanese adults.  Antiobesity effect of Pediococcus pentosaceus LP28 on overweight subjects: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.  Study Design  The purpose of this 12-week, randomized controlled trial was to examine the effectiveness of supplementing with the probiotic bacteria Pediococcus pentosaceus LP28 (LP28) on weight loss in overweight individuals.  A total of 62 Japanese men and women between the ages of 20â70 were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Each group consumed one spoonful of the following every day for 12 weeks:   Live LP28: A powder containing dextrin and about 100 billion live LP28.  Heat-killed LP28: A powder containing dextrin and about 100 billion heat-killed LP28.  Placebo: A powder containing dextrin only.   At the beginning and end of the study, the researchers measured body fat mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).  They also measured waist circumference and various blood values, including fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, resistin and blood lipids.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of live and heat-killed LP28 (a probiotic) on weight loss in overweight men and women in Japan.  Finding: Supplementing with Dead LP28 Caused Weight Loss  Supplementing with the heat-killed LP28 caused a 1.7% decrease in body weight, compared to the placebo.  The loss of fat mass and waist circumference was also significant. Specifically, waist circumference decreased by 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) and body fat mass by 2.3 lbs (1.1 kg), compared to the placebo.  In contrast, weight loss among those who took live LP28 was not statistically significant. The chart below compares the differences in fat loss between groups.   This was the first study to examine the effects of LP28 in humans, but previous research in mice has suggested that LP28 may be an effective weight loss supplement ( 6 ).  None of the blood values significantly differed between groups.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with heat-killed LP28 for 12 weeks caused a 1.7% decrease in body weight, mainly due to fat loss. It didn’t affect blood sugar, insulin, lipids or appetite hormones.  How Can Dead Probiotics Cause Weight Loss?  The reason why dead LP28 were more effective than live LP28 is unknown.  The current results are supported by previous studies suggesting that probiotics may have health benefits even when they’re dead. This phenomenon has been labeled the “probiotic paradox” ( 1 ).  The probiotic paradox is likely explained by bioactive compounds that are released when the bacterial cells dissolve in the digestive system.  Like other lactic acid bacteria, Pediococcus pentasaceus produces exopolysaccharides, which are responsible for the thick and sticky texture of some fermented dairy products such as yogurt ( 7 ).  Exopolysaccharides may also affect immune responses and reduce inflammation in the digestive tract ( 8 , 9 ).  Additionally, P. pentosaceus has been widely studied for its ability to produce an antibiotic known as pediocin, which limits the growth of other bacteria ( 10 , 11 ).  Interestingly, P. pentasaceus is present in ripened cheese and some processed meats, where pediocin is thought to act as a preservative, preventing the growth of harmful bacteria such as Listeria ( 12 , 13 ).  It is unclear whether any of these compounds, or some other substances, explain the present findings.  Bottom Line: Why dead LP28 caused more weight loss than live LP28 is unclear. Plausibly, the digestion of dead LP28 caused the release of an unidentified bioactive compound.  Limitations  This study did not seem to have had any methodological limitations.  However, the participants were Japanese adults. The effectiveness of dead L28 cannot be generalized to other populations.  Finally, Hiroshima University Hospital, where the study was conducted, holds the patent on the use of LP28 as a weight-loss supplement. This also applied to three of the paper’s authors, including the main author.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study showed that supplementing with dead probiotics ( Pediococcus pentosaceus LP28) for 12 weeks caused slight but statistically significant weight loss.  In comparison, live LP28 did not lead to significant weight loss. The study supports earlier evidence that some probiotics may have health benefits, even when they are dead.  These effects are likely explained by bioactive compounds that are released from dead cells in the digestive tract. However, it is still unknown what compounds are responsible.  Further studies are needed before we can recommend dead probiotics as weight loss supplements. Also, these effects may not apply to all types of probiotics.  Tags: Probiotics , Weight loss

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (June 10th – June 17th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 17, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published nutrition research.  Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Synchronizing a weight-loss diet with the menstrual cycle may help women lose weight.  Supplementing with probiotics may help reduce the symptoms of depression.  Eating pre-packaged food portions is more effective for weight loss than self-selecting.  A very-low calorie diet can treat type 2 diabetes in some people. These benefits are sustained while following a weight-maintenance diet.  Supplementing with probiotics can reduce the duration of antibiotic-related diarrhea.  Sodium in urine is a very inaccurate marker of dietary salt intake.    Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two studies: one about the effectiveness of the Menstralean diet for weight loss and the other about probiotics and depression.   Review:  Can the Menstralean Diet Help You Lose Weight?  Article:  A weight-loss program adapted to the menstrual cycle increases weight loss in healthy, overweight, premenopausal women: a 6-mo randomized controlled trial.  Summary: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a weight loss program synchronized with the phases of the menstrual cycle (Menstralean diet).  The Menstralean diet led to more weight loss than a conventional, calorie-reduced diet. However, the Menstralean diet also provided higher amounts of protein and the novelty of the program seems to have motivated the participants.   Review:  Can Probiotics Help Reduce Depression?  Article:  Clinical and metabolic response to probiotic administration in patients with major depressive disorder: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of probiotics on the symptoms of major depressive disorder. Supplementing with probiotics led to a significant improvement in depression, compared to a placebo.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Infections and Immune Health  Skin Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Women’s Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Randomized clinical trial of portion-controlled prepackaged foods to promote weight loss.  This randomized controlled trial showed that people who got pre-packaged lunch and dinner portions during a weight-loss program lost more weight than those who selected their own food.   Effects of breast-feeding compared with formula-feeding on preterm infant body composition: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies in preterm infants suggests that formula-feeding may promote a greater fat gain when they are 1-12 month old, compared to breastfeeding.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  A high-fat, high-glycaemic index, low-fibre dietary pattern is prospectively associated with type 2 diabetes in a British birth cohort.  This observational study showed that following a diet that is high in fat, low in fiber and high in easily-digested carbs (sugar and starch) was associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  This dietary pattern was characterized by low intake of fruits, vegetables and whole-grain cereals. It also provided high amounts of white bread, fried potatoes and processed meat.   Very Low-Calorie Diet and 6 Months of Weight Stability in Type 2 Diabetes: Pathophysiological Changes in Responders and Nonresponders.  Very-low calorie diets (VLCD) can be used to treat type 2 diabetes in some people. This study examined whether the benefits of a VLCD were sustained when a group of diabetics went on a weight-stabilizing diet (WSD) after following a VLCD for 8 weeks.  During the 6 months of follow-up, 40% of the participants maintained their low blood sugar levels. These findings suggest that the benefits of a VLCD can be sustained while following a WSD for at least 6 months afterwards.   3. Heart Health  Dietary epicatechin intake and 25-y risk of cardiovascular mortality: the Zutphen Elderly Study.  Epicatechin is a flavonoid antioxidant found in plant foods, such as green tea, apples and cocoa. Studies suggest that high intake of epicatechin may reduce the risk of heart disease.  This observational study in elderly men showed that a high epicatechin intake was associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease.   Whole-grain intake and total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.  Studies examining the association of whole grain intake with the risk of death from disease have provided inconsistent results.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that eating a lot of whole-grain cereals may reduce the risk of death from heart disease and cancer.   Association of fish consumption and dietary intake of marine n-3 PUFA with myocardial infarction in a prospective Danish cohort study.  Myocardial infarction (MI) is when blood flow to the heart is disrupted.  This observational study indicates that a high intake of fatty fish is linked with a lower risk of MI. Specifically, eating relatively high amounts of fatty fish reduced the risk by 12% in men and 22% in women.   4. Cancer  Vitamin D and colorectal cancer: molecular, epidemiological and clinical evidence.  This review discussed the association of vitamin D with colon cancer. Some observational studies suggest that vitamin D may have some benefits, but this has not been proved in clinical trials.   Calcium intake and breast cancer risk: meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  Calcium is a dietary mineral found in high amounts in dairy products. This meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that a high intake of calcium may reduce the risk of breast cancer.   Coffee Drinking and Risk of Lung Cancer—A Meta-Analysis.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that drinking coffee is not associated with the risk of developing lung cancer, when tobacco smoking is taken into account.   5. Appetite and Eating  Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Associated with Added Sugars Intake among US Adults.  This observational study in US adults showed that a high intake of added sugar was linked with a number of other unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as low physical activity and smoking.  It was also more common among those who were younger, less educated or had a lower income.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Serum α-linolenic and other ω-3 fatty acids, and risk of disabling dementia: community-based nested case-control study.  Scientists have speculated that adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of dementia by protecting neurons and improving the health of blood vessels delivering blood and oxygen to the brain.  This observational study found that levels of alpha-linolenic acid were associated with a reduced risk of developing severe dementia. However, other omega-3 fats were not significantly linked with dementia.   7. Digestive Health  Probiotic Administration in Infants With Gastroschisis: A Pilot Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.  Gastrochisis is a serious birth defect that seems to be on the rise in the US. In children with gastrochisis, some of the intestines poke out of the body through a hole in the abdominal wall.  This randomized controlled trial in infants with gastrochisis showed that probiotic supplementation had no effects on any clinical outcomes, including the length of their hospital stay.   Effectiveness of Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus for the management of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiota, resulting in overgrowth of undesirable bacteria and diarrhea. However, evidence suggests that supplementing with probiotics may be effective at preventing these side effects.  This 10-week, randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. helveticus , one week after completing an antibiotic treatment, reduced the duration of diarrhea.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Sodium nitrate co-ingestion with protein does not augment postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates in older, type 2 diabetes patients.  In older people, dietary protein doesn’t stimulate muscle protein formation as efficiently as in young people. This has been associated with impaired delivery of protein (amino acids) to muscle cells.  Evidence suggests that dietary nitrate may help improve blood flow in muscles. However, this study in elderly people with diabetes showed that eating sodium nitrate with protein does not improve the rate of muscle protein formation.   9. Infections and Immune Health  Effect of vitamin D supplementation, directly or via breast milk for term infants, on serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D and related biochemistry, and propensity to infection: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in Indian infants examined the effectiveness of supplementing with vitamin D, 10 µg/day for 9 months, combined with 15 minutes of sun exposure every day, on levels of vitamin D and the risk of infections.  The study found that vitamin D supplementation, either direct or from the mother through breast milk, was better for maintaining normal vitamin D levels than sun exposure alone. Supplementing also reduced the risk of lung infections or diarrhea.   10. Skin Health  Consumption of dairy in teenagers with and without acne.  Acne is a skin disease characterized by greasy skin, blackheads and pimples. It is most common among teenagers. Evidence suggests that high intake of certain foods, such as dairy or sugar, may increase the risk of acne in predisposed individuals.  This observational study in 225 adolescents found that total dairy intake was not associated with acne. However, intake of low-fat milk was significantly higher among those who had acne.   11. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Intakes of Micronutrients Are Associated With Early Growth in Extremely Preterm Infants.  This observational study in extremely preterm infants showed that a low folate intake was associated with poor growth, both in weight and length. High iron intake was also linked with poor length gain and head circumference.   12. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Alcohol drinking patterns and risk of functional limitations in two cohorts of older adults.  Difficulties peforming physical or mental tasks in daily life are collectively known as functional limitations.  This observational study in older people showed that moderate alcohol intake, as well as the Mediterranean Drinking Pattern, was linked to a reduced risk of functional limitations. The causality of this association is unknown.   13. Women’s Health  Serum caffeine and paraxanthine concentrations and menstrual cycle function: correlations with beverage intakes and associations with race, reproductive hormones, and anovulation in the BioCycle Study.  Health professionals sometimes advise women to limit their caffeine intake when trying to become pregnant. However, the evidence supporting this recommendation is limited.  This study found that high circulating levels of caffeine (or its metabolite paraxanthine) were associated with reduced testosterone levels and improved menstrual cycle function in healthy women.   14. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Ultra-long-term human salt balance studies reveal interrelations between sodium, potassium, and chloride intake and excretion.  This long-term study examined the effects of salt intake on the levels of sodium in urine. It found suggests there is a high day-to-day variability in the urine levels of sodium, even when salt and potassium intake is constant.  The researchers concluded that 24-hour urine collections, commonly used to estimate sodium intake, are very inaccurate. Multiple-day collections are needed.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Can Probiotics Help Reduce Depression?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 15, 2016  Everyone feels down from time to time, and sometimes it seems to happen for no apparent reason.  Interestingly, research indicates that unexplained or persistent periods of low mood may be triggered by poor health. Some evidence even suggests that the bacteria living in your gut may be responsible.  Recently, a team of Iranian scientists examined the effects of supplementing with probiotics (healthy bacteria) on the symptoms of major depressive disorder.  Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Depression is a mental state associated with low mood, loss of interest in life, hopelessness and a variety of negative feelings.  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is when depression becomes so severe that it starts to interfere with daily activities.  Researchers have estimated that around 20% of people may experience MDD at least once during their lifetime ( 1 ).  The underlying cause of MDD is unknown, but studies indicate that persistent inflammation and oxidative stress are involved ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Some studies have even linked depression, as well other mental disorders, with gut dysbiosis , an imbalance in the gut microbiota ( 5 , 6 ).  For this reason, some researchers believe that a regular intake of probiotics might help reduce depressive symptoms. This idea is supported by a few studies showing that probiotics may have favorable effects on mood.  Here are summaries of their findings over the years:   2007: Drinking a probiotic milk beverage for 3 weeks improved mood among those who initially had the lowest mood, while it didn’t affect others ( 7 ).  2009: Taking Lactobacillus casei significantly reduced self-reported anxiety in people with chronic fatigue syndrome ( 8 ).  2011: Supplementing with a probiotic formulation for 30 days reduced self-rated anxiety and depression in healthy people and anxiety-like behavior in rats ( 9 ).  2015: Eating probiotic yogurt or taking probiotic capsules for 6 weeks improved mental health in petrochemical workers ( 10 ).   However, until now, no studies have examined the effects of probiotics on the symptoms of major depressive disorder.  Article Reviewed  This study examined the effects of supplementing with probiotics on the symptoms of depression, as well as inflammation and oxidative stress.  Clinical and metabolic response to probiotic administration in patients with major depressive disorder: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Study Design  The purpose of this 8-week randomized controlled trial was to examine the effectiveness of probiotics on treating the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD).  A total of 40 people (34 women and 6 men) with MDD were randomly assigned to receive one of two supplements:   Probiotics: The participants took one probiotic capsule daily. Each capsule provided three types of probiotics: Lactobacillus acidophilus , L. casei and Bifidobacterium bifidum (6 billion CFU in total).  Placebo: The participants took one starch capsule daily.   At the beginning and end of the study, the researchers measured the following:   Depressive symptoms: Symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory, a 21-question self-assessment of depressive symptoms.  Inflammation: Inflammation was estimated by measuring high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in blood samples taken after a 12-hour fast.  Insulin resistance: The sensitivity or resistance of cells to insulin was measured using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index.  Glutathione: Antioxidant status was assessed by measuring glutathione, one of the body’s primary antioxidants.   Additionally, the participants filled out three dietary records (two week days and one weekend day).  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of probiotics on depressive symptoms, inflammation, insulin resistance and antioxidant status in people with major depressive disorder.  Finding 1: Probiotics Improved Depressive Symptoms  Taking probiotics significantly improved depressive symptoms, evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory.  These findings are presented in the following chart:   This is the first study to examine the effects of probiotics on symptoms in people with major depressive disorder.  However, several previous studies support the current findings, showing that probiotics may improve mood (see background chapter).  Bottom Line: Supplementing with probiotics caused a significant improvement in depressive symptoms.  Finding 2: Probiotics Reduced Inflammation  Taking multi-strain probiotics for 8 weeks significantly reduced C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, as shown in the following chart.   These findings are supported by previous studies showing that probiotics may reduce CRP levels in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes, obese individuals and people with rheumatoid arthritis ( 11 , 12 , 13 ).  However, the present study is the first to report that probiotics reduce a marker of inflammation in people with major depressive disorder.  Bottom Line: Probiotic supplementation significantly improved C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation.  Finding 3: Probiotics Improved Insulin Sensitivity  Supplementing with probiotics for 8 weeks significantly improved insulin sensitivity and lowered insulin levels.   In contrast, changes in fasting blood sugar did not differ between groups. Also, probiotics did not significantly affect insulin sensitivity when using the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index.  As far as we know, no previous studies have examined the effects of probiotics on blood sugar and insulin sensitivity in people with major depressive disorder.  However, studies in people with type 2 diabetes support the present findings, suggesting that probiotics may improve blood sugar control. This is discussed in our previous research review .  Bottom Line: Taking probiotics for 8 weeks caused an improvement in insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin levels.  Finding 4: Probiotics Increased Glutathione Levels  Probiotic supplementation caused a slight increase in glutathione levels (a good effect), as shown below. In comparison, glutathione levels decreased significantly in the placebo group.   No changes were seen in total antioxidant capacity.  Low glutathione levels have previously been associated with major depressive disorder ( 14 ).  The effects of probiotics on glutathione levels in people with major depressive disorder have not been examined before.  However, the findings are supported by studies on other groups. For example, taking probiotics for 8 weeks reduced glutathione levels in people with type 2 diabetes ( 15 , 16 ).  Bottom Line: Probiotics improved levels of total glutathione, the body’s main antioxidant.  Limitations  There are a few limitations to the interpretation of the findings.  First, since the supplement contained three types of probiotics, we do not know which of them is responsible for the benefits.  Second, it is unknown whether taking probiotics is of any use for those on an anti-depressive medication.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that supplementing with probiotics may improve depressive symptoms in people with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Although this is the first study to examine the effects of probiotics in people with MDD, previous studies suggest that probiotics may improve mood in other groups.  Regardless of whether you are depressed or not, taking probiotics appears to be an excellent way to improve many aspects of health.

	Can the Menstralean Diet Help You Lose Weight?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 13, 2016  The Menstralean diet is a cutting edge weight loss strategy for women.  Basically, it’s synchronized with the phases of the menstrual cycle, and scientists believe that it may be easier to adhere to than the traditional approach.  Recently, a team of researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the Menstralean diet with a conventional weight loss diet.  Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  In women of reproductive age, the menstrual cycle is a recurring monthly process that prepares the body for possible pregnancy.  On average, the length of the menstrual cycle is 28 days and can be divided into three phases:   Menstruation (days 1–4).  Follicular phase (days 5–15).  Luteal phase (days 16–28).   The menstrual cycle is characterized by metabolic changes and fluctuations in hormones. Compared to menstruation and the follicular phase, the luteal phase is associated with the following:   More frequent food cravings , especially for carbs and fat ( 1 , 2 ).  Increased calorie intake ( 3 ).  Increased calorie expenditure ( 4 ).   Simply put, women tend to have a greater appetite during the luteal phase, which can promote weight gain. During this phase, it may also be harder to stick to a calorie-reduced diet.  The Menstralean weight loss program is adjusted to the different phases of the menstrual cycle. Some researchers believe that this makes it easier to follow in the long-term, compared to conventional, calorie-reduced diets.  Article Reviewed  A team of Danish researchers examined the effectiveness of the Menstralean diet and exercise program on weight loss in women.  A weight-loss program adapted to the menstrual cycle increases weight loss in healthy, overweight, premenopausal women: a 6-mo randomized controlled trial.  Study Design  The purpose of this 6-month, randomized controlled trial was to examine the effectiveness of a weight loss program designed to moderate the effects of the menstrual cycle.  A total of 31 healthy but overweight, premenopausal women completed the study. None of them were taking hormonal contraceptives.  Each of the women followed an exercise program and calorie-reduced diet that provided 1,600 kcal per day.  They were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Menstralean diet: This diet was tailored to the metabolic changes that occur during the menstrual cycle. It changed depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle (see chart below).  Control diet: This was a simple, calorie-reduced diet that contained 45–50% of calories from carbs, 15–20% from protein and 30% from fat.   All women in the Menstralean diet group started the program on the first day of their menstrual cycle.  The Menstralean diet was a 28-day plan designed to match the three phases of the menstrual cycle. Specifically, the proportion of protein, fat and carbs differed depending on the phase, as shown in the chart below:   The luteal phase (phase 3) is associated with more frequent food cravings and increased calorie intake ( 3 ).  For this reason, the participants were allowed to eat an additional 200 kcal of dark chocolate per day during phase 3.  What’s more, the diet in phases 2 and 3 provided higher amounts of protein (30% of total calories) in hopes that it would reduce appetite and cravings, making the program easier to follow.  All of the participants were also advised to exercise. On the Menstralean diet, the exercise routine changed depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle:   Phase 1 (days 1-5): Light training once a day. This involved walking, yoga or stretching.  Phase 2 (days 6-14): Circuit training consisting of weight and aerobic exercises 2 days a week and cardio 2–3 days a week.  Phase 3 (days 15-28): Weight training 2 days a week and cardio 2–3 days a week.  Control (days 1-28): Vigorous exercise for half an hour 2 days of the week but moderate exercise on the other 5 days. This exercise program corresponded to Danish public health guidelines.   At the start, midpoint and end of the study, the researchers measured body weight and waist circumference.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of the Menstralean diet, a weight loss program that’s synchronized with the menstrual cycle.  Finding: The Menstralean Weight Loss Program Caused Greater Weight Loss  Weight loss was similar in both groups when average values were compared.  However, when participants who didn’t fully comply with the program were excluded from the calculations, those in the Menstralean group turned out to have lost significantly more weight, compared to the control group.  These findings are shown in the chart below:   Simply put, those who followed the Menstralean weight loss program lost an additional 10 pounds (5 kg) over a 6-month period, compared to the control group.  Waist circumference also decreased by additional 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) in the Menstralean group, compared to the control group.  The protein content of the Menstralean diet was higher than the control group’s. Specifically, protein provided 30% of the total calories most days on the Menstralean diet but only 15–20% on the control diet.  Eating more protein is an effective weight loss strategy and may have been responsible for at least some of the differences between groups ( 5 , 6 ).  This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of a weight loss program that is synchronized with the menstrual cycle. Further studies need to confirm its findings.  Bottom Line: Those participants who managed to follow the Menstralean weight loss program lost significantly more weight than those in the control group.  Limitations  This study had several limitations.  First, it was not possible to blind the participants to their treatment. Those in the Menstralean group may have realized that they had been assigned to a new and unusual weight loss program.  As a result, they may have become more motivated than those in the control group.  Accordingly, the drop-out rate was much higher in the control group (61%) than the Menstralean group (38%).  Second, the drop-out rate was quite high, suggesting that the weight loss program may have been hard to follow and not for everyone.  Third, the Menstralean diet may not be relevant for women taking hormonal contraceptives.  Finally, the menstrual cycle is highly variable between women. Accurately synchronizing a weight loss program with the menstrual cycle may be difficult.  Bottom Line: The study’s main limitations were a high drop-out rate and indications of lower motivation in the control group.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study suggests that synchronizing a weight loss program with the phases of the menstrual cycle makes it easier to follow. This approach was called the Menstralean diet.  However, the study had several limitations that make the findings difficult to interpret.  First, the Menstralean diet provided higher amounts of protein, compared to the control group.  Second, differences in drop-out rates suggest that participants on the control diet may have been less motivated. Of course, this also supports the idea that the Menstralean diet is easier to stick to, but we do not know for sure.  Simply put, it’s debatable whether matching a diet to the phases of the menstrual cycle is more effective than a traditional approach. Further studies need to confirm the findings.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (June 3rd–10th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 10, 2016  This is our weekly selection of recently published nutrition research.  Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Regional light pollution is associated with higher obesity rates.  Older people’s protein requirements may be underestimated.  Aspartame is associated with impaired blood sugar control in obese individuals.  Too much sodium may increase the risk of heart disease in people with high blood pressure.  Textured foods reduce appetite more than simple-textured foods.  Caffeine temporarily helps you get things done and achieve your goals.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed one study examining the association of outdoor light pollution with regional obesity rates and another assessing the protein requirements of older people using a new technique.   Review:  Does Night-Time Light Make People Fat?  Article:  Does artificial light-at-night exposure contribute to the worldwide obesity pandemic?  Summary: This was an observational study examining the association of outdoor, artificial light levels with obesity rates.  The study found that higher regional light levels were linked with increased obesity rates. The causality of this association is unknown. The authors speculated that light might promote weight gain by impairing people’s sleep and disrupting the body clock.   Review:  Do Recommendations Underestimate People’s Protein Requirements?  Article:  Dietary Protein Requirement of Men >65 Years Old Determined by the Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation Technique Is Higher than the Current Estimated Average Requirement.  Summary: This study evaluated the protein requirements of older people using a new and potentially more accurate technique.  It suggests that the official recommendations for protein intake may underestimate protein requirements by 30%. However, further studies are needed before the current recommendations can be changed.   New Research from Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Pregnancy and Infant Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Vitamin D and body composition in the elderly.  This observational study in elderly people showed that low circulating levels of vitamin D were associated with a greater fat mass. However, the causality of this association is unknown.  It is unlikely that vitamin D deficiency causes obesity. Instead, higher amounts of fat mass may bind to vitamin D, reducing its blood levels. Further studies are needed.   Efficacy of an orlistat-resveratrol combination for weight loss in subjects with obesity: A randomized controlled trial.  This 6-month, randomized controlled trial in obese adults on a calorie-reduced diet showed that supplementing with a combination of resveratrol and orlistat caused significantly more weight loss than orlistat or resveratrol alone.  Resveratrol is an antioxidant found in plant foods, such as the skin of red grapes and blueberries, whereas orlistat is a pharmaceutical weight loss drug that blocks the absorption of dietary fat.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effects of wheat bran extract rich in arabinoxylan oligosaccharides and resistant starch on overnight glucose tolerance and markers of gut fermentation in healthy young adults.  Arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOs) are a type of prebiotic fiber found in wheat bran.  This randomized crossover study in healthy adults showed that eating bread enriched with AXOs in the evening improved insulin sensitivity in the morning.   Aspartame intake is associated with greater glucose intolerance in individuals with obesity.  Aspartame is a common artificial sweetener. This observational study showed that a higher intake of aspartame was associated with impaired obesity-related blood sugar control. The causality of this association is unclear.   3. Heart Health  Associations of urinary sodium excretion with cardiovascular events in individuals with and without hypertension: a pooled analysis of data from four studies.  This large observational study showed that a higher sodium intake was linked with increased systolic blood pressure and an increased risk of heart disease events and death in people with high blood pressure (hypertension).  However, a similar association was not seen in people without hypertension. Additionally, low sodium intakes were linked with an increased risk of heart disease events and death, regardless of people’s blood pressure.   Potassium supplementation and heart rate: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that supplementing with 2–3 grams of potassium per day is unlikely to increase heart rate in healthy adults.  In contrast, previous studies have indicated that increased potassium intake may lower blood pressure.   Soy milk powder supplemented with phytosterol esters reduced serum cholesterol level in hypercholesterolemia independently of lipoprotein E genotype: A random clinical placebo-controlled trial.  Phytosterols are a group of plant compounds found in oils and fat. They have a structure similar to cholesterol.  This randomized controlled trial in older Chinese people found that supplementing with 2 grams of phytosterols per day for 6 months reduced circulating levels of cholesterol by 9.3%. However, the health benefits are debatable.   Impact of flavonoid-rich black tea and beetroot juice on postprandial peripheral vascular resistance and glucose homeostasis in obese, insulin-resistant men: a randomized controlled trial.  Vascular resistance (VR) is the force needed to keep the blood flowing through your veins. It mainly depends on how narrow or dilated your veins are. High VR is an aspect of high blood pressure.  This randomized controlled trial in obese, insulin-resistant men found that drinking 100 ml of black tea or beetroot juice, combined with 75 grams of glucose, reduced VR, compared to a placebo. The tea also decreased their rise in insulin.   Impact of menaquinone-4 supplementation on coronary artery calcification and arterial stiffness: an open label single arm study.  Arterial stiffness is a measure of the blood vessels’ ability to expand or contract. It specifically refers to the arteries, the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart. Increased arterial stiffness is associated with an elevated risk of heart disease.  This study showed that supplementing with 45 mg of menaquinone-4 (vitamin K2) per day for 1 year did not affect arterial stiffness.   Dairy Consumption and Risk of Stroke: A Systematic Review and Updated Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that drinking milk and eating cheese may reduce the risk of stroke. However, total intake of dairy products, yogurt or butter was not significantly linked with the risk of stroke.   4. Cancer  The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index Predicts Survival in Elderly Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients with Radiotherapy.  Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a type of cancer that forms in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.  This observational study showed that a favorable score on the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index was associated with better treatment outcomes in older people undergoing radiotherapy to treat ESCC.   5. Appetite and Eating  Satiety effects of psyllium in healthy volunteers.  Psyllium husk is a type of fiber commonly used to treat constipation and the main active component in Metamucil. Like other bulk-producing types of fiber, it may be used to promote fullness.  This randomized controlled trial found that 3.4–10.2 grams of psyllium taken before meals significantly reduced hunger and the desire to eat and increased fullness. These findings suggest that psyllium may be effective at reducing calorie intake.   Increased textural complexity in food enhances satiation.  This randomized crossover trial showed that eating food with complex textures reduced appetite and calorie intake, compared to foods with simple textures.  This is likely due to the fact that people tend to spend more time chewing textured food, which promotes a decrease in appetite.   Pleasure as an ally of healthy eating? Contrasting visceral and Epicurean eating pleasure and their association with portion size preferences and wellbeing.  There are two distinct types of eating-related pleasures. One is visceral eating pleasure (VEP), which is triggered by hunger, smell, cravings or other emotional urges. Too much VEP is linked to overeating and weight gain.  The other is Epicurean eating pleasure (EEP), which is the appreciation of the cultural, aesthetic or symbolic value of food. Unlike VEP, EEP is associated with health and smaller food portions and not linked with a higher body mass index.   Calorie Underestimation When Buying High-Calorie Beverages in Fast-Food Contexts.  This study asked 1,877 adults and 1,178 adolescents visiting fast food restaurants to estimate the calories in the food they ordered. It showed that people significantly underestimated the calorie content of their food.  This especially applied to high-calorie beverages. The findings indicate that high-calorie beverages, such as sugar-sweetened soft drinks, significantly contribute to calorie underestimation and overeating.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Milk intake during pregnancy is inversely associated with the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms in Japan: The Kyushu Okinawa Maternal and Child Health Study.  Postpartum depression affects some women in the first few months after childbirth. This observational study in Japanese women suggests that drinking milk during pregnancy is linked with a lower risk of postpartum depression.   Investigating the effects of caffeine on executive functions using traditional Stroop and a new ecologically-valid virtual reality task, the Jansari assessment of Executive Functions (JEF©).  Executive function is a term used to describe the mental skills that help you achieve your goals. These include attention, working memory, reasoning and problem solving, to name a few.  This study suggests that caffeine, the stimulant found in coffee, may improve many aspects of executive function, such as planning, creative thinking and reaction time.   From gut dysbiosis to altered brain function and mental illness: mechanisms and pathways.  Gut dysbiosis is when there is an unhealthy imbalance in the bacterial community of the digestive system. This review discusses how dysbiosis may possibly affect brain function, causing depression and other psychiatric disorders.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Anabolic effects of leucine-rich whey protein, carbohydrate, and soy protein with and without β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) during fasting-induced catabolism: A human randomized crossover trial.  β-hydroxy-β–methylbutyrate (HMB) is a common supplement used to increase muscle strength and performance and reduce recovery time after training. It is also formed in the body as a metabolite of leucine, an essential amino acid.  This randomized controlled trial found that supplementing with a leucine-rich whey protein beverage or soy protein enriched with 3 grams of HMB improved muscle maintenance after 36 hours of fasting, compared to carbs or soy protein alone.   8. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage.  This Cochrane review concluded that supplementing with vitamins before pregnancy or during early pregnancy does not prevent miscarriage. However, taking multivitamins along with iron and folic acid may reduce the risk of stillbirth.   Decreased serum vitamin D levels in early spontaneous pregnancy loss.  This observational study showed that a vitamin D deficiency was associated with pregnancy loss (miscarriage) in the first trimester of pregnancy.   Association between lutein intake and lutein concentrations in human milk samples from lactating mothers in South Korea.  Lutein is an antioxidant found in high amounts in many vegetables, such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, watercress, romaine lettuce, zucchini and Brussels sprouts.  This observational study in lactating South Korean mothers showed that a high intake of lutein-rich foods was linked with increased lutein levels in breast milk, suggesting that it may also benefit the infant.

	Do Recommendations Underestimate People’s Protein Requirements?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 8, 2016  The methods used to assess people’s nutrient requirements are not perfect, and newer and potentially better techniques may change recommendations over time.  For example, new techniques suggest that official recommendations for protein intake may be too low, especially for older people.  Recently, a team of researchers evaluated the protein requirements for older men using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique.  Today’s review provides a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Older adults arguably require greater amounts of protein than younger people.  They have reduced rates of protein synthesis, and higher amounts of dietary protein are required to fully stimulate muscle maintenance and growth ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Yet, the current dietary reference intake (DRI) and WHO recommendations are the same for young and old people.  Currently, they are the following:   Estimated average requirement (EAR): 0.66 grams per kilogram (0.3 grams per pound) of body weight per day. The EAR refers to the intake level estimated to fulfill the requirements of half of the healthy individuals in the specified group.  Recommended daily allowance (RDA): 0.8 grams per kilogram (0.36 grams per pound) of body weight per day. The RDA refers to the intake level estimated to fulfill the requirements of 97% of healthy individuals.   These recommendations are based on nitrogen balance studies, which have several limitations ( 5 , 6 ).  However, newer studies in older women have used the IAAO technique, which is newer and possibly more accurate ( 7 ).  They suggest that the recommended values may be too low for older people ( 8 , 9 ).  Additionally, studies in older people with protein intakes equal to the current RDA suggest that they may lead to loss of muscle mass ( 10 ).  One working group even proposed that the recommendations for older people should be raised to 1.2–1.5 grams per kilogram (0.55–0.68 grams per pound) of body weight per day ( 11 ).  However, the evidence is limited and, until now, no studies have estimated the protein requirements of older men using the IAAO technique.  Article Reviewed  This study assessed the protein requirements of older men using the IAAO technique.  Dietary Protein Requirement of Men >65 Years Old Determined by the Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation Technique Is Higher than the Current Estimated Average Requirement.   Study Design  The purpose of this randomized, crossover trial was to assess the dietary protein requirements of six men, aged 65 or older, using the IAAO technique.  Additionally, the researchers compared the values obtained in the present study with those of older women and young men, as previously determined using the same technique ( 8 , 12 ).  The participants received a total of seven different amounts of protein in a random order in different study periods, separated by one or two weeks.  The amounts of protein tested ranged from 0.2–2.0 grams for each kilogram (0.1–0.9 grams per pound) of body weight per day.  Each level of protein intake was tested over a 3-day period, starting with two adaptation days. On day three, protein requirements were assessed using the IAAO technique ( 13 ).  On the adaptation days, the participants received a weight-maintenance diet based on a lactose-free milkshake that provided 1 gram of protein per kilogram (0.45 grams per pound) of body weight per day.  On the third day, the participants arrived at the research center after a 12-hour fast. They then consumed eight hourly meals, each of which represented 1/12th of their daily calorie requirements.  The test day diet consisted of a protein-free liquid formula, protein-free cookies, grape seed oil and an amino acid mixture resembling the composition of egg protein.  Depending on the amount of protein being tested, the test meal provided 40% of calories from fat, 37–57% from carbs and 3–37% from protein. The diet provided 1.5 times the calories required for weight maintenance at rest.  Bottom Line: The purpose of this study was to assess the protein requirements of older men using the IAAO technique and compare the findings with previous studies using the same technique.  Finding 1: Protein Requirements of Older Men Are Higher Than Recommendations  The study showed that both the EAR and RDA for protein were higher than official recommendations.   EAR: 0.94 grams per kilogram (0.43 grams per pound) of body weight per day.  RDA: 1.24 grams per kilogram (0.56 grams per pound) of body weight per day.   These values are similar to what the same research team has found in older women using the same method ( 8 , 12 ).  The chart below compares the current findings with the official recommendations:   Simply put, the current EAR and RDA for older people may be underestimated by 30%.  However, before any strong conclusions can be reached, larger studies need to confirm the findings.  Bottom Line: This study suggests that the current recommended protein intake for older people may be underestimated by around 30%.  Finding 2: Protein Requirements May Increase with Age  The researchers compared the findings of the current study with previous studies in young men and older women using the same technique ( 8 , 12 ).  The chart below shows the comparison of the EAR for protein between groups. Protein requirements are either expressed for each kilogram of body weight per day (BW) or for each kilogram of lean body mass per day (LBM).   The protein requirements for each kilogram of body weight were equal between all three groups. However, on the basis of lean body mass, they were higher in older men and women, compared to young men.  Bottom Line: Based on lean body mass, the protein requirements of older people were higher, compared to young people.  What Are the Health Effects of Inadequate Protein Intake?  Eating inadequate amounts of protein has adverse health effects, especially in older people.  These include the following:   Muscle loss (sarcopenia) ( 14 , 15 ).  Decreased muscle strength and function ( 16 , 17 ).  Bone loss and an increased risk of fractures ( 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ).  Reduced immune response , increasing the risk of infections ( 22 ).   Accordingly, one observational study showed that higher protein intakes were associated with fewer health problems in older people ( 23 ).  Bottom Line: Inadequate protein intake may promote muscle and bone loss and reduced strength. Additionally, it may impair the body’s immune response to infections.  Limitations  This study had an excellent design, but one of its main limitations was the low number of participants.  Also, since the study used a marker of protein requirements, the true relevance of the findings need to be tested in long-term trials. However, conducting such trials may be difficult.  Finally, the body may be able to adjust to low protein intakes, but this study did not take such adaptations into account ( 24 ).  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study suggests that the current recommendations for protein intake among older men is underestimated by around 30%.  However, before the recommendations can be changed, the findings need to be validated by further studies.  Tags: Macronutrients , Men's health , Protein

	Does Night-Time Light Make People Fat?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 6, 2016  A large number of things contribute to weight gain.  Some scientists even believe that night-time light, as insignificant as it may seem, could contribute to obesity over time.  Recently, an observational study examined the association of artificial, night-time light with obesity rates.  Today’s review provides a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  Living in an urban area is associated with many risk factors for weight gain and obesity. One of them is artificial light-at-night (ALAN).  ALAN comes from a variety of sources, including highways, railways, street lights, buildings, industries and billboards.  The reason why ALAN may contribute to obesity is not entirely clear, but scientists believe that a disrupted body clock and reduced formation of night-time melatonin are involved ( 1 , 2 ).  Previous studies also show that ALAN exposure may increase weight in laboratory animals ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ).  This is supported by two observational studies suggesting that increased light intensity in people’s bedrooms at night time may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity ( 7 , 8 ).  However, until now, no studies have examined the association of ALAN with obesity rates on a population level.  Article Reviewed  This study examined the association of artificial, night-time light intensity with obesity rates.  Does artificial light-at-night exposure contribute to the worldwide obesity pandemic?  Study Design  This observational study examined the association of obesity rates with artificial, outdoor, night-time light pollution.  Night-time illumination in residential areas was assessed using recent satellite images from more than 80 countries.  Information on obesity rates was obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) country-wide database.  When calculating the associations, the researchers statistically adjusted for potential bias by taking the following into account: population wealth (per capita GDP), level of urbanization, birth rate, food consumption and regional differences.  Bottom Line: This observational study examined the association of obesity rates with illumination at night.  Finding: Artificial, Night-Time Light Was Linked With Higher Obesity Rates  On a regional level, greater artificial, night-time light intensity was linked with higher obesity rates in more than 80 countries throughout the world.  Specifically, night-time illumination explained 72â73% of the regional differences in overweight and obesity rates in women and 67â68% in men.  Additionally, the researchers found that when artificial light-at-night levels increased from the minimum amount to the maximum, obesity rates appeared to increase, on average, by about 900% in Asia and 250% in the rest of the world.  Bottom Line: On a regional level, greater light pollution was associated with higher obesity rates.  How Can Night-Time Light Increase Weight Gain?  It is not entirely clear how increased artificial light-at-night might contribute to weight gain and obesity.  However, scientists have come up with several plausible theories:   Disrupted sleep quality: Night-time light exposure reduces sleep quality and may disrupt the body clock, potentially contributing to weight gain ( 9 , 10 ).  Increased appetite: Poor sleep and irregular sleeping patterns may disrupt the 24-hour fluctuations of appetite hormones ( 11 ).  Reduced calorie expenditure: Conversion of brown fat tissue into white fat tissue may slow down metabolic rate and calorie expenditure ( 12 ).   In a previous research review , we discussed the possible ways in which a disrupted body clock may affect weight gain and obesity.  Bottom Line: Being exposed to light while sleeping can reduce sleep quality. This may disrupt the body clock, potentially increasing appetite or reducing calorie expenditure.  Does Night-Time Light Really Make People Obese?  A variety of things contribute to weight gain and obesity.  On its own, it’s unlikely that night-time light exposure causes obesity, but when combined with other obesogenic factors it might increase the risk.  Other factors associated with an urban environment have also been linked with an increased risk of obesity. These include:   Traffic noise ( 13 , 14 , 15 ).  Traffic-related air pollution ( 16 , 17 ).  Increased fast food accessibility ( 18 ).   However, since most of the evidence is observational, it is difficult to isolate individual factors.  Although the human evidence is limited, controlled animal studies support the idea that night-time light may affect weight gain ( 3 , 5 ).  Bottom Line: It is unlikely that artificial light-at-night has a large impact on obesity on its own. However, it might contribute to obesity when combined with other risk factors.  Limitations  The study’s main limitation was its observational design.  Simply put, it couldn’t prove that light exposure at night caused weight gain and obesity. Living in urban areas is associated with many other factors that may promote obesity.  Additionally, this was a population-level study, examining large populations of people rather than individuals.  Second, certain types of light are worse than others. For example, blue light suppresses melatonin formation more than other types of light. Distinguishing between different types of light could provide more accurate results ( 19 ).  Bottom Line: This was an observational study. For this reason, it doesn’t prove that night-time light exposure causes obesity.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study suggests that increased night-time light pollution in people’s bedrooms may increase the risk of obesity.  Night-time light is thought to disrupt the body clock, causing a hormonal imbalance that may affect appetite and/or calorie expenditure.  Due to its observational design, the study doesn’t provide any proof, but the findings are supported by controlled studies in animals.  Regardless of its possible effects on weight gain, a poor night’s sleep is unhealthy. Making sure your bedroom is dark at night may be something to consider.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (May 27th–June 3rd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 3, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, May 27th, to Friday, June 3rd, 2016.  Here are some of the most interesting findings this week:   Some people are more prone to weight gain than others.  Metabolic syndrome reduces vitamin E bioavailability.  The content of your breakfast is important.  Eating breakfast may have short-term cognitive benefits.  Flavonoid antioxidants may help prevent infections.  Causes of folate deficiency during pregnancy.  Risk factors for malnutrition in older adults.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two papers: one examining the link between starvation response (thriftiness) and obesity and the other looking at vitamin E bioavailability among people with metabolic syndrome.   Review:  Thriftiness: Another Piece of the Obesity Puzzle.  Article:  Lower core body temperature and greater body fat are components of a human thrifty phenotype.  Summary: This study showed that some people are better at conserving calories during periods of fasting (or starvation).  Not only does this make them more likely to survive a famine, it also makes them prone to gaining fat when food is abundant.   Review:  The Bioavailability of Vitamin E is Lower in Metabolic Syndrome.  Article:  α-Tocopherol bioavailability is lower in adults with metabolic syndrome regardless of dairy fat co-ingestion: a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.  Summary: This randomized, crossover trial examined the bioavailability of vitamin E among people with metabolic syndrome.  Metabolic syndrome reduces vitamin E bioavailability, but the underlying cause is not entirely clear. Increased oxidative stress or inflammation may play a role.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Infections and Immune Health  Skin Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Combination of soya protein and polydextrose reduces energy intake and glycaemic response via modulation of gastric emptying rate, ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 in Chinese.  Polydextrose (PD) is a type of soluble fiber commonly used in processed food to replace sugar, increase its fiber content and reduce its calorie content.  This controlled trial in Chinese men showed that eating high-protein soybean curd, with or without PD, and low-protein soybean curd, with PD, reduced calorie intake at a later meal, compared to the low-protein curd alone.   Energy Contribution and Nutrient Composition of Breakfast and Their Relations to Overweight in Free-living Individuals: A Systematic Review.  This review looked at the evidence linking breakfast consumption with obesity, while focusing on the nutritional composition of breakfast.  It found that based on observational data, no strong conclusions can be made about the importance of breakfast for preventing obesity.   Evaluating the Intervention-Based Evidence Surrounding the Causal Role of Breakfast on Markers of Weight Management, with Specific Focus on Breakfast Composition and Size.  This scientific review discussed the evidence linking breakfast with a healthy body weight, focusing on intervention studies. Overall, the evidence is mixed and weak.  However, growing evidence suggests that a breakfast high in fiber and protein may improve body weight more than other breakfasts. Additionally, it may be better if most of the daily calories are consumed early in the day.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effect of fat type in baked bread on amylose–lipid complex formation and glycaemic response.  The interaction of carbs (starch) and fat in bread may form so-called amylose-lipid complexes (ALC). These complexes have been associated with reduced digestibility of starch. They may also improve its glycemic index.  This study showed that adding fat to a bread recipe significantly increased the amount of ALC and reduced the rise in blood sugar after eating the bread. Coconut or olive oil led to higher amounts of ALC, compared to butter or grapeseed oil.   The Effects of Breakfast Consumption and Composition on Metabolic Wellness with a Focus on Carbohydrate Metabolism.  This review of randomized controlled trials suggests that eating breakfast may improve blood sugar control throughout the day. This especially applies to low-glycemic breakfasts that are high in fiber and/or protein.   Greater diet quality is associated with more optimal glycemic control in a longitudinal study of youth with type 1 diabetes.  This observational study showed that a higher dietary quality, evaluated using the Healthy Eating Index 2005, was linked with an improved blood sugar control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.  Specifically, high intake of whole plant foods, fiber, carbs, low-glycemic foods and unsaturated fat were associated with lower blood sugar levels.   3. Heart Health  Polyunsaturated fats, carbohydrates and carotid disease: The Atherosclerosis Risk in communities (ARIC) carotid MRI study.  Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries, the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart. It is characterized by fat accumulation (plaque buildup) on their inner surface, and they may eventually become clogged.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of polyunsaturated fat and a low-glycemic diet does not reduce the risk of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques.   4. Cancer  Vitamin C supplement intake and postmenopausal breast cancer risk: interaction with dietary vitamin C.  This observational study showed that a high vitamin C intake from foods (but not supplements) was linked with a higher risk of developing breast cancer.   5. Brain and Mental Health  The Effects of Breakfast and Breakfast Composition on Cognition in Adults.  This scientific review examined the available evidence linking breakfast consumption with mental performance or cognition in adults. The reviewers broadly defined breakfast as a meal after a fasting period of 8 hours or longer.  Overall, the evidence suggests that eating breakfast may slightly improve memory and attention in healthy adults in the short-term.   The Effects of Breakfast and Breakfast Composition on Cognition in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review.  Breakfast is believed to positively affect cognition and school performance among children. Yet it’s the most frequently skipped meal, especially among adolescents.  This systematic review looked at the evidence linking breakfast with mental performance among children and adolescents. Overall, the results suggest that eating breakfast may have short-term benefits for cognition, compared to fasting.   6. Digestive Health  Prechewing infant food, consumption of sweets and dairy and not breastfeeding are associated with increased diarrhoea risk of 10-month-old infants in the United States.  Parents or caregivers sometimes pre-chew food for infants. In the US, this practice is most common among African-Americans and Alaska Natives.  This observational study in 10-month old infants showed that those who ate pre-chewed food were at a higher risk of diarrhea. Other factors linked with a higher diarrhea risk included eating lots of sweets and dairy. Breastfeeding reduced the risk.   7. Liver Health  Healthy dietary pattern is inversely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in elderly.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis.  Older age is a risk factor for NAFLD. This observational study in elderly people showed that a healthy dietary pattern was associated with a lower risk of NAFLD.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Serum betaine is inversely associated with low lean mass mainly in men in a Chinese middle-aged and elderly community-dwelling population.  Previous studies suggest that supplementing with betaine (trimethylglycine) may increase muscle mass in livestock and improve muscle performance in humans. However, it is unclear if betaine has any effects on muscle mass in humans.  This observational study linked higher circulating levels of betaine to a higher lean body mass in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults, especially men.   9. Infections and Immune Health  Effect of Flavonoids on Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Immune Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Flavonoids are a subcategory of polyphenol antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables and other plant foods.  This systematic review of randomized controlled trials in healthy adults found that supplementing with flavonoids reduced the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections by 33%, compared to a placebo.   10. Skin Health  Vitamin D treatment for connective tissue diseases: hope beyond the hype?  Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are a category of health disorders that affect the skin, bones and joints. Previous studies show that vitamin D deficiency is common among people with CTDs.  This review discussed the potential effectiveness of vitamin D supplements in the treatment of CTDs. However, the authors concluded that the evidence is limited and further high-quality trials are needed before any solid conclusions can be reached.   11. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Predictors of folate status among pregnant Japanese women: the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children’s Health, 2002–2012.  Spina bifida is a birth defect associated with folate deficiency during pregnancy. It is becoming more common in Japan. This observational study examined the determinants of folate status in pregnant Japanese women during the first trimester.  Four factors were identified as a significant cause of poor folate status: young age, low educational level, low annual income and smoking. In contrast, supplementing with folic acid was the strongest predictor of good folate status.   12. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Risk Factors for Malnutrition in Older Adults: A Systematic Review of the Literature Based on Longitudinal Data.  This systematic review of observational studies examined the risk factors for malnutrition in adults, aged 65 and older. 6 studies were included in the analyses.  The following risk factors have been identified: old age, institutionalization, use of 4 or more medications, general health decline, decline in physical function, constipation, cognitive decline, depression and poor appetite, to name a few.   Consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of frailty: a dose-response analysis of 3 prospective cohorts of community-dwelling older adults.  This prospective observational study in older, community-dwelling adults showed that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk of frailty.  The association may be caused by other healthy lifestyle factors linked with fruit and vegetable consumption. For example, those who consumed the lowest amounts also had the lowest physical activity levels.   13. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Comparison of polyphenol intakes according to distinct dietary patterns and food sources in the Adventist Health Study-2 cohort.  Polyphenols are a large category of antioxidants found in plants. They have been associated with a variety of health benefits. This observational study found that the main foods contributing to people’s polyphenol intake were coffee and fruits.  Subgroups of polyphenols also differed between dietary patterns, with flavonoid intake highest among pesco-vegetarians and phenolic acid intake (mainly from coffee) highest among non-vegetarians.

	The Bioavailability of Vitamin E is Lower in Metabolic Syndrome  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  June 1, 2016  Metabolic syndrome affects 34.7% of Americans ( 1 ).  It is a collective term for several adverse health conditions commonly associated with abdominal obesity.  Studies suggest that people with metabolic syndrome have lower levels of antioxidants, such as vitamin E, but the reason is not entirely clear.  A recent study examined vitamin E bioavailability in people with metabolic syndrome.  Today’s review provides a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  Vitamin E is a group of fat-soluble antioxidants, also known as tocopherols and tocotrienols.  Only one of them — alpha-tocopherol — is thought to meet the body’s vitamin E requirements. In this review, alpha-tocopherol will simply be referred to as vitamin E.  Like other fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin E is believed to be better absorbed into the bloodstream when eaten with fat ( 2 ).  In the body, its strong antioxidant properties protect cell membranes from oxidative damage.  For this reason, the elevated oxidative stress and inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome may increase people’s vitamin E requirements ( 3 , 4 ).  Vitamin E levels are generally lower in people with metabolic syndrome, compared to healthy individuals ( 5 ).  Oxidative stress and inflammation are believed to explain these low levels, but it’s unclear how metabolic syndrome affects vitamin E bioavailability or the proportion of active vitamin E entering the blood circulation.  Article Reviewed  This study examined the effects of metabolic syndrome and dairy fat on vitamin E bioavailability.  α-Tocopherol bioavailability is lower in adults with metabolic syndrome regardless of dairy fat co-ingestion: a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.  Study Design  The purpose of this randomized, crossover trial was to examine vitamin E bioavailability in people with metabolic syndrome, compared to healthy people. It also examined whether dairy fat had any effects on its absorption.  A total of 20 men and women were recruited — 10 with metabolic syndrome and 10 healthy individuals. These two groups were age-matched and contained an equal number of men and women.  All participants received 15 mg of vitamin E on 4 separate study visits, each of which was separated by a 2-week washout period.  On each visit, the participants arrived at the research unit in the morning after an overnight fast and took the vitamin E supplement with 240 ml of milk.  The fat content of the milk differed between visits, and on one occasion they got soy milk instead of cow’s milk, as shown in the chart below.   All of the participants were provided with standardized food three days prior to, as well as during the first 24 hours of, each study visit.  Throughout each study visit, which lasted for 72 hours, the researchers collected blood at regular intervals. They then measured various blood variables, including vitamin E and C, blood lipids and inflammatory markers.  Researchers also conducted a test-tube experiment, examining the effect of dairy fat on the potential absorbability of low (15 mg) and high (268 mg) doses of vitamin E.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, crossover trial investigating the bioavailability of vitamin E in people with metabolic syndrome. It also examined the effects of dairy fat on vitamin E bioavailability.  Finding 1: Metabolic Syndrome Was Associated with Lower Vitamin E Levels  At the start of the study, circulating levels of vitamin E were similar between healthy participants and those with metabolic syndrome.  However, when vitamin E levels were corrected for plasma total lipids (µmol/mmol lipid) as recommended, the levels were lower in participants with metabolic syndrome, compared to those who were healthy ( 6 ).  These findings are shown in the chart below.   The results are supported by previous studies ( 5 ).  The lower levels of vitamin E may be explained by the chronic inflammation and oxidative stress associated with metabolic syndrome.  Accordingly, the study showed that participants with metabolic syndrome had higher levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (O-LDL), a marker of oxidative stress, and lower levels of vitamin C compared to healthy participants.   They also had higher levels of the inflammatory markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and C-reactive protein (CRP), as shown below.   High levels of oxidized LDL and inflammatory markers were associated with lower levels of vitamin E.  Yet, vitamin E depletion was slower in participants with metabolic syndrome, compared to those who were healthy.  Slower vitamin E depletion may indicate lower requirements, but vitamin E metabolism is likely more complicated than that.  Bottom Line: People with metabolic syndrome had lower circulating levels of vitamin E, compared to healthy individuals.  Finding 2: Vitamin E Bioavailability Was Lower in People with Metabolic Syndrome  Estimated vitamin E bioavailability was significantly lower in participants with metabolic syndrome, compared to healthy individuals.   Also, average and maximum levels of vitamin E in blood and lipoproteins were lower over the whole measurement period.  Why the bioavailability of vitamin E was lower in people with metabolic syndrome is unclear.  However, lower levels of vitamin E were associated with higher levels of oxidized LDL and inflammatory markers, suggesting that inflammation or oxidative stress might be involved.  The authors also speculated that metabolic syndrome might be associated with disrupted vitamin E metabolism in the liver or that vitamin E might be temporarily trapped in enterocytes, which are the cells lining the small intestine.  However, further studies are needed before any hard conclusions can be reached.  Bottom Line: The bioavailability of vitamin E was lower in people with metabolic syndrome, compared to healthy individuals.  Finding 3: Dairy Fat Did Not Affect the Absorption of Low-Dose Vitamin E  Dairy fat had no significant effects on vitamin E absorption, regardless of the participants’ health status.  The average vitamin E levels over each 72-hour study visit, presented as area under the curve (AUC), are shown in the chart below. These values represent both vitamin E bioavailability and depletion.   The results are inconsistent with two previous studies. One of them showed that vitamin E was better absorbed when taken with milk containing 1% fat, compared to orange juice ( 7 ).  Another study found that vitamin E absorption was greater when it was taken with whole milk, compared to low-fat milk ( 8 ).  However, these studies used very high amounts of vitamin E, or 150–200 mg. In comparison, the participants in the present study supplemented with 15 mg of vitamin E, which is equal to the Recommended Daily Allowance.  In the present study, the researchers also simulated milk digestion in a test tube. Their findings supported the human results – the fat content of milk did not affect the absorbability of 15 mg of vitamin E.  Yet, when the dose was increased to 268 mg, higher amounts of dairy fat significantly increased the potential absorbability of vitamin E.  Bottom Line: Dairy fat did not affect the absorption of vitamin E at low doses (15 mg). However, a test-tube experiment revealed that it may affect the potential absorbability of higher doses (268 mg) of vitamin E.  Limitations  The study didn’t appear to have many limitations, and the study design was excellent.  However, it didn’t allow the researchers to determine the absolute bioavailability of vitamin E. As a result, it may have been underestimated ( 9 ).  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that vitamin E bioavailability was lower in adults with metabolic syndrome, suggesting that a higher dietary intake of vitamin E might benefit them.  This is potentially explained by elevated inflammation and oxidative stress in these individuals.  Additionally, although fat is thought to increase vitamin E absorption, the bioavailability of low-dose vitamin E supplements (15 mg) seems to be unaffected.

	Thriftiness: Another Piece of the Obesity Puzzle  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 30, 2016  Not everyone is equal when it comes to losing weight.  Multiple factors determine whether people are successful or not. Growing evidence suggests that one of them is thriftiness.  Recently, a group of researchers examined the association of thriftiness with body fat and body temperature.  Today’s research review provides a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Calorie expenditure is the rate at which you burn calories.  Previous studies suggest that a “slow metabolism” or low resting calorie expenditure is not the underlying cause of obesity in most people.  In fact, obese people may burn more calories at rest, compared to normal-weight people, as we discussed previously .  Yet, growing evidence shows that other aspects of calorie expenditure may explain why some people have a greater tendency to gain weight over time.  In fact, people’s physiological response to calorie deficit or overfeeding significantly varies between individuals ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Some people are better adapted at preserving calories during periods of calorie deficit or malnutrition. These people are of the “thrifty phenotype.”  Most studies define thrifty individuals as having a greater decrease in calorie expenditure during fasting, compared to others ( 1 ).  This means that it’s more difficult for them to lose weight through dieting or fasting. One study showed that thrifty individuals lost less weight during a weight loss program ( 5 ).  It’s still unclear what causes people to become thrifty. Genetics may play a large role, but physical fitness or previous weight loss attempts could also be involved ( 6 , 7 ).  Article Reviewed  A team of scientists examined whether the decrease in calorie expenditure while fasting was associated with fat mass and body temperature.  Lower core body temperature and greater body fat are components of a human thrifty phenotype.  Study Design  This observational study examined whether changes in calorie expenditure in response to fasting were associated with body fat and body temperature.  The study was based on the results of two studies conducted at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in Phoenix, Arizona.  Data from 77 men and women who participated in the studies was included in the final analyses. Their body mass index ranged from 17.8 to 50.  The researchers examined how calorie expenditure changed during three 24-hour periods — weight maintenance, overeating and fasting — during which the participants spent their time at the research unit.  During the 24-hours of weight maintenance and overeating the participants followed a standard diet.  The diet consisted of 4 meals (breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack and dinner) and provided 50% of calories from carbs, 30% from fat and 20% from protein.  While the participants stayed at the research unit, the researchers measured the following:   Body weight: Each morning, the participants’ body weight was measured shortly after they woke up.  Body composition: The participants’ body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The measurements included percent body fat, fat mass, abdominal fat and fat-free mass.  Calorie expenditure: For 24 hours, starting 30 minutes after the participants finished breakfast, their calorie expenditure was assessed using a whole-room indirect calorimeter.  Core body temperature: Body temperature was measured continuously using small sensors equipped with transmitters. The participants swallowed the sensors shortly after they woke up.   Bottom Line: This was an observational study examining how the response of calorie expenditure to fasting (starvation response) was associated with body fat and body temperature.  Finding 1: Fasting Decreased Calorie Expenditure  The study showed that calorie expenditure decreased by 8%, on average, during fasting.  This is a natural response that reduces the risk of starvation during periods of food shortage, also known as starvation response, starvation mode, metabolic adaptation or adaptive thermogenesis ( 8 ).  One study suggested that the starvation response may in some cases persist over a few years, as discussed in our previous research review ( 9 ).  Bottom Line: Fasting for 24 hours significantly decreased calorie expenditure. This effect is known as the starvation response or adaptive thermogenesis.  Finding 2: Overeating Increased Calorie Expenditure  On average, overeating caused a 9.7% increase in calorie expenditure.  This effect is known as diet-induced thermogenesis or the thermic effect of food (TEF).  Previous studies indicate that TEF is influenced by various factors. For example, high-protein meals cause a greater TEF , compared to high-carb meals, and it appears to be stronger early in the day .  Bottom Line: Overeating for 24 hours caused a significant increase in calorie expenditure. This phenomenon is known as the thermic effect of food.  Finding 3: Some Individuals Had a Thrifty Phenotype  Not everyone responded to calorie deficit or excess in the same way. In fact, the response varied significantly between individuals.  Based on this response, the researchers divided the participants into two categories: thrifty and spendthrift individuals.  Specifically, thrifty individuals were below the median for the 24-hour response of calorie expenditure to fasting, whereas spendthrift individuals were above it ( 5 ).  The chart below shows the average differences in the responses of calorie expenditure to fasting and overeating.   Bottom Line: The researchers divided the participants into two categories – thrifty and spendthrift – depending on how their calorie expenditure changed in response to 24-hour fasting.  Finding 4: Thrifty Individuals Had Lower Body Temperature  The analyses of body temperature were limited to men, since body temperature may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle in women.  Thrifty individuals had a significantly lower core body temperature while fasting, overfeeding and during weight maintenance.  On average, thrifty men had a 0.29 °F lower core body temperature, compared to spendthrift men, as shown in the chart below.   Body temperature and starvation response were significantly associated. Specifically, a 0.18 °F drop in core body temperature was linked to a 1.4% greater decrease in calorie expenditure during fasting.  A few previous observational studies have found that obese individuals have a lower body temperature, compared to normal-weight people, but not all studies agree ( 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ).  Bottom Line: Thrifty individuals had a lower body temperature, compared to spendthrift individuals.  Finding 5: Thrifty Individuals Had More Body Fat  Those who were categorized as thrifty had significantly greater total fat mass and abdominal fat, compared to those who were spendthrift.  On average, thrifty individuals had 17.7 lb more fat mass and 4.8 lb more abdominal fat, compared to spendthrift individuals. These findings are presented in the chart below.   Similar results were obtained when the analyses were limited to men.  A greater decrease in calorie expenditure was also associated with greater total fat mass and abdominal fat. This association remained significant after taking age, gender, race and ambient temperature into account.  These results suggest that thrifty individuals have a greater tendency to gain weight, compared to their spendthrift counterparts.  They may also have greater difficulty losing weight while dieting. This is supported by one previous trial showing that thrifty, obese individuals were less successful at losing weight during a 6-week weight loss program that reduced calories by 50% ( 5 ).  Bottom Line: Thrifty individuals had lower total body fat and abdominal fat, compared to spendthrift individuals.  Limitations  The main limitation of the study was its observational design.  Although the results are valid, they do not allow any conclusions about causality.  For example, it is unknown whether thriftiness leads to obesity, or if obesity makes people thrifty. However, previous studies support the former possibility ( 5 , 15 ).  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study confirms that some obese people are better at conserving calories than others.  The authors labeled them as “thrifty.” Thrifty individuals tended to have greater total fat mass, abdominal fat and lower body temperature, compared to those who were “spendthrift.”  What’s more, the starvation response of thrifty individuals was stronger, and the thermic effect of food was weaker.  Although these findings have limited real-life application, they show that not everyone is equal when it comes to losing weight.  Tags: metabolism , Obesity , Weight loss

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (May 20th–27th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 27, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, May 20th to Friday, May 27th, 2016.  Here are some of the more interesting findings this week:   Slow metabolism is not to blame for obesity.  Fatty acids produced by gut bacteria affect appetite.  Early-life body composition may affect later weight.  Decreasing salt intake may reduce blood pressure.  Soy does not significantly affect inflammatory markers.  Certain foods may reduce the risk of depression.  Vitamin D may have benefits for fertility.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two papers: one on the association of obesity with calorie expenditure and another on a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of short-chain fatty acids on reward-driven eating behavior.   Review:  Is Weight Gain Caused by a “Slow Metabolism”?  Article:  Is Obesity Associated with Altered Energy Expenditure?  Summary: This review looked at the available evidence linking obesity with changes in calorie expenditure.  The authors concluded that obese people burn more calories at rest, compared to non-obese individuals. Therefore, slow metabolism is not to blame for obesity, at least not in the majority of people.   Review:  Fatty Acids Produced by Gut Bacteria Reduce Appetite.  Article:  Increased colonic propionate reduces anticipatory reward responses in the human striatum to high-energy foods.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of elevated colonic propionate formation on calorie intake and food reward-driven eating behavior in humans.  The study showed that increased levels of propionate in the colon affected brain signals linked to appetite regulation, reduced calorie intake and decreased the appeal of high-calorie foods.   New Research from Around the World  A number of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Blood  Women’s Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Appetite-regulating hormones in early life and relationships with type of feeding and body composition in healthy term infants.  Body composition early in life may affect people’s risk of becoming obese later in life. Levels of appetite hormones might play a role in this association.  This observational study in preterm infants found that breastfeeding was linked to higher levels of ghrelin, leptin and insulin, compared to formula-feeding. These results suggest that breastfeeding may protect against weight gain and obesity.   Higher Dietary Choline and Betaine Intakes Are Associated with Better Body Composition in the Adult Population of Newfoundland, Canada.  This observational study in Canadian adults found that choline and betaine intakes were associated with reduced body fat. These findings are supported by animal studies.  Choline is an essential nutrient found in high amounts in eggs, liver and fish roe (caviar), whereas betaine (trimethylglycine) is found in quinoa, spinach and beets, to name a few.   No insulating effect of obesity.  Scientists have speculated that high levels of body fat might insulate against cold, reducing the calorie expenditure associated with heat loss.  However, this study in mice suggests that obesity does not reduce heat loss. Human studies are needed before any strong conclusions can be reached.   Breakfast consumption and weight-loss maintenance: results from the MedWeight study.  This observational study suggests that men who regularly eat breakfast are more likely to be successful at maintaining their weight after a weight-loss program. A similar association was not seen in women.   Associations between eating frequency and energy intake, energy density, diet quality and body weight status in adults from the USA.  This observational study of US adults found that higher eating frequency was associated with a lower energy density of the foods eaten and a higher score on the Healthy Eating Index 2010.  High eating frequency was also linked to a lower body mass index in women and a lower waist circumference in both men and women.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Egg consumption and risk of incident type 2 diabetes: a dose–response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  This meta-analysis of prospective observational studies found that high egg consumption was linked to a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  When the studies were analyzed depending on country, the association turned out to be significant only in the US. The authors concluded that the results might be explained by other lifestyle factors associated with egg consumption.   3. Heart Health  Association Between Protein Intake and Mortality in Hypertensive Patients Without Chronic Kidney Disease in the OLD-HTA Cohort.  Some studies indicate that protein intake may help protect against high blood pressure and heart disease. However, this is still a matter of debate.  This observational study in people with high blood pressure found that protein intake above 0.32 g for each pound (or 0.7 g for each kg) of their ideal body weight reduced the risk of death from heart disease or all causes.   Healthful Dietary Patterns and the Risk of Hypertension Among Women With a History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective Cohort Study.  Women with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of developing high blood pressure later in life.  This observational study showed that adhering to healthy dietary patterns, such as the alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010, the DASH diet or the alternative Mediterranean diet, was linked to a lower risk of developing high blood pressure.   Modest Salt Reduction Lowers Blood Pressure and Albumin Excretion in Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Double-Blind Trial.  This 12-week randomized controlled trial examined the effects of modest dietary salt reduction on blood pressure in people with poor blood sugar control and normal or mildly-elevated blood pressure.  The study showed that a modest reduction in salt intake, or approximately 2.9 grams, led to a clinically relevant decrease in blood pressure.   4. Cancer  The Effect of Reduced Dietary Fat and Soy Supplementation on Circulating Adipocytokines in Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Controlled 2-Month Trial.  Previous observational studies in Asian women have suggested that regularly eating soy products may reduce the risk of breast cancer by decreasing inflammation. However, short-term trials have found limited effects of soy on inflammatory markers.  This 8-week trial in postmenopausal women examined the effects of supplementing with either 50 mg/day of soy isoflavones, 15 g/day of soy protein from tofu or following a very low-fat diet. None significantly affected inflammatory markers.   Association of Vitamin D Levels With Outcome in Patients With Melanoma After Adjustment For C-Reactive Protein.  Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. The main risk factors are excessive exposure to ultraviolet light, sunburns and pale skin.  This observational study showed that higher circulating levels of vitamin D were associated with better treatment outcomes in patients with melanoma. High vitamin D levels were also linked to lower levels of the inflammatory marker CRP.   5. Brain and Mental Health  The effect of daily zinc and/or multivitamin supplements on early childhood development in Tanzania: results from a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in Tanzanian infants showed that supplementing with zinc and/or multivitamins (vitamins C, E and a B-complex) for one year had no effects on their mental development, compared to a placebo.   Curcumin and cognition: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of community-dwelling older adults.  Previous studies examining the effects of curcumin on mental function have provided mixed results. This 12-month randomized controlled trial in older adults examined the effects of supplementing with 1500 mg/day of BiocurcumaxTM.  The study suggests that curcumin may prevent a decline in mental function, according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. However, other measurements revealed no significant effects.   The association between dietary patterns derived by reduced rank regression and depressive symptoms over time: the Invecchiare in Chianti (InCHIANTI) study.  This prospective observational study examined the association of food groups or dietary components with depressive symptoms.  It showed that a diet rich in vegetables, olive oil, grains, fruits and fish and moderate in wine and red meat were consistently linked to a lower risk of depression.   6. Liver Health  Liver-related safety assessment of green tea extracts in humans: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.  There are concerns that supplementing with a green tea extract may cause liver damage in some people. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials suggests that liver damage after eating green tea extract is rare.  Randomized controlled trials have reported no serious liver-related side effects, and most cases were mild. Currently, normal intake of green tea extract is considered safe in healthy people.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Carbohydrate mouth rinsing has no effect on power output during cycling in a glycogen-reduced state.  This small study compared the effects of carb mouth rinsing and carb consumption on power output among male cyclists who had fasted overnight.  The study showed that eating carbs after fasting increased power output during cycling, compared to a placebo. In contrast, mouth rinsing with carbs had no such effects.   The impact of post-exercise hydration with deep-ocean mineral water on rehydration and exercise performance.  Deep-ocean mineral water (DMW) is found at ocean depths of 820–4,921 ft (250–1,500 meters) and rich in various minerals. This study suggests drinking DMW may result in faster rehydration, compared with spring water or a carb-based sports drink.   8. Arthritis  Omega-3 fatty acids are associated with a lower prevalence of autoantibodies in shared epitope-positive subjects at risk for rheumatoid arthritis.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the joints. The main symptoms are swollen and painful joints, most commonly in the hands. It may eventually lead to deformed joints and physical disability.  This observational study suggests that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce RA in a subgroup of people at risk, specifically those with HLA class II genetic susceptibility to RA.   9. Blood  An open-label randomized parallel-group comparative study of the efficacy of sorghum bicolor extract in preoperative anemia.  Sorghum is the world’s fifth most common cereal crop.  This study in anemic patients showed that supplementing with 5mg/day of folic acid, 200 mg/day of iron and 500 mg/day of sorghum extract didn’t significantly improve anemia, compared to folic acid and iron alone.   Effects of two therapeutic dietary regimens on primary chylomicronemia in paediatric age: a retrospective data analysis.  Primary chylomicronemia (PC) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by high blood levels of lipoproteins known as chylomicrons, resulting in excessive circulating levels of triglycerides. People with PC are at a high risk of inflammation in the pancreas.  This study in children with PC showed that following a low-fat diet and supplementing with omega-3 fats for at least 5 months caused a significant decrease in triglyceride levels. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of this treatment.   10. Women’s Health  Vitamin D Status Relates to Reproductive Outcome in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Secondary Analysis of a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by cysts on the ovaries and an imbalance in hormone levels. This may lead to difficulties getting pregnant, irregular periods and an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease.  This observational study in women with PCOS found that high circulating levels of vitamin D were associated with increased fertility following a fertility treatment known as ovulation induction.

	Fatty Acids Produced by Gut Bacteria Reduce Appetite  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 25, 2016  The most important health function of prebiotic fiber is to increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon.  Not only do these fatty acids benefit colon health, but they also play a role in regulating appetite.  Recently, a team of researchers examined the effects of elevated propionate, which is one of the most common SCFAs, on calorie intake and brain signals involved with food reward-driven eating behavior.  Today’s review provides a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Fiber is a key component of a healthy diet.  This especially applies to prebiotic fiber, which sustains the beneficial bacteria living in your digestive system.  When reaching the colon, prebiotic fiber is fermented by intestinal bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), mainly acetate, butyrate and propionate ( 1 ).  Growing evidence indicates that SCFAs produced by bacteria in the colon may affect appetite regulation in the brain ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  One study in rodents showed that elevated amounts of acetate in the blood suppressed appetite by affecting brain function ( 4 ).  Another human study found that increasing the formation of propionate in the colon by supplementing with inulin-propionate ester was associated with a reduced food intake and protected against weight gain ( 5 ).  However, until now, no studies have examined the potential effects of colon-derived SCFAs on the human brain.  Article Reviewed  A team of researchers examined the effects of elevated short-chain fatty acid formation in the colon on reward-driven eating behavior in humans.  Increased colonic propionate reduces anticipatory reward responses in the human striatum to high-energy foods.  Study Design  This randomized, crossover trial examined the effects of increasing propionate formation in the colon on eating behavior.  A total of 20 healthy men, aged 18 to 65, participated in the study. Their body mass indexes ranged from 20 to 35.  They were assigned to receive two supplements in a random order:   Inulin: A soluble fiber that promotes the formation of SCFAs (acetate, butyrate and propionate) in the colon.  Inulin-propionate ester (IPE): Previous studies suggest that IPE provides similar amounts of acetate and butyrate as inulin but higher amounts of propionate ( 5 ).   After an overnight fast, the supplements were taken with breakfast when the participants visited the lab. The two lab visits were separated by at least 6 days.  The breakfast consisted of a standard chocolate milk shake and snack bar with 10 grams of either IPE (treatment) or inulin (control).  During each visit, the researchers measured the following:   Brain activity: 5 hours after breakfast the researchers measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while the participants looked at pictures of low- and high-calorie foods.  Food appeal: While the participants were looking at the food images, they were asked to rate how appealing they found each of the foods, on a scale of 1 to 5.  Blood values: Blood samples were collected to measure circulating levels of insulin, glucose and two appetite-suppressing hormones: glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY).  Self-rated appetite: The participants were asked to rate their appetite and mood using visual analog scale questionnaires.  Breath hydrogen: The concentration of breath hydrogen was measured to assess the level of fermentation in the colon.  Food intake: At the end of each lab visit, the participants’ food intake was assessed by serving them a large meal consisting of a savory tomato and mozzarella pasta bake.   Bottom Line: This was a randomized, controlled trial examining the effects of elevated colonic propionate formation on calorie intake, appetite and food reward-related brain activity.  Finding 1: Colonic Propionate Reduced Food Intake  Supplementing with inulin-propionate ester (IPE) reduced food intake at an experimental meal by 9.5%, compared to supplementing with inulin.  These results are shown in the chart below:   The findings are supported by one previous human study showing that supplementing with IPE reduced food intake significantly ( 5 ).  The researchers concluded that these differences were likely due to elevated levels of propionate in the colon after the IPE supplement.  Changes in levels of insulin, glucose and the appetite-suppressing hormones GLP-1 and peptide YY were not significantly different between supplements, suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with inulin-propionate ester (IPE), which increases propionate levels in the colon, reduced calorie intake at an experimental meal, compared to supplementing with inulin.  Finding 2: Colonic Propionate Suppressed Reward Signals in the Brain  The researchers measured brain activity – the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal – in brain regions that have previously been associated with food reward processing ( 6 ).  Supplementing with IPE suppressed food reward-related brain signals when the participants looked at images of food more than supplementing with inulin did.  Suppression of these brain signals was detected in two brain regions — the nucleus accumbens and caudate. It was greater when the participants looked at images of high-calorie foods, compared to low-calorie foods.  In fact, brain signals in the caudate were only suppressed by images of high-calorie foods, but not low-calorie foods.  The findings are presented in the chart below.   These results indicate that propionate suppressed food intake by affecting reward-driven eating behavior, although the researchers didn’t find any significant association between changes in brain signals and food intake.  Reduced BOLD signals have previously been linked to suppressed appetite and reduced appeal of high-calorie foods ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ).  However, this is the first study to suggest that propionate may affect these signals in humans.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with IPE suppressed brain activity in brain regions involved with food reward processing.  Finding 3: Colonic Propionate Made High-Calorie Foods Less Appealing  After the participants supplemented with IPE, they found high-calorie foods less appealing, according to ratings of food images.  It also took them longer to rate the images, which may indicate reduced appetite ( 11 , 12 ).  However, self-rated appetite, as evaluated by visual analog scale questionnaires, was not significantly different between supplements.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with IPE made images of high-calorie foods less appealing, compared to supplementing with inulin.  Finding 4: Prebiotic Fiber Increased Fermentation in the Colon  Hydrogen gas is a by-product of fiber or carb fermentation in the colon. A large proportion of it is absorbed into your blood and released into your breath.  Since there are no other major sources of hydrogen in the human body, breath hydrogen levels are used to assess how much fermentation is taking place in the colon ( 13 ).  In the present study, breath hydrogen levels had increased significantly 3.5 hours after taking the supplements and stayed high until the end of the study visit.  Supplementing with inulin led to significantly greater breath hydrogen levels than IPE. This is because inulin contains higher amounts of fermentable fiber, or 10 grams, compared to 7.3 grams in the IPE supplement.  Circulating levels of butyrate also increased after supplementing with inulin and IPE, but the increase was not significantly different between supplements.  Bottom Line: Both supplements led to increased fiber fermentation in the colon, according to hydrogen breath tests.  Limitations  The study’s design appears excellent. However, there are a few limitations to the interpretation of its findings.  First, all of the participants were men, and none of them severely obese. The findings might not apply to women or severely obese people and need to be confirmed in these groups.  Second, the study examined the appetite and brain responses after a single dose of inulin or IPE. The long-term effects of these supplements on brain function need to be investigated.  Summary and Real-Life Application  The study showed that increased colonic formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), specifically propionate, may temporarily reduce calorie intake and the appeal of high-calorie foods.  This is supported by previous studies in both humans and animals, but this is the first study to show that propionate affects brain regions involved with food reward-driven behavior in humans.  Simply put, prebiotic fiber may play an important role in appetite regulation through its effects on SCFA formation in the colon.  Tags: Appetite , Gut microbiota , Prebiotics , Weight loss

	Is Weight Gain Caused by a “Slow Metabolism”?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 23, 2016  For decades scientists have suspected that obese people might have a “slow metabolism,” burning fewer calories than normal-weight individuals.  However, this hypothesis is controversial. A new review was published recently looking at the available evidence.  This is what they discovered.   Article Reviewed  This was a scientific review on the association of obesity with changes in calorie expenditure.  Is Obesity Associated with Altered Energy Expenditure?  What is Calorie Expenditure?  Calorie expenditure is the rate at which you burn calories. Along with oxygen, calories are the fuel that keeps your metabolism running.  Calorie expenditure is divided into the following categories:   Basal energy expenditure (BEE): The amount of calories used to maintain vital body functions.  Resting energy expenditure (REE): The amount of calories burned by the body during rest. REE accounts for 50â75% of total energy expenditure ( 1 ).  Activity energy expenditure (AEE): Physical activity increases the amount of calories burned.  Thermic effect of food (TEF): Eating causes a temporary rise in the amount of calories burned, known as diet-induced thermogenesis.   Bottom Line: Calorie expenditure is divided into several subcategories, such as resting and activity energy expenditure. Together, they comprise total calorie expenditure.  Can Low Calorie Expenditure Cause Obesity?  Weight gain is caused by an imbalance of calories eaten and burned ( 2 ).  Calorie intake and expenditure depend, to a large extent, on your behavior.   Calorie intake: You can reduce calorie intake by eating less and choosing foods that are low in calories. However, for many people, this is difficult because of a lack of knowledge, low motivation, eating disorders or food addiction.  Calorie expenditure: You can burn more calories by using your muscles, exercising, gaining muscle and eating protein. For many people, this is difficult due to lack of motivation, a desk job or a physical disability.   Changing either calorie intake or expenditure can shift the balance, leading to either weight gain or loss over time ( 3 ).  For this reason, sedentary activities, lack of exercise and poor muscle mass are among the many factors contributing to weight gain and obesity ( 4 , 5 ).  However, calorie expenditure is affected by various factors and not completely adjustable. Most notably, it is determined by age, gender and genetics.  Bottom Line: Along with calorie intake, calorie expenditure strongly affects your body’s energy balance. Relative to calorie intake, low calorie expenditure leads to weight gain over time.  Do Obese Individuals Burn Fewer Calories?  Obese individuals have traditionally been thought to have a “slow metabolism” ( 6 ).  However, most studies point to the opposite, suggesting that obese individuals have higher total and resting calorie expenditures, compared to non-obese people ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ).  Specifically, the difference was, on average, 360 kcal/day. The difference ranged from 49 kcal/day to 826 kcal/day, depending on the level of obesity, and was highest when severely obese individuals were compared to normal-weight people.  This may be because obese individuals tend to have higher amounts of metabolically active fat-free mass â mainly muscles. When people gain large amounts of fat, they also tend to gain muscle mass to support the additional weight ( 8 , 11 , 12 ).  Yet, a few studies suggest that resting calorie expenditure may be higher in obese individuals regardless of the higher fat-free mass ( 13 , 14 ).  In contrast, a few studies suggest that the rise in calorie expenditure after eating (thermic effect of food) may be lower in obese people, but the evidence is mixed and inconclusive ( 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ).  Overall, obese people may burn more calories than normal-weight people, suggesting that slow metabolism is not to blame.  Nevertheless, some individuals may burn fewer calories while dieting or fasting, making it harder for them to lose weight ( 18 ).  Bottom Line: Obese individuals tend to burn more calories at rest, compared to normal-weight individuals. Most studies suggest that differences in fat-free mass may explain these findings.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this review showed that obese individuals burn more calories at rest, compared to normal-weight people.  This is partly because they have more muscle mass to support the excess weight.  Taken together, these findings suggest that a slow metabolism is generally not an underlying cause of obesity, at least not in the average person.  Tags: Calories , Metabolic rate , Obesity

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (May 13th–20th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 20, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, May 13th to Friday, May 20th, 2016.  Here are some of the more interesting findings this week:   Artificial sweetener use in pregnancy linked to obesity in the child.  High-fat dairy products linked to a major reduction in type 2 diabetes risk.  The benefits of eating plenty of unprocessed fruits and vegetables.  Plant omega-3s don’t lower heart disease risk.  Polyunsaturated fats may improve heart disease risk factors more than monounsaturated fats.  How probiotic use affects cancer risk.  How weight stigma makes overweight people anxious and causes them to eat more.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two papers: one on the association between artificial sweetener consumption during pregnancy and obesity in the child and another about the links between dairy fat consumption and type 2 diabetes.   Review:  Artificial Sweeteners in Pregnancy and Obesity in The Child.  Article:  Association Between Artificially Sweetened Beverage Consumption During Pregnancy and Infant Body Mass Index.  Summary: This observational study found that a high intake of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy was linked to an increased risk of obesity in the child.   Review:  High-Fat Dairy Linked to Drastically Reduced Diabetes Risk.  Article:  Circulating Biomarkers of Dairy Fat and Risk of Incident Diabetes Mellitus Among Men and Women in the United States in Two Large Prospective Cohorts.  Summary: This observational study suggested that eating a lot of dairy fat may protect against type 2 diabetes.   New Research from Around the World  Many new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Skin Health  Healthy Aging  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Distribution of energy intake throughout the day and weight gain: a population-based cohort study in Spain.  This observational study showed that higher calorie intake at lunch was associated with a lower risk of weight gain. The findings suggest that the timing of calorie intake during the day may play a role in obesity.   Changes in water and sugar-containing beverage consumption and body weight outcomes in children.  This observational study in children found that water consumption (1 glass/day) was not linked to body mass index.  However, the findings suggest that water may replace sugar-sweetened beverages, which were associated with an increased body mass index and a greater risk of obesity.   Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that adolescents with intellectual disabilities are at 1.8 times greater risk of obesity, compared to typical adolescents.   Does neighborhood fast-food outlet exposure amplify inequalities in diet and obesity? A cross-sectional study.  This observational study suggests that easy access to fast food outlets, combined with low education levels, may predispose people to a greater risk of gaining weight and becoming obese.   Low energy intake plus low energy expenditure (low energy flux), not energy surfeit, predicts future body fat gain.  This observational study indicates that low calorie expenditure due to low metabolic rate or physical activity predicts future weight gain more than excess calorie intake.   2. Heart Health  Adult Intake of Minimally Processed Fruits and Vegetables: Associations with Cardiometabolic Disease Risk Factors.  This observational study in adults without heart disease or metabolic disorders found that a high intake of minimally processed fruits and non-starch vegetables, relative to total food intake, was associated with less body fat and lower insulin levels.   Acute effects of quercetin-3-O-glucoside on endothelial function and blood pressure: a randomized dose-response study.  Quercetin-3-O-glucoside , also known as isoquercetin, is a flavonoid antioxidant found in many fruits and vegetables.  This randomized controlled study showed that one dose of isoquercetin, ranging from 50 to 400 mg, has no effect on blood pressure or blood vessel function.   Dietary intake and adipose tissue content of α-linolenic acid and risk of myocardial infarction: a Danish cohort study.  Previous studies indicate that a high dietary intake of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid may reduce the risk of heart disease, but their findings are inconsistent.  This prospective observational study indicates that alpha-linolenic acid has no significant effects on the risk of heart attacks.   Poly is more Effective than Mono – Unsaturated Fat For dietary management IN the Metabolic Syndrome: The MUFFIN Study.  This was a randomized controlled study in middle-aged people with metabolic syndrome who followed a diet enriched with either monounsaturated fat (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) for half a year.  The study found that following a diet high in PUFA caused a greater reduction in triglycerides, blood pressure and blood vessel function than a diet rich in MUFA.   3. Cancer  The Potential Role of Probiotics in Cancer Prevention and Treatment.  This review discusses the possible use of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of cancer. The authors conclude that supplementing with probiotics may reduce diarrhea in patients undergoing radio- or chemotherapy.  Supplementing with probiotics may also promote general health, helping to prevent lifestyle-related cancer, as well as other chronic diseases.   Alcohol Intake is Associated with Increased Risk of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin: Three US Prospective Cohort Studies.  This observational study showed that alcohol intake was associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.  Specifically, each additional drink (12.8 grams of ethanol) was linked to a 22% increased risk of a type of skin cancer known as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.   4. Appetite and Eating  Weight stigma and eating behavior: A review of the literature.  Overweight and obese people are sometimes frowned upon. This form of social devaluation is known as weight stigma. It is a source of anxiety for many people, but not all obese people experience it.  This review suggests that experiencing weight stigma may worsen unhealthy eating behaviors and reduce people’s motivation to diet and exercise.   Paved with good intentions: Paradoxical eating responses to weight stigma.  Some people believe that overweight and obese people could easily lose weight if they really wanted to. They consider obese people to be greedy, excessive and selfish, rather than victims of a disorder.  This review concludes that weight stigma may promote overeating and reduce people’s interest in losing weight. The findings suggest that low self-esteem and social discrimination may decrease motivation.   Weight-related teasing and non-normative eating behaviors as predictors of weight loss maintenance. A longitudinal mediation analysis.  This observational study found that weight-related teasing reduced people’s chance of successfully maintaining their weight after weight loss.  It suggests that the anxiety and low self-esteem associated with weight-related teasing made people more prone to emotional eating, which is the tendency to overeat in response to negative emotions.   Internalized weight stigma moderates eating behavior outcomes in women with high BMI participating in a healthy living program.  This study in obese women examined the effect of self-perceived weight stigma on dysfunctional eating behavior after a weight loss program.  The study found that women who experienced a lot of weight stigma were less likely to change their eating behavior, compared to women who perceived less weight stigma.   Increased colonic propionate reduces anticipatory reward responses in the human striatum to high-energy foods.  Short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate and propionate, are formed in the colon when intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fiber. Animal research indicates that increased production of propionate may reduce calorie intake.  This randomized controlled trial supports earlier research suggesting that high propionate production in the colon may reduce reward-driven eating behavior in humans.   5. Skin Health  Consuming High-Carotenoid Fruit and Vegetables Influences Skin Yellowness and Plasma Carotenoids in Young Women: A Single-Blind Randomized Crossover Trial.  Carotenoids are a class of antioxidant pigments found in plants. Eating lots of carotenoid-rich fruit and vegetables leads to their accumulation in human skin, making it more yellow.  This randomized controlled trial showed that a diet high in carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables (7 servings a day for one month) led to significantly greater skin yellowness, compared to a diet consisting of low-carotenoid fruits and vegetables.   6. Healthy Aging  Pork and Chicken Meals Similarly Impact on Cognitive Function and Strength in Community-Living Older Adults: A Pilot Study.  This study in elderly people showed that eating pork meals 4 times per week for 3 months did not improve strength, physical performance or mental function, compared to similar meals containing chicken.   7. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Gluten free diet and nutrient deficiencies: a review.  The only treatment for gluten intolerance is lifelong avoidance of gluten-containing foods. This review examined the possible nutrient insufficiences of gluten-free diets.  Some nutrients may be of short supply, especially fiber, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate, iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium. However, many of these nutrient insufficiencies are not specific to gluten-free diets but to people’s diets in general.   Free 25-hydroxyvitamin D is low in obesity, but there are no adverse associations with bone health.  25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the main circulating form of vitamin D in the body. Its levels are believed to accurately reflect people’s vitamin D status.  This observational study in normal-weight, overweight and obese men and women showed that 25(OH)D levels decrease with a higher body mass index. This is supported by previous studies, but the reason for this association is still unknown.   Tags: Weekly recap

	High-Fat Dairy Linked to Drastically Reduced Diabetes Risk  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 18, 2016  Despite having been considered harmful in the past, new studies have failed to find a link between saturated animal fat and heart disease.  Additionally, not all saturated fats are created equal, and some of them may even be beneficial. This may be particularly true of dairy fat, which contains fatty acids that can have biological effects.  Today’s study looks at the relationship between high-fat dairy consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes.   Background  In the past decades, dairy fat may have been unfairly demonized.  In fact, the evidence against dairy fat is severely limited, and the majority of the evidence suggests that it has no effect on heart disease risk ( 1 , 2 ).  Yet, many current dietary guidelines still recommend a limited intake of full-fat dairy.  Dairy fat’s association to type 2 diabetes has been much less studied. Observational studies have provided mixed results, suggesting that dairy fat may have neutral or beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).  Previous observational studies have relied on self-reported intake of dairy fat, which tends to be inaccurate. A better approach is to directly measure circulating markers of dairy fat intake.  Dairy fat contains a few types of rare fatty acids, such as pentadecanoic acid , margaric acid and trans-palmitoleic acid , not found in significant amounts in other foods ( 6 , 7 , 8 ).  Therefore, their blood levels may indicate how much dairy fat a person eats ( 9 , 10 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers from Harvard and Tufts University examined whether circulating markers of dairy fat intake were associated with type 2 diabetes risk.  Circulating Biomarkers of Dairy Fat and Risk of Incident Diabetes Mellitus Among Men and Women in the United States in Two Large Prospective Cohorts.  Study Design  This prospective observational study examined the association between circulating markers of dairy fat intake and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  It included 3,333 adults from two previous observational studies â the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.  The participants were 30â75 years old, and half of them were overweight or obese. However, none had type 2 diabetes, heart disease or cancer at the start of the study.  The researchers took blood samples and analyzed the amounts and types of circulating fatty acids in the participants’ blood fluid (plasma) and red blood cells.  After an average of 15 years, they were tested for type 2 diabetes by questionnaire.  Finally, the researchers used statistics (pooled multivariate analyses) to examine the association of type 2 diabetes with circulating levels of pentadecanoic, margaric and trans-palmitoleic acids.  Bottom Line: This prospective observational study examined the association between type 2 diabetes and markers of dairy fat intake.  Finding 1: Markers of Dairy Fat Intake Were Linked to a Lower Risk of Diabetes  During the 15 years of follow-up, 277 new cases of type 2 diabetes were diagnosed.  This study showed that individuals with high levels of pentadecanoic, margaric and trans-palmitoleic acids in their blood fluid (plasma) were at a significantly lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  Specifically, those in the highest quartile of pentadecanoic acid (PA) levels were at a 44% lower risk of becoming diabetic, compared to those in the lowest quartile.  Similarly, high margaric acid (MA) levels were linked to a 43% lower risk, while trans-palmitoleic acid (TPA) levels were linked to a 52% lower risk.  The findings are presented in the charts below.    These results are supported by several previous observational studies ( 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ).  Similar results were obtained when fatty acid levels in red blood cells were examined, although only margaric acid remained significantly associated with a lower risk of diabetes.  Bottom Line: Circulating markers of dairy fat intake were significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.  Why Might Dairy Fat Reduce the Risk of Diabetes?  The factors responsible for the associations seen in the present study are unknown.  They might be any of the fatty acids examined, other related factors in milk or lifestyle factors associated with high dairy fat consumption.  Scientists have suggested that several milk fat constituents may play a role. These include vitamin D, omega-3 fats, short- and medium-chain fats and gangliosides ( 16 ).  In the present study, when all three markers of dairy fat were added to the same statistical model, only trans-palmitoleic acid remained significantly associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.  The authors speculated that trans-palmitoleic acid might affect type 2 diabetes due to its similarities to palmitoleic acid, which is a fatty acid that may reduce liver fat production and improve insulin sensitivity in muscles ( 17 , 18 ).  However, before a solid conclusion can be reached, the individual milk fat components need to be examined in randomized controlled studies.  Bottom Line: Why dairy fat might protect against type 2 diabetes is unclear. The authors suggest that trans-palmitoleic acid may be responsible.  Limitations  The study’s primary limitation was its observational design, which was otherwise excellent.  Additionally, only 71% of the participants were fasting when blood samples were taken. However, this is unlikely to have significantly affected the results.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study suggests that eating high-fat dairy products, such as cheese, butter and cream, may protect against diabetes.  However, it did have an observational design, meaning that its findings do not provide any hard evidence about causality.  Regardless, dairy fat appears to be a healthy dietary component. The majority of studies suggests that dairy fat is not the villain it was previously made out to be.  Tags: Dairy , Diabetes , Saturated fat

	Artificial Sweeteners in Pregnancy and Obesity in The Child  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 16, 2016  The use of artificial sweeteners has increased dramatically in recent decades.  At the same time, obesity rates have skyrocketed. However, the link between artificial sweetener use and obesity is controversial.  A new study was just done that examines the use of artificial sweeteners in pregnancy and the risk of obesity in child.  The findings were very interesting, and are outlined below.   Background  More than 30% of pregnant women may regularly consume artificially sweetened beverages ( 1 , 2 ).  Animal studies suggest that when unborn offspring are exposed to artificial sweeteners they are more likely to develop overweight or obesity after birth ( 3 , 4 ).  They also tend to have greater preferences for sweet foods, changed blood lipid profiles and increased insulin resistance ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  However, until now, this association has never been examined in humans.  Article Reviewed  This study assessed the consumption of artificial sweeteners among pregnant mothers and examined its association with infant body mass index.  Association Between Artificially Sweetened Beverage Consumption During Pregnancy and Infant Body Mass Index  Study Design  This was an observational cohort study examining the link between maternal consumption of artificial sweeteners and infant obesity.  It included 2686 healthy, pregnant women from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study.  The dietary intake of these women was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire during the second or third trimester of pregnancy.  One year after birth, the researchers measured the body mass index (BMI) of their children.  Bottom Line: This observational study examined the association of artificial sweetener intake among pregnant mothers and infant body mass index at age one.  Finding: Maternal Consumption of Artificial Sweeteners Was Linked With an Increased Risk of Infant Overweight  More than a quarter of the women in this study consumed artificial sweeteners during pregnancy.  At one year of age, the children of those women who consumed a lot of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those who consumed less.  Additionally, they were twice as likely to be overweight at age one, compared to those who weren’t exposed to artificial sweeteners while still in the womb.  Infants of women who consumed artificially sweetened beverages were 119% more likely to be overweight at 1 year, compared to women who consumed them less than once per month.  When the analysis was done separately for each gender, the researchers found that maternal intake of artificial sweeteners was only linked with body weight in boys. This is supported by a study in mice ( 5 ).  These associations remained significant even after adjusting for maternal BMI, diet quality, total calorie intake and other risk factors for obesity.  Bottom Line: The study showed that high intake of artificial sweeteners among pregnant women increased their child’s risk of becoming overweight or obese at age one. However, the association was only significant in boys.  Do Artificial Sweeteners Really Cause Weight Gain?  This was the first human study to suggest that maternal consumption of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity in the infant.  A few observational in humans have also suggested that artificial sweeteners may increase the risk of weight gain and metabolic syndrome in adults ( 7 , 8 ).  However, these were all observational studies, meaning that they couldn’t demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship.  Their results have also been inconsistent, with some studies suggesting that artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of obesity ( 9 , 10 ).  Additionally, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that low-calorie sweeteners reduce calorie intake and body weight. This is discussed in a previous research review .  Bottom Line: Human studies haven’t proved that artificial sweeteners promote weight gain. Observational studies have provided inconsistent results.  How Might Artificial Sweeteners Cause Weight Gain?  Researchers have come up with several ideas of how eating artificial sweeteners could affect body weight in adults.  These include:   Changes in glucose metabolism ( 11 ).  Disruption of the gut microbiota ( 12 ).  Dysregulation of appetite control and calorie compensation ( 13 ).   Since artificial sweeteners have been detected in human breast milk, infants may be exposed to sweeteners consumed by their mothers ( 14 ).  Bottom Line: Several theories have been proposed to explain the possible effects of artificial sweeteners on body weight. These involve adverse changes in glucose metabolism or the gut microbiota.  Limitations  The main limitation of this study is its observational design.  Second, the study didn’t distinguish between different types of artificial sweeteners, and didn’t account for the amount found in solid foods.  Third, the researchers assessed the intake of artificial sweeteners using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). Although they are generally good at differentiating between high and low consumers, FFQs are often inaccurate.  Additionally, the questionnaire used in the present study was not specifically validated for beverages.  Finally, infant overweight and obesity were estimated using BMI, which is an inaccurate measure of body fat.  Bottom Line: The study’s main limitation was its observational design. Measures of artificial sweetener intake and body fat were also inaccurate.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study suggests that high intake of artificial sweeteners among pregnant women may increase their children’s risk of excessive weight gain and obesity.  However, since the study had an observational design, it couldn’t prove that artificial sweeteners were responsible for the association.  For this reason, the role of artificial sweeteners in infant weight gain and obesity are still unclear. Randomized controlled trials are needed before any hard conclusions can be reached.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (May 6th–13th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 13, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, May 6th, to Friday, May 13th, 2016. Some of the more interesting topics this week:   Extreme weight loss causes extreme metabolic slowdown.  Can yogurt help you lose weight? The surprising truth.  How breastfeeding is linked to a reduced obesity risk.  Do high-fat dairy products protect against diabetes?  Does dietary cholesterol increase the risk of breast cancer?  Dietary supplements against depression — an evidence-based review.    Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two papers: one about how calorie restriction affects metabolic slowdown, and the other about how yogurt affects weight.   Review:  Extreme Weight Loss Causes Extreme Metabolic Slowdown.  Article:  Persistent metabolic adaptation 6 years after The Biggest Loser competition.  Summary: This study checked in on former contestants of The Biggest Loser TV show, 6 years later. It examined how rapid weight loss affects long-term metabolism.  It found that extreme weight loss caused long-term metabolic slowdown. However, the study did not include a control group, which makes the results difficult to interpret.   Review:  Can Yogurt Help You Lose Weight? The Surprising Truth.  Article:  Is consuming yoghurt associated with weight management outcomes? Results from a systematic review.  Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined how conventional yogurt affects weight, and suggests that it may have modest weight loss benefits.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Infections and Immune Health    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Obesogenic behaviours and depressive symptoms in children: a narrative literature review.  This review concluded that depressive symptoms were linked with behaviors that tend to cause obesity in children.  Specifically, children who were depressed engaged in less physical activity, had a poor diet and spent more time in front of the TV or computer.   Does breastfeeding duration decrease child obesity? An instrumental variables analysis.  This observational study suggests that breastfeeding for a long time may reduce the risk of obesity at age 2. The study found that for every extra week a child was breastfed, the risk of obesity decreased by 0.82%.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Circulating Biomarkers of Dairy Fat and Risk of Incident Diabetes Mellitus Among Men and Women in the United States in Two Large Prospective Cohorts.  Dairy fat contains a few types of fat that are rare in nature. These include pentadecanoic acid, margaric acid and trans-palmitoleic acid.  This observational study found that higher circulating levels of these fats were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The findings suggest that eating a lot of dairy may protect against the development of type 2 diabetes.   Association between serum selenium level and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a non-linear dose–response meta-analysis of observational studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that both low and high levels of selenium are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Conversely, normal levels of selenium were not linked with diabetes.   3. Heart Health  Hypovitaminosis D and orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is what occurs when your blood pressure drops if you suddenly stand up or stretch. It can lead to dizziness, dimmed vision or fainting, and is common among elderly people.  This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that low circulating levels of vitamin D may increase the risk of OH.   Serum zinc concentrations and incident hypertension: new findings from a population-based cohort study.  This observational study indicates that high circulating levels of zinc are associated with a higher risk of high blood pressure in men, increasing the risk of heart disease.   4. Cancer  Systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that dietary cholesterol intake increases risk of breast cancer.  This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that a high dietary intake of cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.   The Western dietary pattern is associated with increased serum concentrations of free estradiol in postmenopausal women: implications for breast cancer prevention.  Estradiol is the main female sex hormone. High levels of estradiol may promote certain types of cancer, mainly breast cancer and endometrial cancer.  This observational study found that the Western diet (especially egg and meat intake) is associated with higher levels of estradiol, possibly increasing breast cancer risk.   5. Appetite and Eating  Believing in food addiction: Helpful or counterproductive for eating behavior?  Food addiction is when people can’t control what they eat and compulsively overeat. It often involves high-fat and/or high-sugar foods, and is associated with obesity.  Many obese individuals believe themselves to be food addicts. This observational study suggests this belief makes people more concerned about their calorie intake. As a result, they tend to eat less, but the long-term effects are unknown.   Association of Picky Eating and Food Neophobia with Weight: A Systematic Review.  Picky eating habits are common in children. Also common is food neophobia, which is when children are unwilling to eat foods they haven’t tried before.  This systematic review of observational studies concluded that food neophobia is not linked with weight status. Conversely, the association of picky eating is unclear, since the definition differed between studies.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Effects of green tea consumption on cognitive dysfunction in an elderly population: a randomized placebo-controlled study.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with 2 grams of green tea powder every day for 12 months did not affect mental function in elderly, Japanese people. However, it did reduce oxidative stress.   Adjunctive Nutraceuticals for Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses.  Some nutrients may improve your response to antidepressant medications. This systematic review suggests that S-adenosylmethionine, methylfolate, omega-3 fats and vitamin D may reduce depressive symptoms when taken with antidepressants.   Infusing pleasure: Mood effects of the consumption of a single cup of tea.  This study suggests that a single cup of tea has no effects on mood, compared to a glass of water.   7. Kidney and Urinary Health  Food Restriction Ameliorates the Development of Polycystic Kidney Disease.  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by cysts that grow on the kidneys. The main symptoms are high blood pressure, abdominal pain, blood in urine and excessive urination. Eventually, it leads to kidney failure.  This mouse study suggests that calorie restriction may slow the progression of PKD.   8. Bone Health  Advanced Glycation Endproducts and Bone Material Strength in Type 2 Diabetes.  Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a group of compounds that form in your body when sugar reacts with protein. High blood sugar levels promote formation.  This observational study suggests that AGEs may be responsible for the bone deterioration and osteoporosis seen in some people with type 2 diabetes.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Acute Garcinia mangostana (mangosteen) supplementation does not alleviate physical fatigue during exercise: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.  Mangosteen is a fruit that mainly grows in Southeast Asia. This randomized controlled trial found that drinking 250 ml of mangosteen juice one hour before exercise did not reduce fatigue during exercise.   Medium-Chain Triglycerides in Combination with Leucine and Vitamin D Increase Muscle Strength and Function in Frail Elderly Adults in a Randomized Controlled Trial.  This was a randomized controlled trial in frail, elderly adults. It showed that taking leucine, vitamin D and medium-chain triglycerides for 3 months improved muscle strength and function more than leucine, vitamin D and long-chain triglycerides.   10. Infections and Immune Health  Nutritional immunology: function of natural killer cells and their modulation by resveratrol for cancer prevention and treatment.  Natural killer cells are your immune system’s first line defence against viral infections and cancer. Growing evidence suggests resveratrol may improve their function.

	Can Yogurt Help You Lose Weight? The Surprising Truth  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 11, 2016  Yogurt is a popular dairy product made by adding live bacteria to milk.  Without added sugar, it is generally considered to be very healthy. Some studies even link yogurt to a reduced risk of weight gain and obesity.  Recently, a team of scientist decided to do a thorough review of all the evidence on yogurt consumption and weight loss/gain.  This article presents a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Conventional yogurt is a type of fermented milk that contains cultures of bacteria, mainly Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii .  Probiotic yogurt contains added probiotic bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus . Yogurt must also contain lactic acid, a minimum of 2.7% milk protein and less than 15% milk fat.  Many studies have examined the effects of conventional yogurt on health, and reviews have concluded that yogurt may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  However, until now, no reviews have examined how yogurt affects body weight.  Article Reviewed  This was a systematic review of studies on the association between conventional yogurt and weight management.  Is consuming yoghurt associated with weight management outcomes? Results from a systematic review.  Study Design  This review and meta-analysis examined the association between conventional yogurt and weight-related outcomes in healthy adults.  It was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines ( 4 ).  The researchers found 22 eligible studies, 13 observational studies, 6 randomized controlled trials and 1 controlled trial.  These studies examined the effects of yogurt in healthy, normal populations, but not in people with obesity or specific diseases.  Additionally, the researchers excluded studies investigating probiotic yogurt, kefir, kumis or yogurt with added vitamins, protein or fat.  Bottom Line: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined how eating conventional yogurt affects weight-related outcomes.  Finding 1: Eating Yogurt is Associated With Lower Body Weight  Observational studies show that eating yogurt is associated with lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat and a smaller waist circumference.  However, observational studies cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship.  It is highly likely that a high consumption of yogurt is associated with other healthy lifestyle factors that could influence body weight.  Bottom Line: Observational studies showed that eating yogurt was linked to lower body weight, BMI, body fat and a smaller waist circumference.  Finding 2: Eating Yogurt Might Reduce Weight  A total of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. Here are brief summaries of 5 of the selected studies.   Compared to the control, yogurt caused more weight loss, body fat reduction and reduction in waist circumference. It also helped retain lean body mass ( 5 ).  Yogurt did not reduce body fat, compared to the control groups ( 6 ).  Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and body fat did not decrease more after consuming yogurt, compared to a placebo ( 7 ).  Eating yogurt did not lead to a greater reduction in body weight, BMI or body fat, compared to a placebo ( 8 ).  Yogurt caused a small, but statistically significant, increase in body weight ( 9 ).   However, this last study was not a weight loss trial and the participants were given one liter of several dairy products ( 9 ).  Also, it should be noted that only one of these studies showed that yogurt caused significant improvements to body weight and composition ( 5 ).  Yet when the results from several of these studies were combined in a meta-analysis, there was evidence that yogurt may have modest weight loss benefits.  Nevertheless, none of these trials could prove that the yogurt itself actually led to changes in body weight.  Bottom Line: Randomized controlled trials have provided mixed results, but together suggest that yogurt may cause modest weight loss.  How Might Yogurt Affect Weight?  The available evidence suggests that yogurt may promote a healthy body weight.  This could be due to a higher protein intake among people who eat a lot of yogurt.  Additionally, some yogurts contain live probiotic bacteria, which may promote weight loss. This is discussed in a previous research review .  However, this review focused on conventional yogurt, not probiotic yogurt.  Bottom Line: Why conventional yogurt would promote weight loss is unclear. However, studies suggest that probiotics may have health benefits.  Limitations  This systematic review was conducted according to strict standards and guidelines. In itself, it doesnât appear to have many limitations.  The main limitations apply to the selected studies. Most of them were observational, but a few randomized controlled trials were also included.  These randomized controlled trials had several limitations. Some didn’t provide all relevant methodology, which made comparing and interpreting the results difficult.  Additionally, only one of the trials reported the type of bacterial strains in the yogurt used. For this reason, it can’t be ruled out that some of them included probiotics.  This also applied to the observational studies. The methods used to estimate yogurt consumption, such as food frequency questionnaires, are often inaccurate.  Finally, the authors concluded that none of the studies they used managed to separate the effects of yogurt, proving that yogurt consumption caused weight loss.  Bottom Line: The studies included in this systematic review had several limitations, and none could prove that eating yogurt led to weight loss.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this systematic review indicates that eating conventional yogurt may have modest weight loss benefits.  However, the evidence was limited, and higher-quality studies are needed before a solid conclusion can be reached. Additionally, if you decide to eat more yogurt to lose weight, selecting sugar-free yogurt is recommended.  And although not the focus of this study, studies suggest that probiotic yogurt may have even greater health benefits.  Tags: Probiotics , Weight loss , Yogurt

	Extreme Weight Loss Causes Extreme Metabolic Slowdown  By Hrefna Palsdottir, MS  |  May 9, 2016  Long-term weight loss is hard to maintain.  Studies show that weight loss reduces the number of calories you burn at rest, resulting in slower weight loss and faster weight regain ( 1 ).  A new study checked in on former contestants of The Biggest Loser TV show, and the findings were recently published in Obesity .   Background  The Biggest Loser is a popular reality TV show. It uses an “eat less, move more” approach to help obese participants lose large amounts of weight.  Participants are encouraged to eat a very-low-calorie diet. They also follow a strict exercise regimen, exercising for several hours a day on most days.  While The Biggest Loser may be an effective way to lose weight, there are some downsides to rapid weight loss using extreme calorie restriction and exercise.  One of them is adaptive thermogenesis, often referred to as metabolic adaptation or starvation mode ( 2 ).  Metabolic adaptation is the brain’s natural, physiological response to reduced calorie intake for long periods of time. In order to maintain energy balance and prevent starvation, the body responds by reducing calorie expenditure.  This is known as metabolic slowdown. And although it’s a well-known phenomenon accepted by scientists, how it works is still unclear.  Article Reviewed  This observational study investigated changes in resting metabolic rate and body composition 6 years after participants lost a large amount of weight.  Persistent metabolic adaptation 6 years after The Biggest Loser competition .  Study Design  This study involved participants from The Biggest Loser competitors in Season 8.  It was a follow-up study to a previous study, which examined whether The Biggest Loser weight loss program helped preserve lean mass and maintain resting metabolic rate ( 3 ).  Out of the 16 participants in the original study, 14 participated in the follow-up that took place 6 years after the weight loss competition ended. This time, the researchers looked into changes in resting metabolic rate and body composition.  For two weeks before the follow-up measurements, body weight was monitored daily.  The participants then stayed at a clinical center for three days. During that time, the researchers measured several factors, including body weight and composition, resting metabolic rate and total energy expenditure.  Blood samples were also collected after an overnight fast, to measure blood sugar, insulin, blood lipids, leptin and several other hormones.  These measurements were then compared to data collected at the beginning and the end of the 30-week competition in 2009.  Bottom Line: This follow-up study examined the changes in resting metabolic rate and body composition 6 years after extreme weight loss.  Finding 1: Contestants Regained a Significant Amount of the Weight They’d Lost  Of the 14 participants who took part in the follow-up study, 13 regained weight within 6 years.  What’s more, four contestants are heavier today than before they took part in The Biggest Loser . Only one contestant weighs less now than 6 years ago.  These findings are shown in the figure below.   However, despite this weight regain, the researchers concluded that compared to other dieting methods the contestants were quite successful at long-term weight loss.  Bottom Line: Most of the contestants regained weight in the years following their extreme weight loss. Only one participant currently weighs less.  Finding 2: Metabolic Adaptation Persists Over Time  Resting metabolic rate (RMR) remained low, as it was 6 years earlier when the competition ended. This is despite substantial weight regain.  That means that to maintain their weight, participants must consume fewer calories.  The average calories burned at rest were around 500 calories lower per day than expected based on current weight and age.   Bottom Line: The contestants had unusually slow metabolisms 6 years after the competition, making long-term weight maintenance difficult.  Limitations  The study had several limitations. First, it did not include a control group of obese people who did not lose weight.  Second, the subjects in this study were obese, which makes the results hard to translate to the general public.  Third, the results are hard to compare to more typical weight loss programs due to the extreme nature of The Biggest Loser .  Lastly, the study was very small, which limits statistical power.  Bottom Line: This study was small, didn’t include a control group and may not apply to non-obese people or those following a less extreme program.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study found that contestants of The Biggest Loser had slow metabolisms for their size 6 years after the show ended.  This made it difficult for them to maintain weight loss, and almost all of the participants had put a significant amount of weight back on.  Unfortunately, there is no known way to completely prevent metabolic slowdown.  However, doing some form of resistance training, like weight lifting, can at least partly reduce muscle loss and metabolic slowdown during weight loss. Eating a high-protein diet may also help ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Tags: Adaptive thermogenesis , Metabolic rate , Weight loss

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 29th–May 6th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 6, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, April 29th, to Friday, May 6th, 2016.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two papers: one on the importance of fiber to the gut microbiota and another about genetic adaptations to a vegetarian diet.   Review:  Low-Fiber Diets Harm the Good Bacteria in Your Gut.  Article:  The Fiber Gap and the Disappearing Gut Microbiome: Implications for Human Nutrition.  Summary: This review briefly discussed how low-fiber diets can reduce the counts of beneficial bacteria in the digestive system. Eating prebiotic fiber regularly may help preserve the good bacteria in your gut.   Review:  Some People May Be Genetically Adapted to Vegetarian Diets.  Article:  Positive Selection on a Regulatory Insertion–Deletion Polymorphism in FADS2 Influences Apparent Endogenous Synthesis of Arachidonic Acid.  Summary: This genetic study showed that a certain gene variant makes it easier for people to produce arachidonic acid from linoleic acid. The variant is found in 18% of North Americans and 68% of Indians. However, the health implications are unclear.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Heart Health  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Lung Health  Digestive Health  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Men’s Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions targeting sleep and their impact on child body mass index, diet, and physical activity.  This systematic review suggests that sufficient sleep may improve the body mass index of children.   Is consuming yoghurt associated with weight management outcomes? Results from a systematic review.  This systematic review concluded that eating yogurt is associated with less weight gain, body fat, waist circumference and body mass index. However, a cause-and-effect relationship couldn’t be determined.   Lower core body temperature and greater body fat are components of a human thrifty phenotype.  Some people have a greater tendency to gain weight than others. This is not necessarily because they eat more — their bodies are simply better at preserving calories. These people are of the thrifty phenotype.  Thrifty individuals have a greater decrease in calorie expenditure during fasting. This study showed that thrifty individuals were more likely to have greater fat mass and belly fat. They also had a lower core body temperature.   Does artificial light-at-night exposure contribute to the worldwide obesity pandemic?  Previous studies indicate that light exposure at night may disrupt the body clock, affecting the daily fluctuations of neurotransmitters and promoting weight gain.  This observational study supports earlier evidence, suggesting that exposure to artificial light at nighttime may contribute to obesity.   2. Heart Health  Effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on blood pressure in adults: an updated meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis concluded that supplementing with vitamin D3 had no effects on blood pressure. However, when the daily dose was greater than 800 IU, blood pressure decreased in those who were 50 years or older.  The researchers also found that vitamin D3 may increase blood pressure when combined with calcium supplements.   Nitrate-Rich Vegetables Increase Plasma Nitrate and Nitrite Concentrations and Lower Blood Pressure in Healthy Adults.  This crossover trial showed that eating nitrate-rich vegetables — beetroot juice, rocket salad drink and a spinach beverage — increased circulating levels of nitrate and lowered blood pressure.   3. Appetite and Eating  Proximity of snacks to beverages increases food consumption in the workplace: A field study.  This field study, conducted at the Google offices, showed that snack consumption was higher when the snacks were placed closer to beverages.  Specifically, when snacks were placed close to beverages the likelihood of snacking increased from 12% to 23% for men and from 13% to 17% for women.   High perceived stress is associated with unfavorable eating behavior in overweight and obese Finns of working age.  This observational study found that self-perceived stress was linked with a higher risk of dysfunctional eating behaviors, such as uncontrolled eating, emotional eating and less intuitive eating.   4. Brain and Mental Health  Evaluation of the effects of iodized salt on the mental development of preschool-aged children: a cluster randomized trial in northern Ethiopia.  This randomized controlled trial examined the mental effects of giving iodized salt to iodine-deficient Ethiopian children who were 4–6 years old.  The study suggests that iodized salt does not affect brain function or mental performance in these children.   5. Lung Health  Dietary Cholesterol Increases the Risk whereas PUFAs Reduce the Risk of Active Tuberculosis in Singapore Chinese.  Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by a certain type of bacteria. It typically affects the lungs and is characterized by a persistent cough, bloody mucus and fever.  This observational study in Chinese men and women suggests that high amounts of dietary cholesterol may increase the risk of active tuberculosis. Marine omega-3 and omega-6 were linked to a reduced risk.   6. Digestive Health  Fermentable Carbohydrate Restriction (Low FODMAP Diet) in Clinical Practice Improves Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a category of inflammatory conditions that affect the digestive tract. These include Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.  This study suggests that a diet low in fermentable carbs, known as FODMAPs , may improve symptoms in people with IBD.   7. Liver Health  Are non-absorbable disaccharides associated with beneficial or harmful effects in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy?  Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease. Some people with cirrhosis may get hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which results in poor brain function. The accumulation of ammonia in blood is believed to play a key role in the development of HE.  Lactulose and lactitol are non-absorbable disaccharides (NAD) that reduce ammonia levels. This Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplementing with NAD may reduce the risk of HE, liver failure and death.   Strong and persistent effect on liver fat with a Paleolithic diet during a two-year intervention.  The Paleolithic diet is based on foods presumed to have been available in the Paleolithic period. These include whole foods such as fruits, berries, seeds, roots, meat and fish.  This randomized controlled trial showed that following the Paleolithic diet for one year decreased liver fat more than a conventional low-fat diet.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Effect of diet-induced weight loss on muscle strength in adults with overweight or obesity – a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.  This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that losing weight by restricting calories may reduce muscle strength. To prevent this, dieting should be accompanied with strength exercises.   9. Men’s Health  Intake of Fruits and Vegetables with Low-to-Moderate Pesticide Residues Is Positively Associated with Semen-Quality Parameters among Young Healthy Men.  This observational study showed that eating fruits and vegetables high in pesticides was associated with decreased sperm counts in young men. This suggests that pesticides in food may reduce fertility.   10. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  In Rwandese Women with Low Iron Status, Iron Absorption from Low-Phytic Acid Beans and Biofortified Beans Is Comparable, but Low-Phytic Acid Beans Cause Adverse Gastrointestinal Symptoms.  Phytate, found in beans, reduces the absorption of iron if eaten during the same meal. This study in Rwandese women showed that eating beans containing low amounts of phytate increased iron availability and reduced iron deficiency.  However, the researchers also found that low-phytate beans caused more digestive side effects, likely caused by higher amounts of phytohaemagglutinin L , a toxic lectin.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Some People May Be Genetically Adapted to Vegetarian Diets  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 4, 2016  Scientists have hypothesized that people who follow plant-based diets for many generations are better adapted to vegan or vegetarian diets.  In other words, some populations may be better at getting the nutrients they need from these diets. Recently, a group of researchers tested this hypothesis.  Here is a summary of their results.   Background  Arachidonic acid is a long-chain, polyunsaturated omega-6 fat. It’s mainly found in animal-derived foods, such as meat, dairy and eggs.  Adequate amounts of arachidonic acid are necessary for normal body function. Yet when arachidonic acid is in short supply, the body can produce it from linoleic acid.  For this reason, vegans can get the arachidonic acid they need from linoleic acid, which is found in high amounts in many vegetable oils.  Although this conversion is usually inefficient, some people may be better at producing arachidonic acid from linoleic acid.  Article Reviewed  Researchers examined whether a variation of the FADS2 gene, which is involved in the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, would result in improved levels.  They also tested the frequency of this gene in different populations.  Positive Selection on a Regulatory InsertionâDeletion Polymorphism in FADS2 Influences Apparent Endogenous Synthesis of Arachidonic Acid.  Study Design  The purpose of this study was to examine whether a variation of the FASDS2 gene resulted in higher arachidonic acid levels.  Additionally, the researchers wanted to find out if the proportion of people with this gene differed between human populations.  The researchers compared two groups of people:   Indians: 234 participants were from Pune, India. About 38% were vegetarian. In this area, people have been largely vegetarian for thousands of years.  North Americans: 311 participants were from the US and Canada. However, most of them came from Kansas.   The researchers also used reference data from the 1,000 Genomes Project. This allowed them to compare a greater number of different populations.  Additionally, the levels of arachidonic acid in red blood cells were analyzed in the 199 participants who came from Kansas.  Bottom Line: This study examined if a variation of the FADS2 gene led to higher levels of arachidonic acid, and if it was more common in traditionally vegetarian populations.  Finding: Some People Are Better at Producing Arachidonic Acid  This study showed some people have a variation of the FADS2 gene (rs66698963) that makes it easier for them to produce arachidonic acid from linoleic acid.  This implies that they are better adapted to a diet that’s very low in arachidonic acid, such as a vegan diet. Additionally, the study found that the percentage of people with this gene variation differed between populations.  Specifically, it was much higher in Indians, and other people in South Asia, compared to North Americans and Europeans. This can be seen in the chart below.   What’s more, the levels of arachidonic acid were, on average, 8% higher among those who had this gene variation, compared to those who didn’t.  Evolutionary tests also revealed that these population differences were unlikely due to chance. In other words, it appears they may be genetic adaptations reflecting traditional, ancestral diets.  Bottom Line: The study found that the gene variant led to higher circulating levels of arachidonic acid. It also showed that it was more common in India and south Asia, compared to North America and Europe.  What Are the Health Implications?  According to some estimates, humans evolved eating omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in the ratio 4:1 to 1:1 ( 1 ).  Today, vegetable oils rich in omega-6 linoleic acid are widely used in cooking and processed foods. These include corn, soybean, cottonseed and sunflower oils.  For this reason, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the Western diet may even reach above 10:1 ( 2 , 3 ).  Some scientists are concerned that a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio may promote inflammation and increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  The authors of the current study speculated that individuals with the rs66698963 gene variation may be at a greater risk of developing inflammation-related, chronic disease when following a diet high in omega-6 linoleic acid and/or arachidonic acid.  For this reason, it is possible that people with this gene variant might be better off sticking to vegetarian diets that do not contain much arachidonic acid and are relatively low in linoleic acid.  Conversely, people without this gene variant should try to get some arachidonic acid from their diet. Strict vegan diets might not suit them.  These are speculations, however, and further studies are needed.  Bottom Line: The health implications of the findings are unclear. The authors speculated that people with the vegetarian gene variant may be better off limiting their intake of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid.  Limitations  This study did not seem to have many limitations, but the health relevance of the results is unclear.  Additionally, the levels of arachidonic acid were only measured in those participants who came from Kansas in the US, but not in the Indian population.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that some people have a certain gene variant that makes them better at converting linoleic acid into arachidonic acid.  This seems to be an adaptation to plant-based diets that contain low levels of arachidonic acid.  Additionally, this gene variant is more common in India and Southeast Asia, compared to North America and Europe.  The health implications are unknown, but the authors speculated that people who have this variant should try to limit their linoleic acid and arachidonic acid intake.

	Low-Fiber Diets Harm the Good Bacteria in Your Gut  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  May 2, 2016  A lack of fiber is one of the main flaws of the modern diet.  Whole plant foods have largely given way to heavily processed products that have lost most of their fiber.  Growing evidence suggests that low-fiber diets may adversely affect the gut microbiota, contributing to the development of many chronic lifestyle diseases.  A recent review discussed the importance of dietary fiber for the beneficial bacteria living in your gut, and how you can preserve a healthy gut microbiota.   Article Reviewed  This review discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy gut microbiota by eating enough fiber.  The Fiber Gap and the Disappearing Gut Microbiome: Implications for Human Nutrition.  What is the Gut Microbiota?  The microbes â bacteria and yeasts â living in your digestive system are collectively known as the gut microbiota or gut flora.  Most of these microbes rely on the things you eat. For example, some thrive on fiber, whereas others multiply when your diet is high in fat and sugar.  Simply put, your dietary choices determine what types of bacteria live in your digestive system. This can have important health implications.  Generally, a diet based on whole, fiber-rich foods promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria, whereas other diets may favor bacteria you would do better without.  Bottom Line: The bacteria in your digestive system are collectively known as the gut microbiota. Their numbers and diversity depend on your diet.  The Importance of a Healthy Gut Microbiota  A healthy gut contains trillions of bacteria. The types of bacteria that are dominant, as well as their quantities, are also important.  For optimal health, your gut should host a variety of beneficial bacteria. Some of their health benefits include:   Colon nutrition: The bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids in your colon, providing nutrition for the cells lining the colon, improving colon health and reducing inflammation ( 1 ).  Stronger gut wall: The bacteria may protect and strengthen the gut wall, preventing harmful substances from entering the blood ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Vitamin K: The bacteria also produce vitamins, such as vitamin K ( 5 ).  Immune system regulation: Animal studies indicate that the gut microbiota provides the immune system with important signals, regulating its function ( 6 ).   An imbalance in the gut microbiota, often referred to as dysbiosis , is when beneficial bacteria are lacking and undesirable bacteria overpopulate the gut.  As discussed in a previous research review , dysbiosis is associated with inflammation, obesity and metabolic diseases.  Bottom Line: Your health may depend on the dominant bacteria in your gut. Some may harm your body, whereas others provide health benefits.  Is the Gut Microbiota Disappearing?  Evidence indicates the modern diet may have led to the loss of beneficial microbes.  The consumption of processed foods has increased, and diets may have become deficient in fiber, at least compared to pre-industrial levels ( 7 ).  This is supported by observational studies comparing the gut microbiota of people living in primitive societies with that of people living in Western countries.  For example, gut microbial diversity is significantly greater in people living in rural communities in Papua New Guinea, South America and Africa, compared to people in the US and Europe ( 8 ).  Furthermore, the average diet of people in Western society is low in fiber. In fact, it’s only half of what is recommended in official guidelines ( 9 ).  Bottom Line: The Western diet contains low amounts of fiber. This may have led to a reduction in the diversity of microbes living in people’s guts.  A Low-Fiber Diet Harms the Gut Microbiota  Multiple factors may affect the gut microbiota. However, the strongest determinant of gut microbial health and diversity is your diet, especially your fiber intake.  Not all fiber is equal. The types of fiber that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria are known as prebiotics or microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) ( 10 ).  Prebiotics are indigestible carbs that pass down into the lower parts of the digestive tract, where they are fermented by the resident bacteria.  A diet deficient in prebiotic fiber reduces the numbers of bacteria that rely on them.  As a result, levels of short-chain fatty acids in the colon decrease, potentially leading to poor colon health and inflammation ( 11 ).  Bottom Line: Fiber intake is very important to gut microbial health. A prolonged low-fiber diet may reduce the numbers of beneficial bacteria.  How to Preserve the Gut Microbiota  The single most important thing you can do to preserve your gut microbiota is to eat enough prebiotic fiber.  Human studies have shown that eating fiber and whole grains increases the diversity of fecal bacteria, which is an indicator of bacterial diversity in the colon ( 12 , 13 ).  Although fiber can be obtained from a variety of whole foods, supplements may be convenient for those who find it hard to get enough from their diet.  Here is a list of a few types of prebiotic fiber:   Beta-glucan: Found in cereals, especially oats and barley ( 14 ).  Galacto-oligosaccharides: A food additive also sold as a supplement ( 15 ).  Guar gum: A food additive widely used in a variety of products ( 16 ).  Inulin: Found in chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes, garlic, onions and asparagus ( 17 ).  Pectin: Found in fruits, such as apples, oranges, plums and bananas ( 18 ).  Resistant starch: Found in whole grains, legumes, green bananas and potatoes ( 19 ).   Bottom Line: Eating enough prebiotic fiber may be a good way to preserve or even restore the gut microbiota.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Evidence indicates the modern lifestyle may have reduced the number of beneficial gut bacteria, potentially contributing to chronic disease.  The low fiber content of the Western diet is partly to blame.  So if you value your health, getting enough prebiotic fiber from whole foods or supplements should be a high priority.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 22nd–29th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 29, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, April 22nd, to Friday, April 29th, 2016.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two studies. One was about the association between antibiotics and weight gain in children, while the other examined how early weight loss predicts later success.   Review:  Antibiotics May Promote Weight Gain In Children.  Article:  Antibiotic use and childhood body mass index trajectory.  Summary: This observational study examined the association between antibiotic use in children and the risk of weight gain and obesity.  The study suggested that taking antibiotics may increase the risk of weight gain throughout childhood and adolescence.   Review:  Early Weight Loss Predicts Long-Term Success.  Article:  Can early weight loss, eating behaviors and socioeconomic factors predict successful weight loss at 12- and 24-months in adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance participating in a randomized controlled trial?  Summary: This observational study examined the association between weight loss success and early weight loss, socioeconomic factors and eating behavior.  It suggested early weight loss predicts weight loss success later on. It also showed that dysfunctional eating, low family income and coming from a broken family makes children less likely to   successfully lose weight.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Lung Health  Digestive Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Pain  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Metabolic Syndrome  Effects of dietary polyphenols on metabolic syndrome features in humans: a systematic review.  Polyphenols are a large group of antioxidants found in most plant-derived foods. A high intake of polyphenol-rich foods has been linked with a variety of health benefits.  This systematic review concluded that a high dietary intake of certain polyphenols may fight components of metabolic syndrome — obesity, poor blood lipid profile, high blood pressure and elevated blood sugar levels.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Fructose acute effects on glucose, insulin, and triglyceride after a solid meal compared with sucralose and sucrose in a randomized crossover study.  This randomized crossover trial examined the effects of fructose on circulating levels of glucose (blood sugar), insulin and triglycerides. For comparison, it also examined the effects of sucralose and sucrose.  The study showed that eating 52 grams of fructose had no effects on triglycerides, compared to 65 grams of sucrose or 0.1 grams of sucralose. However, fructose caused a significantly lower increase in blood sugar and insulin.   3. Heart Health  Associations of serum n-3 and n-6 PUFA and hair mercury with the risk of incident stroke in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD).  Omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, have been linked with a lower risk of heart disease. Oily fish is a major source of EPA and DHA, but may also be high in mercury, which has been associated with a higher risk of heart disease.  This observational study found that levels of mercury in hair and circulating levels of EPA and DHA were not associated with stroke. However, when mercury levels were above the median, EPA and DHA levels were linked with an increased risk of stroke.   Body-Mass Index in 2.3 Million Adolescents and Cardiovascular Death in Adulthood.  This observational study in 2.3 million Israeli adolescents examined the association between body mass index (BMI) and death from heart disease or other causes.  It found that individuals in the 50th to 74th percentiles of BMI, but within the normal range, were at a higher risk of death from heart disease or all causes during the following 40 years. Being overweight or obese was also linked with risk of death.   The effect of drinking water salinity on blood pressure in young adults of coastal Bangladesh.  This observational study of young Bangladeshi adults linked elevated drinking water salinity to high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease. When salinity was above 600 mg/L, blood pressure increased by an average of 3 mmHg.   Sugar-sweetened Carbonated Beverage Consumption and Coronary Artery Calcification in Asymptomatic Men and Women.   Atherosclerosis , characterized by the hardening and narrowing of arteries, is a common cause of heart attacks and strokes.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of sugar-sweetened, carbonated beverages may increase the risk of atherosclerosis.   4. Cancer  G. lucidum (Reishi mushroom) for cancer treatment.  The reishi mushroom has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years, and test-tube studies suggest it may suppress cancer.  This Cochrane review concluded that supplementing with reishi mushroom extract, alongside a conventional cancer therapy, makes people 1.27 times more likely to respond well to therapy. However, it does not have any effects on its own.   5. Brain and Mental Health  Omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementia.  Omega-3 fatty acids are believed to benefit brain function, potentially improving or delaying dementia.  This Cochrane review concluded that supplementing with omega-3 fats for 6 months had no effects on mental health, cognition, everyday functioning or quality of life in people with moderate Alzheimer’s disease.   6. Lung Health  Urinary Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Metabolites and Altered Lung Function in Wuhan, China.  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are dietary contaminants formed in cooked foods, such as meat cooked at high temperatures. The breakdown products (metabolites) of PAHs in the body may promote cancer.  However, this observational study suggests that certain PAH metabolites may impair lung function.   7. Digestive Health  β 2-1 Fructan supplementation alters host immune responses in a manner consistent with increased exposure to microbial components: results from a double-blinded, randomised, cross-over study in healthy adults.  Inulin is a soluble fiber that’s sold as a supplement and naturally found in bananas, artichokes, onions, garlic and more. As a prebiotic fiber, it may promote the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria in the colon.  This randomized crossover study showed that supplementing with 15 grams of inulin per day, for 28 days, increased fecal counts of bifidobacteria and levels of short-chain fatty acids. It also increased the levels of lipopolysaccharides .   A prospective cohort study on the association between coffee drinking and risk of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis.  Acute pancreatitis (AP) is when the pancreas suddenly becomes inflamed. Severe AP is a serious condition with a high risk of death.  This large observational study in Swedish men and women found no significant association between coffee consumption and non-gallstone-related AP.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Intake of Protein Plus Carbohydrate during the First Two Hours after Exhaustive Cycling Improves Performance the following Day.  This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of supplementing with protein and carbs or carbs only on endurance performance in trained cyclists.  Protein and carbs increased endurance the following day, compared to carbs alone.   Compromised Vitamin D Status Negatively Affects Muscular Strength and Power of Collegiate Athletes.  Growing evidence suggests that low levels of vitamin D may impair muscle function.  This observational study is consistent with earlier studies, suggesting that vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency may reduce muscle power.   Ramadan fasting does not adversely affect neuromuscular performances and reaction times in trained karate athletes.  In the Islamic calendar, Ramadan is a month of fasting. It is a type of intermittent fasting characterized by total fasting (no drink or food) from sunrise to sunset.  This study suggests that Ramadan fasting has no adverse effects on muscular function, fatigue or reaction times in elite karate athletes.   9. Pain  Lower Sodium Intake and Risk of Headaches: Results From the Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly.  This randomized controlled trial in 975 elderly people with elevated blood pressure showed that eating less dietary sodium significantly decreased the risk of headaches.   10. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Prevalence of vitamin B-12 insufficiency during pregnancy and its effect on offspring birth weight: a systematic review.  This review of observational studies examined the association between vitamin B-12 deficiency during pregnancy and the child’s birth weight.  It indicates that vitamin B12 deficiency or insufficiency is common during pregnancy, but vitamin B12 levels were not consistently associated with birth weight.   Maternal vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy, fetal growth patterns, and risks of adverse birth outcomes.  This observational study found that pregnant women low in vitamin D had a higher risk of a preterm birth or having children with a low birth weight.   11. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Iron supplementation taken daily for improving health in menstruating women.  This Cochrane review concluded that supplementing with iron for at least 5 days a week may reduce the risk of anemia and iron deficiency in menstruating women.  It may also improve iron stores and exercise performance, while reducing fatigue. Yet supplements may also increase the risk of constipation and abdominal pain.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Early Weight Loss Predicts Long-Term Success  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 27, 2016  Weight loss success during and after a weight loss program varies.  Recently, researchers examined the factors linked to weight loss during and after a 12-month weight loss study in children and adolescents.  Here is a summary of their findings.   Background  Children and adults respond differently to weight loss programs. Some lose a lot of weight, while others lose less.  The ability to keep weight off also varies. Some people quickly regain the weight they lost, while others remain weight-stable or continue losing weight ( 1 , 2 ).  Although genetics play a role in people’s ability to maintain or lose weight, socioeconomic and psychological factors also affect weight loss success.  Defining these factors, identifying their cause and knowing how to treat the underlying problems makes personalized weight loss programs possible.  Furthermore, precisely targeting the root of people’s weight problems would significantly increase long-term success.  This involves providing people with tailor-made weight loss strategies, as well as helping them deal with dysfunctional eating habits.  Article Reviewed  This study examined how early weight loss, socioeconomic factors and dysfunctional eating habits affect long-term weight loss.  Can early weight loss, eating behaviors and socioeconomic factors predict successful weight loss at 12- and 24-months in adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance participating in a randomized controlled trial?  Study Design  This observational study was based on a weight loss trial known as the RESIST study, which examined how two weight loss diets affected insulin sensitivity.  The weight loss strategies included dietary support, exercise and lifestyle advice ( 3 ).  85 overweight or obese children and adolescents, aged 10â17 years, finished the 12-month weight loss program. 42 of them were followed for 12 months afterward, and all of them had pre-diabetes or insulin resistance.  The current analysis examined how early weight loss, socioeconomic factors or eating behaviors affected weight loss during and after the trial.  Change in body weight from the end of the trial (at 12 months) to the follow-up (at 24 months) was calculated using body mass index (BMI), expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile for age groups (BMI95) ( 4 ).  The researchers looked at various factors and examined their association with weight gain or weight loss during the 12-month follow-up.  Socioeconomic data was collected using questionnaires at the start of the trial. Self-reported physical activity, screen time and eating behavior were also assessed.  Bottom Line: This study examined the association between weight loss success, socioeconomic factors, eating behavior and early weight loss.  Finding 1: Early Weight Loss Predicts Long-Term Weight Loss  Of the 85 participants who finished the trial, 79% managed to lose weight.  In comparison, only 55% of the 42 who returned for follow-up lost weight during the first year after the trial ended.  The study showed that those who lost more body weight early on were more likely to continue losing weight during the rest of the trial and after it.  Specifically, weight loss during the first 3 months of the trial was significantly associated with greater weight loss success during the whole trial.  Similarly, greater weight loss during the whole trial was significantly linked with greater weight loss during the year following the trial.  These findings are supported by previous studies showing that early weight loss is significantly associated with later weight loss success and long-term weight maintenance ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Failure to lose weight early may indicate that the weight loss program does not fit the individual and some factors necessary for success are lacking.  Often, this is simply due to lack of commitment or motivation, indicating that additional support may be necessary.  Bottom Line: The study showed that early weight loss during a weight loss program may predict further weight loss success later on.  Finding 2: High Family Income is Linked With Greater Weight Loss Success  The study found that a high family income was associated with greater weight loss during and after the trial.  It also showed that having a highly educated father increased the children’s chances of successfully losing weight.  This is supported by one previous observational study showing that children with poorly educated parents were more likely to fail at losing weight in the long-term ( 10 ).  Several factors may explain this:   Knowledge: Educated parents may know more about healthy nutrition.  Income: Higher education is associated with a higher family income.  Food choice: A low income may reduce the ability or willingness to buy healthy foods, which often tend to be more expensive than junk foods ( 11 , 12 ).   Bottom Line: Family income and parent education were associated with greater weight loss success during and after the weight loss program.  Finding 3: Dysfunctional Eating Habits May Prevent Weight Loss Success  At the start of the trial, the participants’ self-rated eating behavior was assessed using a questionnaire called the Eating Pattern Inventory for Children (EPI-C) ( 9 ).  The EPI-C contained 20 questions, divided into 4 categories:   External eating: The inability to resist certain easily available foods.  Emotional eating: The tendency to eat in response to negative emotions.  Restrained eating: The act of limiting food intake to control body weight.  Parental pressure to eat: Some parents pressure their children into eating.   The study found that self-rated external eating at the start of the study reduced the participants’ chance of successful weight loss.  Parental pressure to eat also reduced weight loss success. Similarly, emotional eating at the start of the study was linked with increased weight loss after the trial.  It is well known that eating disorders and dysfunctional eating habits play a role in the development of obesity in adolescents ( 13 ).  However, some previous studies have found no significant links between emotional or external eating and success during a weight loss program ( 14 , 15 , 16 ).  Bottom Line: External eating, emotional eating and parental pressure to eat reduced long-term weight loss success in the current study.  Finding 4: Parental Break-Up Reduces Long-Term Weight Loss Success  The study also found that individuals who had both parents living at home were more likely to continue losing weight after the trial ended.  Conflict and break-ups cause emotional stress in children, potentially increasing the risk of eating disorders and poor lifestyle habits.  One previous observational study showed that children who came from a broken family were less likely to keep weight off in the long-term ( 10 ).  Bottom Line: Coming from a broken family is a risk factor for weight gain and may reduce success during a weight loss program.  Limitations  This study had several limitations. First, it was observational and could only identify associations, not true causal relationships.  Second, the researchers didn’t measure fat mass directly. Instead, they used body mass index (BMI), which is calculated from height and weight.  BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat and muscle mass, which may have affected the results. Children are also growing, which further complicates things.  However, the researchers took some of these factors into account by expressing BMI as a percentage of the 95th percentile for each gender and age group ( 4 ).  Third, most of those who initially started the trial dropped out. Only 38% of the original participants were followed for 12 months after the trial ended.  This may have caused a further bias, since only those who were the most committed or motivated may have continued participation.  Additionally, eating behaviors and socioeconomic factors were self-reported.  Finally, the study examined only 42 participants, limiting its statistical power. For an observational study, this number is rather small.  Bottom Line: This small observational study used BMI to assess weight loss. BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat and other body components.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study suggests that early weight loss during a weight loss program is a good sign, predicting further weight loss success later on.  It also indicates that low family income, dysfunctional eating habits or broken families may reduce children’s chances of being successful at losing weight in the long-term.

	Antibiotics May Promote Weight Gain In Children  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 25, 2016  In observational studies, antibiotics have been linked to an increased risk of childhood obesity.  Recently, a team of researchers conducted the first large-scale observational study to examine this link across a large age range in healthy children and adolescents.  Below is a detailed summary of their results.   Background  Antibiotics are sometimes added to animal feed to increase growth in livestock ( 1 ).  For this reason, scientists have speculated that antibiotics may have similar effects in humans ( 2 ).  Many observational studies have examined this association in humans. Here are some of their findings from over the years:   2013: Antibiotic use in the first 6 months of life was associated with increased body weight at 10–38 months. Later exposure was not consistently linked ( 3 ).  2014: Repeated use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the first 2 years of life was linked with a greater risk of obesity at 24–59 months of age ( 4 ).  2014: Using antibiotics in the first year of life was linked with an increased risk of being overweight or obese at ages 9 and 12 ( 5 ).  2014: Receiving antibiotics in the first year of life was associated with a slight increase in body mass index in boys aged 5–8 years ( 6 ).  2014: Antibiotics improved weight gain in children with malnutrition ( 7 ).  2015: Antibiotic use within the first 6 months of life was linked with higher body mass in childhood. This was strongest for macrolide antibiotics ( 8 ).  2015: When women received antibiotics in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, their children were at a higher risk of becoming obese ( 9 ).  2016: Receiving antibiotics within the first 6 months of life was not associated with weight gain up to age 7 ( 10 ).   As a possible explanation, studies indicate that antibiotics may imbalance the gut microbiota, affecting metabolism and increasing calorie absorption ( 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ).  Following short-term antibiotic use, the composition of the microbiota may return to normal after a while, but in some cases it takes several years ( 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ).  Article Reviewed  This study examined the association between childhood antibiotic exposure and the risk of weight gain and obesity.  Antibiotic use and childhood body mass index trajectory.  Study Design  This longitudinal observational study examined the association between antibiotics and weight, using the electronic health record data of 163,820 children and adolescents, aged 2–18 years.  It tested three main hypotheses:   Hypothesis 1: Antibiotics have a reversible effect — affecting people’s risk only temporarily, or until the gut microbiota recovers.  Hypothesis 2: Antibiotics have a persistent effect — affecting people’s risk of weight gain or obesity for a long time afterward.  Hypothesis 3: Antibiotics have a progressive effect — influencing children’s weight gain in a way that strengthens over time.   The researchers used mixed-effects linear regression models to calculate the association, while taking other obesity-related factors into account.  Bottom Line: This was an observational study examining the association between antibiotic use and childhood weight gain and obesity.  Finding: Antibiotics Are Linked to Weight Gain  The study showed that antibiotic use in childhood was linked to weight gain.  Specifically, taking antibiotics was associated with an estimated 1.6–3.3 lbs (0.73–1.50 kg) greater body weight at 15 years of age.  Additionally, children who were prescribed antibiotics 12 or more times were 3.5 % heavier when they were 8 years old, compared to the average for that age.  This weight gain was equivalent to 2.4 lbs (1.1 kg).  The study also confirmed all 3 hypotheses — using antibiotics was reversibly, progressively and persistently associated with body mass index (BMI).   Reversible association: Antibiotics’ effects on body weight may weaken with time. Other studies also show that the gut microbiota may recover with time ( 19 ).  Persistent association: The effects of antibiotics may persist for a long time, as supported by previous studies ( 19 , 20 , 21 ).  Progressive association: Associations differed by age. The study suggests that as children get older, antibiotics’ effects on weight gain may become stronger.   When different classes of antibiotics were analyzed separately, macrolides turned out to be the most strongly associated with weight gain at age 15.  Penicillin and cephalosporin were also separately linked with weight gain.  Bottom Line: The study suggests that using antibiotics may increase the risk of weight gain throughout childhood.  Limitations  This study was the largest to examine the association of antibiotic use with obesity, and tried to address many limitations commonly seen in previous studies.  As an observational study, it couldn’t prove that antibiotics caused weight gain, only that taking them was associated with it.  However, given the evidence from animal studies, it seems likely that antibiotics may have a similar effect in humans.  Additionally, the researchers did not have the full antibiotic history of the participants, and only examined a few years of each person’s life (usually 3–5 years).  Data on antibiotic use in the first two years of life — when they may have the strongest effects on weight — was only available for some of the participants ( 4 ).  Finally, the researchers relied on prescriptions for the antibiotic dose and duration. Therefore, they couldn’t be certain all the prescribed antibiotics were actually used.  Bottom Line: This study observed associations, but couldn’t prove a causal relationship. Additionally, the patient history data was incomplete.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study suggests that taking antibiotics may increase the risk of weight gain in children and adolescents.  However, this was an observational study. It doesn’t prove that antibiotics are to blame, only that taking them is linked with weight gain.  Nevertheless, antibiotics are used to increase growth in farm animals, and a similar effect in humans seems plausible.  Tags: Antibiotics , Weight gain

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 15th–22nd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 22, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, April 15th, to Friday, April 22nd, 2016.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two articles: one on the effects of A2 milk on digestive symptoms and another examining the effects of linoleic acid on heart disease risk.   Review:  A2 Milk May Be Safe for Milk-Intolerant People.  Article:  Effects of milk containing only A2 beta casein versus milk containing both A1 and A2 beta casein proteins on gastrointestinal physiology, symptoms of discomfort, and cognitive behavior of people with self-reported intolerance to traditional cow’s milk.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of A2 milk and conventional milk on digestive symptoms, inflammation and mental performance in Chinese adults with self-reported lactose intolerance.  The study showed that while conventional milk causes adverse symptoms for those sensitive to milk, A2 milk appeared to have no adverse effects. However, further studies need to confirm these findings.   Review:  Too Much Linoleic Acid May Increase Heart Disease Risk.  Article:  Re-evaluation of the traditional diet-heart hypothesis: analysis of recovered data from Minnesota Coronary Experiment (1968–73).  Summary: This study analyzed unpublished data from a large randomized controlled trial examining the effects of high linoleic acid intake on cholesterol levels and heart disease. The trial was conducted in the late ’60s and early ’70s.  The main findings were that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid has no benefits for heart health. While it does lower cholesterol, it may still increase the risk of heart disease and death.   New Research From Around the World  A number of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Infections and Immune Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Prebiotics as a modulator of gut microbiota in paediatric obesity.  Prebiotics are a group of fiber that can change the composition of the gut microbiota and stimulate the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Studies indicate that supplementing with prebiotics may help prevent obesity and chronic disease.  This review discusses the role of the gut microbiota in childhood obesity, and the possible benefits of supplementing with prebiotics.   Associations between meal and snack frequency and overweight and abdominal obesity in US children and adolescents from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2012.  This observational study in children indicates that higher eating and snacking frequency may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity. However, meal frequency was not significantly associated with either.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Association between the dietary inflammatory index, waist-to-hip ratio and metabolic syndrome.  The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods are pro-inflammatory, whereas others are anti-inflammatory or neutral.  This observational study suggests that eating foods that promote inflammation, as measured using the DII, does not increase people’s risk of metabolic disease.   3. Heart Health  Prospective Association Between the Dietary Inflammatory Index and Cardiovascular Diseases in the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) Cohort.  This observational study linked foods that promote inflammation, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index, to a higher risk of heart attack.   Middle-Term Dietary Supplementation with Red Yeast Rice Plus Coenzyme Q10 Improves Lipid Pattern, Endothelial Reactivity and Arterial Stiffness in Moderately Hypercholesterolemic Subjects.  This randomized controlled trial in 40 adults with elevated cholesterol levels examined the health benefits of a dietary supplement containing 30 g of coenzyme Q10 and 10 g of monacolins — compounds found in red yeast rice.  The study showed that taking this supplement daily for 6 months reduced LDL-cholesterol by 26% and arterial stiffness by 5%.   4. Cancer  Dietary mineral intake and lung cancer risk: the Rotterdam Study.  This observational study suggests that dietary zinc and iron may reduce the risk of lung cancer. Conversely, dietary calcium, copper, magnesium and selenium were not significantly associated with lung cancer risk.   Dietary pattern and breast cancer risk in Japanese women: the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (JPHC Study).  This observational study in Japanese women found that a Western dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. In contrast, a prudent diet and a traditional Japanese diet were not linked with breast cancer risk.   Vegetarian dietary patterns and the risk of breast cancer in a low-risk population.  This observational study in American women suggests that a vegetarian diet does not decrease the risk of breast cancer, compared to non-vegetarians. However, vegans may be at a lower risk.   5. Appetite and Eating  Differing effects of high-fat or high-carbohydrate meals on food hedonics in overweight and obese individuals.  This study in overweight and obese individuals showed that they liked eating a low-fat, high-carb meal (LFHC) better than a high-fat, low-carb meal (HFLC). Calorie intake was higher during the LFHC meal, and fullness was higher afterward.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Association between serum long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cognitive performance in elderly men and women: The Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.  This observational study found that higher levels of circulating omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids — EPA , DPA and DHA — were linked to better mental performance in elderly people.   Plasma Carotenoids Are Inversely Associated With Dementia Risk in an Elderly French Cohort.  Lutein is an antioxidant found in high amounts in many vegetables, such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, watercress, romaine lettuce, zucchini and Brussels sprouts.  This observational study in elderly people showed that high circulating levels of lutein were linked with a reduced risk of dementia.   Stunting, selenium deficiency and anemia are associated with poor cognitive performance in preschool children from rural Ethiopia.  This observational study in children from rural Ethiopia found that low levels of iron and selenium were linked with poor mental performance.   Food patterns and the prevention of depression.  This review discusses the evidence linking food patterns with mental depression. Studies indicate that diets characterized by lots of seafood, vegetables, fruits and nuts may potentially reduce the risk of depression.   Long-term association between the dietary inflammatory index and cognitive functioning: findings from the SU.VI.MAX study.  This observational study suggests that eating foods that promote inflammation, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index, may impair mental performance.   7. Digestive Health  Psyllium Fiber Reduces Abdominal Pain in Children with Irritable Bowel Syndrome in a Randomized, Double-blind Trial.  Psyllium husk is a type of fiber made from the seed covering of psyllium plants.  This randomized controlled trial in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) showed that supplementing with psyllium husk for 6 weeks reduced the number of abdominal pain episodes.   8. Allergies and Autoimmune Disorders  Soy isoflavone intake is associated with risk of Kawasaki disease.  Kawasaki disease is a rare autoimmune condition, most often seen in Asian children under 5 years of age. It causes inflammation throughout the body, affecting blood vessels, lymph nodes and skin.  This observational study showed that the dietary exposure of soy isoflavones is associated with an increased risk of Kawasaki disease in US children.   9. Infections and Immune Health  Does larch arabinogalactan enhance immune function? A review of mechanistic and clinical trials.  Arabinogalactan is a fermentable fiber found in various plants. Supplemental arabinogalactan is isolated from larch trees, and is known as larch arabinogalactan.  This review discusses the potential of larch arabinogalactan for improving immune function. The authors conclude that arabinogalactan may help fight the common cold, but how this works is unknown.   10. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Omega-3 LCPUFA supplement: a nutritional strategy to prevent maternal and neonatal oxidative stress.  Long-chain, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, are found in fish oil. They are generally considered healthy, but some scientists are concerned they may increase oxidative stress in the body.  This randomized controlled trial in pregnant mothers showed that supplementing with omega-3 from fish oil (400 mg EPA and DHA daily) decreased markers of oxidative stress and increased levels of antioxidants in both the mother and child.   11. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Influence of diet on leukocyte telomere length, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in individuals with varied glucose tolerance: a Chinese population study.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands, protecting them from fusing with neighboring strands. They naturally shorten with age, but oxidative stress may accelerate their shortening, possibly contributing to aging.  This observational study in Chinese adults suggests that elevated blood sugar levels may speed up telomere shortening. Conversely, eating legumes, nuts, fish and seaweed may protect the telomeres.   Nutrition and physical activity for the prevention and treatment of age-related sarcopenia.  Sarcopenia describes the loss of muscle mass that occurs with age. It’s a common cause of poor health, frailty and impaired quality of life among the elderly.  This review discusses the most important dietary considerations in the prevention of sarcopenia: adequate amounts of protein, frequency of protein consumption, sufficient protein quality and strength exercises.

	Too Much Linoleic Acid May Increase Heart Disease Risk  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 20, 2016  It’s been suggested that replacing dietary saturated fat with linoleic acid may reduce the risk of heart disease and early death.  Recently, researchers used unpublished data from the ’60s and ’70s to test this theory. They also conducted a review and meta-analysis of more recent studies.  Here is a detailed summary of their results.   Background  According to the traditional diet-heart hypothesis, reducing circulating cholesterol by eating a diet high in omega-6 linoleic acid — rather than saturated fat — may reduce the risk of heart disease and death ( 1 ).  Pieces of this hypothesis are supported by randomized controlled trials. They showed that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid reduced total circulating cholesterol, including LDL-cholesterol ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Observational studies have also shown that high levels of cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart disease and death ( 5 ).  However, association does not equal causation. And so far, no randomized controlled trials have shown that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid reduces the risk of heart disease events or death.  In fact, evidence points to the opposite — that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid may increase the risk of heart disease events and premature death.  Recently, researchers using previously unpublished data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study (1966–73) showed that replacing saturated fat with vegetable oil, rich in linoleic acid, increased the risk of death from heart disease ( 6 ).  Yet, for decades, one of the main cornerstones of official dietary guidelines has been to reduce saturated fat and replace it with unsaturated fat, such as linoleic acid.  These guidelines may have contributed to the high intake of linoleic acid in the US today. It’s quite high, at about 7% of total calorie intake, on average.  In comparison, linoleic acid intake has been estimated to have been around 2–3% of calories 100 years ago, when people ate minimal amounts of processed foods ( 7 , 8 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers used unpublished data from the Minnesota Coronary Experiment to test the traditional diet-heart hypothesis.  Re-evaluation of the traditional diet-heart hypothesis: analysis of recovered data from Minnesota Coronary Experiment (1968–73).  Study Design  This study was based on the Minnesota Coronary Experiment, a randomized controlled trial conducted from 1968–1973.  It tested whether replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated omega-6 fat, would reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and death.  It’s the largest trial on the health effects of linoleic acid ever conducted, including a total of 9,570 people, aged 20–97. However, the current analysis used data for the 2,355 participants who received the experimental diets for a year or more.  The participants were patients in mental hospitals, but one nursing home was also included. The study length differed between participants, lasting for up to 56 months (4.7 years), depending on how long they were hospitalized.  Participants were randomly assigned to two diets:   Linoleic acid: This diet increased linoleic acid intake (from corn oil) by 280%, from 3.4% to 13.2% of calories, on average. Saturated fat intake was reduced by 50%, from 18.5% to 9.2%, compared to the participants’ initial diets.  Control diet: This diet did not change saturated fat intake, which was 18.5% of calories, on average. The linoleic acid content was increased by 38%, providing about 4.7% of calories.   The saturated fat and linoleic acid content of the two diets is presented below:   In addition to saturated fat, the control group’s diet contained considerable amounts of trans fat from margarine and shortening. The control diet was also 38% higher in linoleic acid, compared to the initial diet.  Using data from the start and end of the study, the researchers analyzed changes in circulating total cholesterol and the incidence of death.  They also used autopsies to detect heart disease. However, the researchers only managed to recover 51% of the 295 autopsy reports.  In addition to analyzing this data, the researchers did a systematic review and meta-analyses of all randomized controlled trials examining the health effects of lowering cholesterol by replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid.  Bottom Line: This study analyzed unpublished data from a large, randomized controlled trial examining how replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid affected cholesterol and the risk of death.  Finding 1: Linoleic Acid Reduced Cholesterol  A high-linoleic acid diet reduced total cholesterol by 13.8% or 31.2 mg/dL, on average. The control diet reduced total cholesterol only by 1% or 5 mg/dL.  When the participants were divided into subgroups based on age and gender, cholesterol reduced similarly within each of them.  Bottom Line: Increasing the dietary intake of linoleic acid significantly reduced the circulating levels of total cholesterol.  Finding 2: Linoleic Acid Did Not Reduce the Risk of Heart Disease  The study found no evidence that a diet high in linoleic acid reduced heart disease risk. In fact, excessive linoleic acid intake seems to have increased heart attacks.  According to autopsy reports, 41% of those who consumed high amounts of linoleic acid had signs of at least one heart attack, while only 22% of the control group did.  However, the incidence of clogged arteries was similar in both groups, and cholesterol reduction was not significantly associated with heart disease.  Additionally, only some of the autopsy reports were recovered in the current analysis.  Bottom Line: The study suggests that higher consumption of linoleic acid increased the risk of heart disease.  Finding 3: Cholesterol Reduction Was Linked With an Increased Risk of Death  The study showed that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid was associated with an increased risk of death.  Specifically, each 30 mg/dL (0.78 mmol/L) reduction in total cholesterol led to a 22% higher risk of dying.  However, when age groups were analyzed separately, the association was only significant among those who were 65 years or older. In this subgroup, the risk of death increased by 35% for each 30 mg/dL reduction in total cholesterol.  In comparison, there was no significant association among those who were younger than 65 years.  In the early 1970s, these results conflicted with prevailing beliefs, probably explaining why the researchers decided not to publish the results.  Bottom Line: A reduction in cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of death.  What Do Observational Studies Say?  Observational studies are useful when randomized controlled trials are impractical or ethically unacceptable.  However, since they cannot identify causal relationships, their interpretation can often be misleading. For example, their findings may sometimes be opposite to the true causal association ( 9 ).  Observational studies have provided inconsistent results for the association of linoleic acid and heart disease.  A few studies showed that self-reported intake of foods high in linoleic acid was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease ( 10 , 11 ).  Other studies found no significant associations ( 12 , 13 ).  Similarly, high circulating levels of linoleic acid have been linked with a lower risk of heart disease in some studies, but not all ( 13 , 14 , 15 ).  Bottom Line: Some observational studies suggest eating a lot of linoleic acid may reduce the risk of heart disease, whereas others found no link.  What Do Randomized Controlled Trials Say?  Randomized controlled trials are the only studies that can demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship.  The systematic review identified only 5 randomized controlled trials that specifically examined the replacement of saturated fat with vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid ( 6 , 16 , 18 , 18 , 21 ).  All in all, these studies included a total of 10,808 participants. Compared to the control groups, a diet rich in linoleic acid reduced total cholesterol by 7.8% to 13.8%, on average.  When the results of these trials were combined in a meta-analysis, there was no evidence of any health benefits from consuming linoleic acid.  Bottom Line: Previous randomized controlled trials haven’t provided any evidence of benefits from increasing the intake of linoleic acid.  Why Doesn’t Linoleic Acid Have Benefits?  Linoleic acid is an essential amino acid that’s healthy in moderate amounts.  Since increasing linoleic acid intake can reduce cholesterol, it may seem paradoxical that it doesn’t reduce the risk of heart disease in randomized controlled trials.  Although it is still not known why linoleic acid may be unhealthy in high amounts, there are a few ideas.  Some scientists believe that a high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the diet may promote systemic inflammation ( 12 ).  Additionally, higher linoleic acid intake increases the levels of oxidized linoleic acid in many body tissues. Oxidized linoleic acid has been associated with several chronic diseases, including heart disease ( 6 , 13 ).  However, high intake might only adversely affect those who have elevated linoleic acid oxidation — smokers, heavy drinkers, heart disease patients or elderly people — while not being as much of a concern for others ( 6 ).  Bottom Line: Why linoleic acid may be unhealthy in high amounts is not entirely clear, but it may increase oxidized linoleic acid levels for some.  Limitations  The Minnesota Coronary Experiment was designed well and is the largest study on the traditional diet-heart hypothesis. However, it also had a few limitations.  First, even though the current study used data from a randomized controlled trial, the findings linking cholesterol levels with death are observational.  Second, the study only measured total cholesterol. Other factors, such as LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, are more closely associated with heart disease.  Third, the experimental diet contained twice as much linoleic acid as the average US diet. Only a small proportion of people reach the high levels examined in this study. It is unclear if lower amounts of linoleic acid have any adverse effects.  Additionally, the study was conducted in mental hospitals and nursing homes. The findings are not necessarily generalizable to healthy people.  Finally, this study and other previous studies have used concentrated vegetable oils high in linoleic acid. The results may not be generalized to nuts or other whole foods containing high amounts of linoleic acid.  Bottom Line: This study was well conducted but had a few limitations. The results may not necessarily be generalized to healthy people, normal intakes of linoleic acid or whole foods that are high in it.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid effectively lowered total cholesterol.  However, despite the significant cholesterol reduction, there was no evidence that linoleic acid reduced the risk of premature death.  The study even suggests that linoleic acid may increase the risk of death from heart disease for those who are 65 years of age or older.  Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid and getting small amounts from the diet is healthy, but consuming too much of it is probably unhealthy. At the very least, replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid provides no health advantage.  If you wish to reduce the linoleic acid content of your diet, avoid vegetable oils high in linoleic acid. These include corn, soybean, sunflower and cottonseed oils.  Tags: Heart disease , Linoleic acid , Saturated fat

	A2 Milk May Be Safe for Milk-Intolerant People  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 18, 2016  Not all cow’s milk is created equally. Its nutritional composition often varies slightly, depending on the cow’s breed, feed or individual genetics.  For example, cow’s milk contains varying amounts of proteins known as A1 and A2 beta-caseins. For some people, A1 beta-caseins might have adverse health effects.  Recently, researchers examined the digestive effects of A1 beta-casein in people with self-reported lactose intolerance. Here is a detailed summary of their results.   Background  Most cow’s milk contains both A1 and A2 beta-casein, but the proportions depend on the cow’s breed. A few years ago, a New Zealand corporation started marketing A2 milk, which contains only A2 beta-casein.  This is because A1 beta-casein has been associated with adverse health conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and heart disease ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Unlike A2 beta-casein, the A1 version releases an opioid peptide known as beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7) during digestion ( 4 , 5 ).  For this reason, A1 beta-casein has been under scrutiny in recent years. However, the evidence is far from conclusive and human studies are lacking ( 6 , 7 ).  There is also evidence suggesting that BCM-7 may cause digestive discomfort — bloating, gas and diarrhea — resembling lactose intolerance.  One trial showed that A1 milk may cause softer stools, compared to A2 milk, and animal studies indicate that A1 beta-casein may significantly increase intestinal inflammation ( 8 , 9 , 10 ).  Article Reviewed  A team of researchers from China and New Zealand compared the effects of A1 and A2 milk on people with self-reported lactose intolerance.  Effects of milk containing only A2 beta casein versus milk containing both A1 and A2 beta casein proteins on gastrointestinal physiology, symptoms of discomfort, and cognitive behavior of people with self-reported intolerance to traditional cow’s milk.  Study Design  This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the health effects of A1 beta-casein and A2 beta-casein on digestive symptoms, inflammation and mental processing.  A total of 45 Chinese adults, with self-reported lactose intolerance, participated in the study. None of them regularly consumed cow’s milk.  At the start of the study, none of the participants consumed milk for two weeks. Afterward, they were assigned to two groups in a random order:   A1 milk group: For two weeks, the participants consumed 8.4 oz (250 ml) of conventional milk after two meals every day. This milk contained 40% A1 beta-casein and 60% A2 beta-casein.  A2 milk group: For two weeks, the participants consumed 8.4 oz (250 ml) of A2 milk after two meals every day. The A2 milk contained only A2 beta-casein.   Both types of milk were provided by the a2 Milk Company in New Zealand. They were identical, apart from differences in the amounts of A1 and A2 beta-casein.  The participants were told not to consume any other dairy products during the study.  The study had a crossover design, which means that all participants were in both groups on separate study periods, separated by a 2-week washout period.  At the start and end of each of the two study periods, the researchers assessed digestive symptoms and collected blood and fecal samples.  Intestinal function was measured at the end of each study period using an electronic smart pill. Additionally, all participants took a Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, crossover trial in Chinese milk-sensitive individuals. It compared the effects of conventional milk and A2 milk on digestive symptoms, inflammation and cognitive function.  Finding 1: A2 Milk Did Not Affect Digestive Symptoms  During lab visits, and at the start, middle and end of each study period, the participants rated their digestive symptoms.  This study suggests that A2 milk doesn’t worsen self-rated digestive symptoms — bloating, flatulence, stomach rumbling and pain — in milk-sensitive individuals.  Conversely, some of the symptoms tended to be worse when conventional milk was consumed.  Although the difference wasn’t significant overall, symptoms were significantly greater compared to the baseline at some of the lab visits.  Since the A2 milk contained the same amount of lactose as the A1 milk, the findings strongly suggest that A1 beta-casein may be responsible for increasing symptoms.  And, even though all of the participants thought they were lactose intolerant, only 51% of them actually turned out to be intolerant to lactose.  Interestingly, lactose-intolerant individuals seemed to be unaffected by the A2 milk. It didn’t significantly worsen symptoms, even though it contained substantial amounts of lactose. The reason for this paradox is unclear.  Bottom Line: Drinking conventional milk tended to worsen digestive symptoms, even in those who weren’t lactose intolerant. These findings suggest that A1 beta-casein may be responsible for digestive discomfort.  Finding 2: A1 Milk Impaired Mental Processing  Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test, which measures the speed and accuracy of mental information processing ( 11 ).  The study found that both cognitive speed and accuracy were slightly lower after drinking the A1 milk for two weeks, compared to the A2 milk.  The authors suggest these changes may be caused by worsened systemic inflammation. Similar effects have been observed in patients with untreated celiac disease ( 12 , 13 ).  Some researchers have also speculated that A1 beta-casein, or its breakdown product BCM-7, may be associated with mental problems ( 14 , 15 ).  This is the first study to show that A1 beta-casein may affect mental processing in healthy people. Further studies need to confirm these findings.  Bottom Line: Drinking conventional milk for 2 weeks slightly impaired mental performance, compared to A2 milk, in milk-sensitive people.  Finding 3: A1 Milk Increased Inflammation  Inflammation in the stomach and small intestines was evaluated by a gastroenterologist using images taken by an electronic smart pill.  This evaluation suggested that small bowel inflammation improved in 36% of the participants when they switched from the A1 milk to the A2 milk.  Similarly, stomach inflammation improved in 23% of the participants. There were also significant differences in inflammatory markers, according to blood tests.  Specifically, levels of the inflammatory markers IL-4, IgG, IgE and IgG1 were higher after 2 weeks of drinking the A1 milk, compared to the A2 milk.  The chart below shows the estimated difference between groups (A1-A2):   These findings are consistent with a few studies in mice showing that A1 beta-casein resulted in greater inflammatory responses in the intestinal tract ( 16 ).  Bottom Line: Drinking conventional milk for 2 weeks appeared to increase inflammation in the digestive tract, compared to A2 milk.  Finding 4: A1 Milk Changed Stool Form and Frequency  The participants rated their stool frequency and consistency every day using the Bristol Stool Chart.  The study showed that drinking the A1 milk increased stool frequency and led to softer stools and diarrhea. Conversely, the A2 milk had no such effects.  These findings are supported by one previous study in humans linking A1 beta-casein with softer stools ( 8 ).  Possibly explaining these findings, the present study found that the A1 milk increased intestinal transit time, as well as intestinal inflammation.  Bottom Line: Drinking conventional milk for 2 weeks softened stools and increased stool frequency, compared to A2 milk.  Finding 5: A2 Milk Increased Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids  Short-chain fatty acids are formed in the colon when beneficial bacteria ferment prebiotic fiber ( 17 ).  They reduce inflammation and are the main source of nutrition for the cells lining the colon, potentially improving colon health ( 18 , 19 , 20 ).  Fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids increased significantly among those who consumed A2 milk for two weeks, while conventional milk caused no changes. These included total short-chain fatty acids, as well as acetate and butyrate.  The estimated difference (A1-A2) in the levels of short-chain fatty acids are presented in the chart below:  The reason why A2 milk increased short-chain fatty acids, and conventional milk did not, is unclear.  Bottom Line: A2 milk increased levels of short-chain fatty acids in the colon, while conventional milk didn’t.  Limitations  This study had several limitations. First, all of the participants had self-reported milk sensitivity, but only half of them turned out to be lactose intolerant.  A1 beta-casein may not have any adverse effects in people who are not lactose intolerant, or otherwise sensitive to milk. Further studies need to confirm these findings in people who are not milk-sensitive.  Second, in the abstract, the researchers claim to have detected elevated circulating levels of BCM-7 after the participants had consumed A1 milk for 2 weeks.  Yet these results are not presented or discussed anywhere in the article.  Finally, one of the main authors and designers of the study was an employee of the a2 Milk Company, which holds the patent for A2 milk. The study was also solely funded by the a2 Milk Company, creating a potential conflict of interest.  Bottom Line: The results of this study may not apply to people who are not milk-sensitive. Although there is no reason to suspect misconduct, the findings should be confirmed by an independent research group.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study found that when milk-intolerant individuals consumed A2 milk for two weeks, they experienced no significant adverse effects.  On the other hand, conventional milk containing both A2 and A1 worsened digestive symptoms. It also increased inflammation, softened stools and slightly impaired mental performance.  Taken together, these findings suggest that milk-intolerant individuals can safely drink A2 milk, without any adverse symptoms.  However, further studies need to confirm the findings.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 8th–15th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 15, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, April 8th, to Friday, April 15th, 2016.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed one article on salt intake and weight gain, and another examining the effects of alternate-day fasting on appetite.   Review:  Eating Salty, High-Fat Food May Promote Weight Gain.  Article:  Salt Promotes Passive Overconsumption of Dietary Fat in Humans.  Summary: This was a randomized, crossover trial examining the effects of salt and fat on food and calorie intake. The study found that salt increased food and calorie intake, regardless of the food’s fat content.   Review:  Alternate-Day Fasting Increases Fullness After Meals.  Article:  Changes in hunger and fullness in relation to gut peptides before and after 8 weeks of alternate day fasting.  Summary: This trial examined the effects of alternate-day fasting (ADF) on ratings of appetite, appetite hormones and body weight.  ADF caused significant weight loss. However, it didn’t seem to increase ratings of appetite after the participants resumed their normal diets.   New Research From Around the World  Every week, dozens of nutrition articles are published. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Digestive Health  Liver Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Inflammation  Thyroid Health  Skin Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Can early weight loss, eating behaviors and socioeconomic factors predict successful weight loss at 12- and 24-months in adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance participating in a randomised controlled trial?  This observational study was based on results from the RESIST study, a randomized controlled, weight-loss trial in adolescents.  The study found that early weight loss is a predictor of long-term weight loss. As a possible explanation, those who lose more weight early on may be more engaged or motivated. They were also better at resisting cravings.   Reduction of the n-6:n-3 long-chain PUFA ratio during pregnancy and lactation on offspring body composition: follow-up results from a randomized controlled trial up to 5 y of age.  A high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, which is typical of the Western diet, has been associated with adverse health effects. Researchers have speculated that this ratio in the diet of pregnant mothers may affect the body composition of their children.  This controlled trial examined the effects of a reduced omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, containing 1,020 mg of omega-3 and 180 mg of omega-6. The study showed that the ratio was not linked with body composition when the children were 2–5 years old.   The timing of the evening meal: how is this associated with weight status in UK children?  This was a cross-sectional observational study in children and adolescents, aged 4–18 years. It found no evidence that eating a meal after 8 p.m. was associated with increased calorie intake, obesity or being overweight.   Impact of low-carbohydrate diet on body composition: meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that following a low-carb diet reduces body weight and fat mass in obese individuals. Very-low-carb diets were especially effective.   Antibiotic use and childhood body mass index trajectory.  This large, observational study in 163,820 children and adolescents, aged 3–18 years, suggests that antibiotic use early in life may increase the risk of weight gain throughout childhood and adolescence.   Tracking of toddler fruit and vegetable preferences to intake and adiposity later in childhood.  This observational study showed that children who liked fruit and vegetables at age 2.5 years were more likely to eat more of them at age 7, compared to those who didn’t like them at age 2.5.  Additionally, higher fruit and vegetable intake at age 7 was linked with slightly lower body mass index.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effects of carnosine supplementation on glucose metabolism: Pilot clinical trial.  Carnosine is an antioxidant dipeptide found in animal-based foods and sold as a supplement. Animal studies suggest these supplements may reduce diabetes risk.  This small, randomized controlled trial in overweight and obese people showed that supplementing with carnosine, 2 grams daily for 3 months, lowered insulin and blood sugar. It also improved insulin sensitivity.   Daily chocolate consumption is inversely associated with insulin resistance and liver enzymes in the Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg study.  This observational study suggests that eating chocolate daily may lower insulin levels and protect against insulin resistance.   3. Heart Health  A combination of omega-3 fatty acids, folic acid and B-group vitamins is superior at lowering homocysteine than omega-3 alone: a meta-analysis.  Elevated levels of homocysteine , which is a product of metabolism, have been associated with a variety of diseases, especially heart disease.  This meta-analysis concluded that supplementing with omega-3, folate, vitamin B6 and B12 is more effective at lowering homocysteine levels than omega-3 alone.   Fresh Fruit Consumption and Major Cardiovascular Disease in China.  This observational study in 512,891 Chinese adults found that eating a lot of fresh fruit is strongly associated with lower blood pressure, lower blood sugar levels and a decreased risk of heart disease.   Long-term magnesium supplementation improves arterial stiffness in overweight and obese adults: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial.  Arterial stiffness is a measure of the blood vessels’ ability to expand or contract. It specifically refers to the arteries, the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart. Increased arterial stiffness is associated with an elevated risk of heart disease.  This randomized controlled trial in 52 obese individuals found that supplementing with magnesium, 350 mg daily for 6 months, reduced a circulating marker (PWVc-F) of arterial stiffness. This suggests that magnesium may reduce the risk heart disease.   Substitutions of red meat, poultry and fish and risk of myocardial infarction.  Myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a heart attack, is when blood flow to the heart, or part of the heart, is disrupted.  This observational study suggests that eating fatty fish, rather than lean fish, poultry or red meat, may reduce the risk of MI. It also found that eating unprocessed red meat rather than processed red meat was not linked with MI.   Evidence for the vitamin D hypothesis: the NHANES III extended mortality follow-up.  Growing evidence indicates that being low in vitamin D is a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases and death. This idea has been called the vitamin D hypothesis. Observational studies have provided mixed results.  This observational study supports the hypothesis. It showed that low levels of vitamin D were linked to an increased risk of heart disease and death from all causes.   4. Cancer  Selenium status and risk of prostate cancer in a Danish population.  This observational study found that circulating levels of selenium were not associated with prostate cancer. However, high levels of selenium were associated with a lower risk of high-grade prostate cancer.   Associations between fruit, vegetable and legume intakes and prostate cancer risk: results from the prospective Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort.  This observational study indicates that eating legumes may protect against prostate cancer. Conversely, it suggests that eating fruit, non-starchy vegetables, potatoes and tomato products does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer.   Heme Iron Intake, Dietary Antioxidant Capacity, and Risk of Colorectal Adenomas in a Large Cohort Study of French Women.  Previous observational studies have linked heme iron from red meat, and nitrosylated heme iron from processed red meat, with an increased risk of colon cancer. This observational study supports previous evidence.   5. Digestive Health  Effects of milk containing only A2 beta casein versus milk containing both A1 and A2 beta casein proteins on gastrointestinal physiology, symptoms of discomfort, and cognitive behavior of people with self-reported intolerance to traditional cows’ milk.  Two types of beta-casein — A1 and A2 — are generally found in milk. Studies have linked A1 beta-casein with adverse health effects, but the evidence is limited. For this reason, milk containing no A1 beta-casein (A2 milk) has started to become available.  This randomized, crossover trial in people with lactose intolerance showed that drinking milk containing A1 beta-casein worsened digestive symptoms, increased inflammation and impaired cognitive speed and accuracy, compared to A2 milk.   6. Liver Health  Effects of Arsenic in Drinking Water on Risk of Hepatitis or Cirrhosis in Persons With and Without Chronic Viral Hepatitis.  In parts of the world, drinking water is contaminated with high amounts of arsenic, which has been associated with a variety of health problems. Arsenic in drinking water can have natural sources, but its levels have been rising due to pollution.  This observational study showed that when the concentration of arsenic in people’s drinking water is 300 μg/L or higher they are at an increased risk of non-viral liver inflammation (hepatitis) and cirrhosis.   7. Bone Health  Fruit and Vegetable Intake and Hip Fracture Incidence in Older Men and Women: The CHANCES Project.  This observational study in older adults suggests that low intake of fruit and vegetables — one serving or less per day — may increase the risk of hip fractures.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  Per meal dose and frequency of protein consumption is associated with lean mass and muscle performance.  Eating adequate amounts of protein may help prevent the loss of muscle mass and strength as you get older. However, some researchers have speculated that the frequency of protein consumption may also play a role.  This observational study in elderly people showed that those who frequently consumed 30–45 grams of protein per meal had greater muscle mass and strength, compared to those who consumed high amounts of protein less often.   Lean body mass change over 6 years is associated with dietary leucine intake in an older Danish population.  Leucine is an essential amino acid, and is the only amino acid known to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. For this reason, adequate leucine intake may reduce the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging.  This prospective observational study supports this. It suggests that greater leucine intake, combined with adequate protein intake, may lessen the loss of muscle mass associated with aging.   Effects of Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Lean Mass, Muscle Strength, and Bone Mineral Density During Weight Loss: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.  This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of taking vitamin D3 supplements during a 12-month weight loss program with regular strength exercises. The subjects were 218 postmenopausal women with inadequate levels of vitamin D.  Supplementing with vitamin D3 — 2,000 IU daily for a year — decreased leg strength, but did not affect changes in lean mass or bone mineral density.   9. Arthritis  Association between overweight and obesity and risk of clinically diagnosed knee, hip, and hand osteoarthritis: A population-based cohort study.  Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints. The main symptoms are joint swelling, stiffness and pain.  This observational study showed that being overweight or obese was linked with an increased risk of hand, hip and knee osteoarthritis.   10. Inflammation  Glutamine in Alleviation of Radiation-Induced Severe Oral Mucositis: A Meta-Analysis.  Mucositis is when the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract become damaged and inflamed as a result of chemo- or radiotherapy for cancer.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that supplementing with glutamine — an amino acid — may reduce mucositis in the mouth.   11. Thyroid Health  The effect of vitamin D on thyroid autoimmunity in non-lactating women with postpartum thyroiditis.  Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed in the first year after pregnancy. It may cause excessive levels of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism) or inadequate levels (hypothyroidism).  This human trial suggests that vitamin D supplements may benefit women with PPT.   12. Skin Health  Dietary glycemic factors, insulin resistance, and adiponectin levels in acne vulgaris.  Acne is a skin disease characterized by greasy skin, blackheads and pimples. It is most common among teenagers. Growing evidence associates acne with dietary factors, such as a high intake of foods that cause spikes in blood sugar levels.  This observational study showed that people with acne had a diet with a higher overall glycemic index and glycemic load, compared to people with healthy skin. Their levels of the hormone adiponectin were also significantly higher.   13. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Mediterranean Diet and telomere length in high cardiovascular risk subjects from the PREDIMED-NAVARRA study.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA at the ends of DNA strands. Their length shortens with age, making them a marker of aging.  This observational study showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which may indicate healthy lifestyle habits, was associated with longer telomeres.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Alternate-Day Fasting Increases Fullness After Meals  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 13, 2016  Alternate-day fasting is a version of intermittent fasting, which is currently one of the world’s most popular weight loss trends.  Recently, a group of scientists examined the effects of 8-week alternate-day fasting on appetite ratings, appetite hormones and body weight.  Here is a detailed summary of their results.   Background  Alternate-day fasting (ADF) is a weight loss technique that has recently become popular ( 1 ).  One popular version of ADF restricts calories by 75% every second day, while allowing unrestricted eating in between.  Human trials have shown that this method may lead to 4–8% weight loss in just 2–3 months. Here is a summary of study results from over the years:   2005: 16 non-obese men and women fasted every other day for 22 days and lost 2.5% of their initial body weight ( 2 ).  2007: 9 overweight asthma patients consumed 20% of their calorie needs every second day for 8 weeks and lost 8% of their initial body weight ( 3 ).  2009: 16 obese people consumed 25% of their calorie needs every second day for 8 weeks and lost 12.4 lbs (5.6 kg) ( 4 ).  2013: 32 obese people fasted every other day for 8 weeks and lost 4.8% of their body weight on a high-fat diet (45% fat), but 4.2% on a low-fat diet (25% fat) ( 5 ).  2013: 32 obese people fasted every other day for 12 weeks and lost 6.6 lbs (3 kg). When fasting and doing endurance exercise, they lost 13.2 lbs (6 kg) ( 6 ).  2013: 15 overweight or obese women fasted every other day for 6 weeks and lost 7% of their initial body weight ( 7 ).   Additionally, giving in to hunger and cravings is the main reason why people fail to adhere to a diet ( 8 ).  This seems to be less common during ADF, though the reason is not clear ( 9 ).  Article Reviewed  This trial examined how ADF affects appetite ratings, appetite hormones and weight.  Changes in hunger and fullness in relation to gut peptides before and after 8 weeks of alternate day fasting.  Study Design  This trial examined the effects of 8-week ADF on subjective ratings of appetite, appetite hormones and body weight.  It should be noted that results from this study have been published before ( 10 ).  A total of 59 middle-aged, obese adults completed the trial, or 80% of those who initially started. 84% of the participants were women.  The study was divided into 3 periods:   Control period 1: For 2 weeks, the participants followed their habitual diets. Initial measurements took place during this period.  Alternate-day fasting: For 8 weeks, the participants fasted every second day.  Control period 2: Immediately after the ADF, participants followed their habitual diet for 2–3 days before final appetite measurements were taken.   Bottom Line: This trial examined how ADF affects appetite and body weight. The study included 59 people, and was divided into three periods.  Alternate-Day Fasting  For 8 weeks, the participants fasted every second day, with 75% calorie restriction. Conversely, on “feed days” they were allowed to eat whatever they wanted.  To improve compliance, all participants were provided with the food they were allowed to eat on fast days.  This food contained 60% of calories from carbs, 24% from fat and 16% from protein. Participants were allowed to consume unlimited amounts of calorie-free drinks.  Every week, the researchers measured body weight. Fat mass, lean mass and intra-abdominal fat were also measured using DXA .  Bottom Line: The participants consumed 25% of their calorie needs every other day for 8 weeks.  Appetite Assessment  Subjective ratings of appetite were assessed after a 12-hour fast, before and after a standardized meal.  The standardized meal consisted of a liquid meal, providing 440 calories. It was designed to have a similar macronutrient profile as a typical breakfast, or 60% of calories from carbs, 24% from fat and 16% from protein.  Fasting blood samples were taken before the meal. Blood was also drawn immediately after the meal, and at 30, 90 and 120 minutes afterwards.  The blood was analyzed for total ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY) and several other hormones. Immediately before each of the blood draws, the participants rated their appetite using a visual analog scale (VAS).  Bottom Line: Appetite hormones and subjective ratings of appetite were assessed before and after the 8 weeks of ADF.  Finding 1: Body Weight Decreased  During eight weeks of ADF, the participants lost 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg).  This weight loss was largely due to loss of fat — 4.9 lbs (2.2 kg) — but also lean mass (water and muscle) — 3.1 lbs (1.4 kg).  The chart below shows the changes in fat mass and lean mass.   Bottom Line: Fasting every other day for 8 weeks led to 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg) weight loss.  Finding 2: Fullness After Meals Increased  Subjective ratings of fullness after the test meal were significantly higher after 8 weeks of ADF, as shown below.   This increase in fullness was associated with higher levels of peptide YY, which is a hormone that reduces appetite after meals ( 11 , 12 ).  Similar to fullness, PYY levels after meals increased after 8 weeks of ADF. The reason why ADF increased PYY levels and fullness is unclear.  Bottom Line: Post-meal fullness was greater after 8 weeks of ADF, compared to before.  Finding 3: Ratings of Hunger Remained Unchanged  Eight weeks of ADF did not change hunger ratings.  This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that hunger remains unchanged after 3–12 weeks of ADF ( 2 , 3 , 9 , 13 ).  Conversely, studies on hunger after continuous calorie restriction indicate that compensatory increases in hunger are common ( 14 , 15 , 16 ).  Taken together, these findings indicate that intermittent calorie restriction is easier to stick to than continuous dieting or fasting.  However, levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin were significantly higher after the test meal at the end of the trial, compared to its levels before the trial.  The reason for these findings is unknown.  Bottom Line: Despite the loss of weight, subjective ratings of hunger didn’t change. This indicates that ADF is easier to adhere to than dieting.  Limitations  This study had a few limitations.  First, meals were not standardized the day before the appetite measurements took place. Even though the tests were preceded by a 12-hour fast, the previous evening’s meal might have affected the findings.  Second, one of the authors, Krista Varady, wrote the book The Every Other Day Diet , creating a conflict of interest. None of the other authors reported competing interests.  Summary and Real-Life Application  ADF is an effective weight loss strategy, causing significant weight loss after 8 weeks. Yet despite the weight loss, hunger ratings after a standardized meal remained unchanged.  Additionally, when the ADF was over and the participants went back on their regular diets, subjective ratings of fullness were significantly higher after the standardized meal, compared to a similar meal before the fast.  These findings suggest that ADF is relatively easy to stick to. However, further studies need to examine its long-term effects.  Tags: Appetite , Fasting , Weight loss

	Eating Salty, High-Fat Food May Promote Weight Gain  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 11, 2016  Regular overeating leads to weight gain, especially when high-fat food is involved.  On its own, fat tastes rather bland and people are unlikely to binge on it. However, mixing it with savory flavors, sugar or salt can make it very tasty.  Recently, a team of scientists examined how fat and salt affect calorie and food intake. Below is a detailed summary of their results.   Background  Most people know that eating too much fat promotes weight gain and obesity ( 1 , 2 ).  This is because, gram for gram, fat is very rich in calories. Additionally, its appetite-suppressing effects are relatively weak ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ).  What’s more, fat is often mixed with salt, which makes it tastier — making people more likely to overeat and become obese ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Article Reviewed  A team of Australian researchers examined the effects of fat and salt on food intake.  Salt Promotes Passive Overconsumption of Dietary Fat in Humans.  Study Design  This randomized, crossover trial examined the effects of fat and salt on food intake.  It also investigated how fat taste sensitivity affects appetite after meals, and whether this was influenced by salt intake.  48 healthy men and women participated in the four test days of the study.  Each day, all participants had a standardized breakfast consisting of plain mini-croissants, after which they were assigned to four lunch meals in a random order.  These lunch meals all consisted of 56% cooked elbow macaroni with 44% Coles home-brand sauce (based on tomato passata ) and a jug of water.  The total amount of macaroni and sauce was 1,350 grams and the participants were allowed eat as much as they wanted, or until they were comfortably full.  Depending on the lunch meal, the sauce provided different amounts of fat and salt, as shown below:   Low-fat, low-salt: 0.02% fat and 0.06% salt — 100% tomato passata.  Low-fat, high-salt: 0.02% fat and 0.5% salt — 100% tomato passata with added salt.  High-fat, low-salt: 34% fat and 0.06% salt — 60% tomato passata with added canola oil (30%) and thickened cream sauce (10%).  High-fat, high-salt: 34% fat and 0.5% salt — 60% tomato passata with added salt, canola oil (30%) and thickened cream sauce (10%).   All four meals contained approximately the same amount of protein and carbs.  The low-salt sauces contained no added salt. The high-salt sauce had optimally pleasant saltiness, based on the results of previous studies ( 9 , 11 , 12 ).  Since the trial had a crossover design, the participants consumed all of the above lunch meals on different occasions, separated by one week.  Before and after each lunch meal, the researchers measured food intake, calorie intake and subjective ratings of appetite.  On two occasions, fat taste sensitivity was also estimated by determining the minimum amount of oleic acid — a common unsaturated fat — the participants were able to taste.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, crossover trial examining the effects of salt and fat on food and calorie intake.  Finding 1: Salt Increased Food and Calorie Intake  Salt increased both food and calorie intake by 11%, regardless of the amount of fat in the meals. These findings are shown in the chart below:   The study also found that salty meals were rated more pleasant than non-salty meals, likely explaining why saltiness caused people to eat more.  Bottom Line: Saltiness increased food and calorie intake by 11%, regardless of the amount of fat. This was probably because salting made the food taste better.  Finding 2: Fat Taste Sensitivity Reduced Fat Intake  Those participants who were sensitive to the taste of fat tended to eat less of it.  However, the study showed that fat intake was only reduced when the lunch meal contained low amounts of salt.  These findings suggest that people who are sensitive to the taste of fat are less likely to overeat on a high-fat diet, but that high amounts of salt may override this reduction in appetite. This is supported by previous studies ( 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 ).  Bottom Line: High fat taste sensitivity was associated with a lower consumption of fat. However, salt seemed to override this reduction.  Finding 3: Fat Affected Food Intake in Women  Overall, fat had no significant effects on the amount of food eaten during the meals.  In other words, despite the high calorie content of fat, the participants did not compensate by eating less of it.  In fact, calorie intake was 60% higher during the high-fat meals.  However, women appeared to be slightly less greedy than men when it came to fat. They ate 15% less of the high-fat meals by weight, compared to the low-fat meals.  Bottom Line: Women ate 15% less of the high-fat meals, compared to the low-fat meals.  Limitations  This study had several limitations.  First, it assessed the effects of only one type of food.  Second, the amount of fat in the high-fat meal was greater than what people normally eat during one meal. However, by using very high-fat meals, the study clearly showed that fat doesn’t have much effect on appetite.  Finally, the study only measured one meal. Further studies need to examine if a high-salt diet has any effects on weight gain and obesity in the long term.  Summary and Real-Life Application  The study showed that salt increased food and calorie intake, regardless of its fat content. This is probably because salt makes food more pleasant or tasty to eat.  Simply put, eating a lot of salty food may promote overeating and weight gain, especially if the food is also high in fat.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (April 1st–8th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 8, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, April 1st, to Friday, April 8th, 2016.   Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two research articles, both published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Review:  Glycotoxins May Impair Insulin Sensitivity.  Article:  Diet low in advanced glycation end products increases insulin sensitivity in healthy overweight individuals: a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial.  Summary: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of a diet low in glycotoxins (advanced glycation end products) on insulin sensitivity.  The study suggested that eating a diet low in glycotoxins may improve insulin sensitivity, potentially reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.   Review:  Pulses May Cause Modest Weight Loss.  Article:  Effects of dietary pulse consumption on body weight: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Summary: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of pulses, the seeds of legumes, on body weight.  The analysis showed that eating pulses may promote a slight weight loss, even if the diet is not calorie-reduced.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Liver Health  Inflammation  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Changes in hunger and fullness in relation to gut peptides before and after 8 weeks of alternate day fasting.  Alternate day fasting (ADF) is a type of intermittent fasting. One version of ADF is characterized by a 75% calorie restriction every second day. This study examined the effects of an 8-week ADF on body weight and appetite ratings in 59 obese people.  On average, their body weight decreased by 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg). Although fasting leptin and insulin decreased, and ghrelin increased, hunger ratings remained unchanged.   Associations between dietary energy density and obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.  Energy density refers to how many calories one gram of a food provides. Energy-dense foods include those that are high in fat and low in water and fiber.  This review and meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that eating energy-dense foods is linked with weight gain and an increased risk of obesity over time.   Free Sugars and Total Fat Are Important Characteristics of a Dietary Pattern Associated with Adiposity across Childhood and Adolescence.  This observational study suggests that a diet high in both fat and sugar is linked with a higher risk of weight gain and obesity among children and adolescents.   Salt Promotes Passive Overconsumption of Dietary Fat in Humans.  This randomized, crossover study showed that using salt to improve the taste of food increased calorie intake during test meals by 11%. This suggests that salting food may promote overeating.  Conversely, there was no effect of fat content on the amount of food eaten. However, a high-fat test meal increased calorie intake by 60%, compared to a lower-fat meal.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Replacing Red Meat and Processed Red Meat for White Meat, Fish, Legumes or Eggs is Associated With Lower Risk of Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome.  Metabolic syndrome is a group of adverse health conditions associated with abdominal obesity. These include elevated blood pressure, poor blood sugar control, high levels of triglycerides and low levels of HDL-cholesterol.  This observational study indicates that eating high amounts of red meat and/or processed red meat makes people more likely to develop metabolic syndrome, compared to eating higher amounts of white meat, fish, legumes and eggs.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effects of Supplementation with Curcumin on Serum Adipokine Concentrations: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  Previous studies suggest that high levels of the hormone adiponectin may protect against insulin resistance in mice. Additionally, evidence suggests that curcumin — an active compound found in turmeric — may increase adiponectin levels.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with metabolic syndrome supports earlier studies, showing that supplementing with curcumin, 1000 mg/day for 8 weeks, significantly increased circulating adiponectin levels, compared to a placebo.   Intake of Total Polyphenols and Some Classes of Polyphenols Is Inversely Associated with Diabetes in Elderly People at High Cardiovascular Disease Risk.  This observational study in elderly people at a high risk of heart disease indicates that eating a lot of foods rich in polyphenol antioxidants, such as whole grains, fruit and vegetables, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.   Protective Effects of the Mediterranean Diet on Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome.  This review of clinical trials and observational studies concluded that adhering to the Mediterranean diet may help prevent metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.   4. Heart Health  Habitual coffee consumption and 24-h blood pressure control in older adults with hypertension.  According to previous studies, coffee or caffeine consumption may increase blood pressure for at least a few hours afterwards, regardless of fasting blood pressure.  This observational study in older Spanish individuals with high blood pressure (hypertension) found that 24-hour blood pressure was higher among those who consumed three or more cups of coffee per day.   Short-Term Vitamin B-6 Restriction Does Not Affect Plasma Concentrations of Hydrogen Sulfide Biomarkers Lanthionine and Homolanthionine in Healthy Men and Women.  Hydrogen sulfide is a type of gas produced in tiny amounts by cells in the lining of blood vessels. It causes the blood vessels to dilate and widen, lowering blood pressure and potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.  This study examined the effects of restricting vitamin B6 intake on markers of hydrogen sulfide levels. Its findings suggest that moderate vitamin B6 deficiency has no effects on hydrogen sulfide levels.   High-Molecular-Weight β-Glucan Decreases Serum Cholesterol Differentially Based on the CYP7A1 rs3808607 Polymorphism in Mildly Hypercholesterolemic Adults.  Beta-glucan (BC) is a cholesterol-lowering, soluble fiber found in cereals and mushrooms. Its ability to lower cholesterol may be related to its viscosity . Certain types of BC, such as high-molecular-weight (HMW) BC are very viscous.  This 5-week, randomized controlled trial in adults with elevated cholesterol levels showed that eating 3 grams of HMW-BC per day reduced cholesterol more than low-molecular-weight (LMW) BC. In fact, LMW-BC had no effects on cholesterol.   5. Cancer  Combined effect of diet and cervical microbiome on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.  Intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) is an abnormal growth on the surface of the cervix in the lower part of the uterus. It’s not cancer, but may develop into cancer if left untreated.  This observational study suggests that a diet characterized by a higher intake of bread, fat and soft drinks  may increase the risk of IN, compared to a higher intake of vegetables and fish. The uterine microbiota also appeared to play a role.   The Dietary Inflammatory Index Is Associated with Prostate Cancer Risk in French Middle-Aged Adults in a Prospective Study.  The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) rates the inflammatory potential of a diet. Some foods may be pro-inflammatory, whereas others may be anti-inflammatory or neutral.  This observational study suggests that pro-inflammatory diets, ranking high on the DII, may increase the risk of prostate cancer. What’s more, they may increase breast cancer risk in those who drink low to moderate amounts of alcohol.   Higher Childhood Red Meat Intake Frequency Is Associated with Earlier Age at Menarche.  Menarche is the first menstrual cycle in girls. It can happen as early as age 9, but is most common between the ages of 11 and 14. Previous studies have linked an early menarche with an increased risk of breast cancer later in life.  This observational study showed that a high intake of red meat is associated with an earlier menarche, while a high intake of fatty fish is linked to a later menarche.   Raw Garlic Consumption and Lung Cancer in a Chinese Population.  This observational study in Chinese people suggests that eating raw garlic may reduce the risk of lung cancer.   Coffee Consumption and the Risk of Colorectal Cancer.  This observational study indicates that drinking coffee regularly may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.   6. Brain and Mental Health  The Omega-3 Index Is Inversely Associated with Depressive Symptoms among Individuals with Elevated Oxidative Stress Biomarkers.  This observational study in Puerto Ricans suggests that a high intake of omega-3 fats may reduce symptoms of depression among those who have high levels of oxidative stress. Others may not benefit as much.   An Increase in Plasma Homovanillic Acid with Cocoa Extract Consumption Is Associated with the Alleviation of Depressive Symptoms in Overweight or Obese Adults on an Energy Restricted Diet in a Randomized Controlled Trial.  This 4-week, randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with 1.4 grams of cocoa extract per day (containing 645 mg of antioxidant polyphenols), did not significantly reduce depression symptoms.  Yet it did increase circulating levels of homovanillic acid , which was associated with reduced depressive symptoms. The relevance of this observation is unclear.   7. Liver Health  Coffee and tea consumption in relation with non-alcoholic fatty liver and metabolic syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver. It is associated with metabolic syndrome. If untreated, it may damage the liver over time, leading to a serious condition known as cirrhosis .  This review and meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that drinking coffee regularly may protect against the development of cirrhosis in NAFLD patients.   8. Inflammation  Supplementation with α-Lipoic Acid Alone or in Combination with Eicosapentaenoic Acid Modulates the Inflammatory Status of Healthy Overweight or Obese Women Consuming an Energy-Restricted Diet.  Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an organosulfur compound found in small amounts in almost all food, especially in organ meats, spinach and broccoli. It is also produced in our bodies where it serves important functions in energy metabolism.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with ALA — 0.3 grams per day while on a 10-week calorie-restricted diet — improved several inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein. It also improved some heart disease markers.   9. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Prepregnancy Low to Moderate Alcohol Intake Is Not Associated with Risk of Spontaneous Abortion or Stillbirth.  This observational study suggests that low or moderate alcohol intake before pregnancy does not increase the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth.   10. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Dietary Protein Requirement of Men >65 Years Old Determined by the Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation Technique Is Higher than the Current Estimated Average Requirement.  For older men, the current estimated average requirement (EAR) for protein is 0.3 g/lb (0.66 g/kg) of body weight per day, while the RDA is 0.363 g/lb (0.8 g/kg). These values were calculated using nitrogen balance data.  Studies using the amino acid oxidation technique (IAAO) indicate that those values may be too low. Confirming their findings, the current study showed that the EAR/RDA for protein among older men may be underestimated by 30%.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Pulses May Cause Modest Weight Loss  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 6, 2016  For weight loss, the importance of real food should not be disregarded.  Previous studies suggest that pulses, the seeds of legumes, may help you lose weight. However, the evidence is not entirely conclusive.  Recently, a team of researchers reviewed and analyzed the available data. Here is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  The seeds of legumes are collectively known as pulses. However, not everyone agrees on what pulses are.  According to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the name pulse only refers to legumes that are harvested for their dry seeds. This definition excludes green beans, green peas, soybeans and peanuts.  Several controlled trials suggest that eating pulses may have benefits for those trying to lose weight. However, their findings are not entirely conclusive ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Factors such as the amount eaten, trial duration, number of participants (statistical power) and the type of pulse examined result in inconclusive findings.  For this reason, combining the results of similar studies in a meta-analysis may increase statistical power, providing more accurate estimates of the truth.  Only one previous meta-analysis examined the effect of pulses on body weight. This meta-analysis, which was published in 2002 and included 8 randomized controlled trials, concluded that pulses do not reduce body weight ( 5 ).  However, many new studies have been published since then, justifying an update.  Article Reviewed  This was a review and analysis of studies examining how pulses affect body weight.  Effects of dietary pulse consumption on body weight: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the effect of pulses on body weight, body fat or weight circumference.  In this study, pulses were defined as all leguminous seeds, except for oilseeds — soybeans and peanuts. These included beans, lentils, chickpeas, dry peas and lupin.  The analysis included 21 trials, including a total of 940 participants. All of the trials had the following characteristics:   They were randomized controlled trials, comparing a diet rich in pulses with a diet that didn’t contain any pulses.  The trials examined the effects of whole pulses on body weight, waist circumference or body fat percentage.  The diets contained the same amount of calories.  They were three or more weeks in duration.   Bottom Line: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of pulses on body weight.  Finding 1: Pulses Reduced Body Weight  This meta-analysis showed that eating pulses may promote modest weight loss in overweight or obese middle-aged men and women.  On average, eating 132 grams of cooked pulses per day (or one serving) led to 0.75 lbs (0.34 kg) greater weight loss over a period of 6 weeks, compared to a diet that didn’t contain any pulses.  Pulses had weight loss benefits even when the diets were not intentionally calorie restricted. This suggests that eating pulses may be an effective alternative to calorie-reduced diets, which may be difficult to stick to in the long-term.  The findings are not supported by a previous meta-analysis, published in 2002 ( 5 ).  However, that analysis only included 8 trials, and may not have had enough statistical power to detect differences as significant.  Bottom Line: The analysis showed that eating pulses may cause modest weight loss, even when diets are not calorie-reduced.  Finding 2: Pulses Did Not Reduce Waist Circumference  Six of the included trials, which had a total of 509 participants, examined the effects of eating pulses on waist circumference.  Overall, eating pulses did not significantly reduce waist circumference.  However, when one study was removed from the analysis ( 6 ), waist circumference decreased by a significant 1%.  Body fat tended to decrease, but the difference between groups was on the verge of being statistically significant.  Bottom Line: Eating pulses did not significantly reduce waist circumference or body fat.  Why Do Pulses Have Weight Loss Benefits?  The main reason why pulses promote weight loss is probably their ability to increase fullness and reduce appetite ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ).  They have several nutritional properties that make them especially satiating or filling. These include:   Soluble fiber: Pulses are rich in soluble fiber, which may slow stomach emptying, contributing to fullness ( 11 ).  Resistant starch: Some of the starch in beans is resistant to digestion. This slightly reduces energy content, benefits gut microbiota and helps with fullness.  Protein: Pulses are high in protein, which also promotes fullness ( 12 ).  Glycemic index: Pulses are low on the glycemic index, improving blood sugar levels. This may potentially prevent overeating ( 13 , 14 ).   Additionally, pulses are affordable and may have a number of other health benefits, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ).  Bottom Line: Pulses may promote weight loss by increasing fullness and calorie intake during a meal.  Limitations  This meta-analysis had several potential limitations.  First, the findings of one trial may have been largely responsible for the significant effects detected ( 4 ).  Second, many of the included trials were of short duration, or only 4–10 weeks. Further studies need to assess the long-term effects of a diet high in pulses.  Third, only 42% of the included trials were considered to be of high quality, according to the Heyland Methodologic Quality Score.  Finally, this meta-analysis did not distinguish between different types of pulses.  Although all pulses have several beneficial properties in common, it is possible that some of them are more effective than others.  Bottom Line: This meta-analysis had a few limitations. Many of the studies included were of low quality and short duration. Additionally, the analysis did not distinguish between the different types of pulses.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This meta-analysis showed that eating pulses may promote a slight weight loss, even on a diet that’s not calorie-reduced.  The ability of pulses to promote fullness and reduce appetite during a meal may be responsible for these effects.  Simply put, if you are trying to lose weight, adding one serving or a cup of cooked  beans, lentils, peas or chickpeas do your daily diet could make a difference.  Tags: Pulses , Weight loss
https://authoritynutrition.com/research/glycotoxins-and-insulin-sensitivity/
	Glycotoxins May Impair Insulin Sensitivity  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 4, 2016  Glycotoxins are a group of compounds that have been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and several other chronic diseases.  Recently, a team of scientists investigated the effects of a diet low in glycotoxins on insulin sensitivity in healthy, overweight people.   Background  Glycotoxins, also known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), are a group of compounds formed when proteins react with sugar.  They are naturally formed in the body, but may be harmful if present in high amounts for a long time ( 1 ).  There are several ways that you may be exposed to high levels of glycotoxins:   Processed food: Many processed foods are high in glycotoxins, especially those that are high in fat ( 2 ).  Cooking: Glycotoxins are formed when foods are cooked, especially with high-temperature dry heat ( 2 ).  Meat intake: Roasted, fried or grilled meat contains high glycotoxin levels ( 2 , 3 ).  Sugar intake: Eating sugar may also increase glycotoxin levels in blood ( 4 ).   Glycotoxins have been associated with many chronic diseases, but few controlled trials have examined their effects in humans.  In mice, long-term consumption of high amounts of glycotoxins impairs insulin sensitivity, promoting the development of type 2 diabetes ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ).  Additionally, several human studies indicate that a diet low in glycotoxins may improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as in healthy, obese individuals without diabetes ( 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers examined the effects of a diet low in glycotoxins on insulin levels and sensitivity.  Diet low in advanced glycation end products increases insulin sensitivity in healthy overweight individuals: a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial.  Study Design  This was a randomized crossover trial examining the effects of a diet low in glycotoxins on insulin levels and sensitivity.  A total of 20 healthy, overweight adults participated in the study. They were assigned to two groups in a random order:   High-glycotoxin diet: For two weeks, the participants adhered to a diet high in glycotoxins, similar to a typical Western diet.  Low-glycotoxin diet: For two weeks, the participants adhered to a diet low in glycotoxins.   Since the trial had a crossover design, all participants were in both groups at different study periods, separated by a 4-week washout period.  All food was provided by the study kitchen. Both diets contained the same amount of calories, and the proportion of calories from protein, fat and carbs were matched. The diets also contained many of the same foods.  At the start and end of each period, the researchers measured fasting insulin and assessed insulin sensitivity, using high-standard techniques.  Additionally, two types of glycotoxins were measured in the diet, blood and urine: N-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and methylglyoxal-derived hydroimadazolidine (MG-H1).  One type of advanced lipoxidation end product (ALE) â N-carboxyethyl lysine (CEL) â was also measured.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, crossover trial examining the effects of a diet low in glycotoxins on insulin sensitivity.  Finding: Eating Less Glycotoxins Improved Insulin Sensitivity  Eating less glycotoxins caused a significant increase in insulin sensitivity, whereas eating higher amounts tended to impair insulin sensitivity.  Specifically, insulin sensitivity increased by 19% in the low-glycotoxin group, and decreased by a non-significant 11% in the high-glycotoxin group.  These results are shown in the chart below.   Several other human trials support these findings. However, they all had several limitations, which weakened their findings ( 9 , 10 , 11 ).  How glycotoxins affect insulin sensitivity is currently unknown, but may be related to their ability to promote oxidative stress and inflammation ( 12 , 13 ).  In the study, there were no significant differences in insulin levels between diets.  Bottom Line: A diet low in glycotoxins significantly improved insulin sensitivity, while insulin levels remained unchanged.  Limitations  This study was designed and implemented well, and used high-standard analytical techniques.  However, the researchers couldn’t rule out that insulin sensitivity might have been affected by factors other than glycotoxins.  Additionally, the study’s results can’t be generalized to people with type 2 diabetes.  Further studies are needed to find out if going on a low-glycotoxin diet improves diabetics’ symptoms.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study suggests that eating a diet low in glycotoxins for two weeks improves insulin sensitivity, compared to a diet high in glycotoxins.  Nonetheless, further studies are needed before the health effects of glycotoxins are fully understood.  Tags: Diabetes , Glycotoxins , Insulin sensitivity

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 25th–April 1st)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  April 1, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, March 25th, to Friday, April 1st, 2016.   Research Reviews  Every week we review and summarize two articles, research papers or scientific reviews. This week, we chose one review from Diabetologia and a research article from the Journal of Nutrition .   Review:  Early Life Gut Microbiota is Affected by Maternal Weight Status.  Article:  Microbial transmission from mothers with obesity or diabetes to infants: an innovative opportunity to interrupt a vicious cycle.  Summary: This scientific review discussed the development of the gut microbiota in early life, the factors affecting it and how it may affect health later in life.   Review:  Vitamin D Supplements May Help Fight Depression.  Article:  Vitamin D Supplementation Affects the Beck Depression Inventory, Insulin Resistance, and Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of vitamin D supplements on symptoms of depression. It suggested that supplements may improve depression symptoms for those who are vitamin D-deficient.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers were published this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Sleep    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Effects of dietary pulse consumption on body weight: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  The seeds of legumes — beans, peas and lentils — are collectively known as pulses. High consumption of pulses has been linked with a variety of health benefits, but their effects on weight loss are unclear.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that eating pulses may be an effective weight loss strategy, even on a diet that is not calorie-restricted.   Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy, early growth, and body fat distribution at school age.  This observational study in pregnant women found that high caffeine intake, equivalent to 6 or more cups of coffee per day, was associated with lower birth weight, compared to caffeine intake equivalent to less than 2 cups per day.  What’s more, the children of mothers who consumed lots of caffeine had a higher body mass index from 6 months of age up to 6 years. They also gained more weight.   DHA supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce BMI or body fat mass in children: follow-up of the DHA to Optimize Mother Infant Outcome randomized controlled trial.  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid abundant in fatty fish, fish oil and certain types of marine algae.  This randomized controlled trial found that intake of DHA-rich fish during the second half of pregnancy does not have any effects on body mass index or fat gain in children when they are 3–5 years old.   Association of breakfast consumption with body mass index and prevalence of overweight/obesity in a nationally-representative survey of Canadian adults.  This observational study in Canadian adults indicates that skipping breakfast is not associated with a higher body mass index.   Unhealthy eating behaviors and weight gain: A prospective study in young and middle-age adults.  This prospective observational study examined the association of several unhealthy eating behaviors with weight gain.  The three eating behaviors that were linked with the most weight gain were: 1) not planning the amount of food to eat, 2) eating at fast-food restaurants and 3) and eating while watching TV.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities, and risk of incident type 2 diabetes in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.  This observational study found that higher circulating levels of omega-6 fats, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid were linked with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.  Conversely, higher levels of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid were associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.   Diet low in advanced glycation end products increases insulin sensitivity in healthy overweight individuals: a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial.  Advanced glycation end product s (AGEs) are a group of compounds that naturally form in our bodies when sugar reacts with protein. High blood sugar levels promote their formation, but AGEs are also found in some processed food products.  This randomized controlled trial showed that a diet low in AGEs increases insulin sensitivity, potentially reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.   Coffee consumption, obesity and type 2 diabetes: a mini-review.  This small scientific review concluded that regularly drinking 3–4 cups of coffee per day may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. These effects are likely due to two active components of coffee: chlorogenic acid and caffeine.   3. Heart Health  Urinary potassium excretion and risk of cardiovascular events.  Previous observational studies indicate that dietary intake of potassium is weakly or modestly associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.  This long-term, prospective observational study examined the amount of potassium in urine, which is a good marker of dietary potassium intake. However, potassium in urine was not independently linked to a reduced risk of heart disease events.   Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet and Incidence of Stroke: Results From 2 Prospective Cohorts.  DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It is a popular diet, designed to reduce blood pressure. This observational study suggests that adhering to the DASH diet may reduce the risk of stroke.   Effect of whey protein on blood lipid profiles: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examined how whey protein affects the blood lipid profile. It lowers triglycerides, but has no effects on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol.   4. Cancer  Calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 modulate genes of immune and inflammatory pathways in the human colon: a human crossover trial.  Previous studies suggest that a high intake of calcium and adequate vitamin D may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. This crossover trial examined the effects of supplementing with vitamin D and calcium while following a typical Western Diet.  The study showed that supplementing with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitD) increased the activity of genes involved with inflammation and immune responses in the colon. However, taking calcium with vitD reversed these effects.   Prospective study of dietary phytoestrogen intake and the risk of colorectal cancer.  Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that resemble the female sex hormone, estrogen, and may have an estrogen-like activity in the body. Some observational studies have linked them with an increased risk of prostate and breast cancer.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of phytoestrogens has no effects on the risk of colorectal cancer.   Association between folate status and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.  Intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) is an abnormal growth on the surface of the cervix in the lower part of the uterus. It’s not cancer, but may develop into cancer if left untreated.  This observational study in Chinese women found that low levels of circulating folate were linked with an increased risk of IN progression.   Plasma equol concentration is not associated with breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions among women in Shanghai, China.  Daidzein is an isoflavone found in soybeans. In some people, intestinal bacteria convert daidzein into equol. High circulating levels of equol have been associated with a number of health benefits.  This observational study in Chinese women suggests that equol has no effects on the risk of breast cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Factors influencing adolescent whole grain intake: A theory-based qualitative study.  One fifth of people in the UK do not eat any whole grains.  This qualitative study found that the main barriers to eating whole grains were difficulties identifying whole-grain food products, bland taste, lack of knowledge on their health benefits and poor availability outside the home.   Factors influencing fruit and vegetable intake among urban Fijians: A qualitative study.  This qualitative study found that the main barriers to eating vegetables and fruits among urban Fijians were increased preferences for processed food and inconsistent availability of high-quality, low-priced, fresh produce.   The importance of taste on dietary choice, behaviour and intake in a group of young adults.  1,306 Australian university students answered a questionnaire assessing their dietary behavior. When it came to food choice, 84% of them rated taste as a very or extremely important factor.  Those who rated taste as highly important had a lower dietary quality, compared to those who considered taste to be less important. For example, they ate much less whole food, but greater amounts of processed junk food.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Association of seasonal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with disability and relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease characterized by speech difficulties, tremors, loss of coordination, impaired memory and other symptoms.  This observational study in MS patients found that vitamin D status was worse in the winter than in the summer. It also suggests that a poor vitamin D status is linked with a more severe MS and more frequent relapses.   7. Digestive Health  Inflammatory potential of diet and risk of ulcerative colitis in a case–control study from Iran.  Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation and small sores (ulcers) in the lining of the colon. The main symptom of an active disease is blood-mixed diarrhea.  This observational study in Iranian adults found that a pro-inflammatory diet, according to the dietary inflammatory index, was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis.   8. Bone Health  Food fortification for bone health in adulthood: a scoping review.  This review concluded that supplementing with calcium and/or vitamin D benefits bone metabolism, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Vitamin D3 supplementation using an oral spray solution resolves deficiency but has no effect on VO2 max in Gaelic footballers: results from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial showed that for Gaelic footballers, taking 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 every day for 3 months did not have any effects on aerobic fitness (as measured by VO2 max ), muscle or lung function.   10. Sleep  Moderately high-dose of the artificial sweetener saccharin potentially induces sleep disorders in mice.  This mouse study suggests that eating saccharin , 0.1% weight/volume for two weeks, disrupts the sleep-wake cycle. Specifically, it reduced wakefulness during the day and impaired sleep quality.

	Vitamin D Supplements May Help Fight Depression  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 30, 2016  Depression affects many people from time to time.  Some evidence indicates that dietary and lifestyle habits may play a role in the development of depression.  Recently, a team of researchers examined how vitamin D supplements affect depressive symptoms. Below is a detailed summary of their results.   Background  Major depressive disorder is a severe form of depression, characterized by strong feelings of sadness and loss of interest in life.  For people with major depressive disorder, these feelings can be so persistent and pervasive that they interfere with activities of daily living ( 1 ).  According to some estimations, major depression affects about 20% of people at some point in their lives ( 2 ).  Although depression is linked with reduced levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, the underlying cause of major depressive disorder is unknown.  Depression has also been associated with elevated oxidative stress and vitamin D deficiency ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Several previous randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of vitamin D supplements on mood and depressive symptoms. Here is a summary of their findings from over the years:   1999: Taking a 100,000-IU dose of vitamin D improved depression in people with seasonal affective disorder ( 8 ).  2008: Supplementing with 20,000 IU or 40,000 IU of vitamin D for one year reduced symptoms of depression in overweight and obese people ( 9 ).  2011: A single dose of 500,000 IU of vitamin D every year for 3–5 years had no significant effects on mood in older women ( 10 ).  2013: Supplementing with 1,500 IU of vitamin D per day for 8 weeks had beneficial effects on depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder ( 11 ).  2014: Supplementing with more than 800 IU of vitamin D per day is somewhat favorable in the treatment of depression, according to a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( 12 ).   Why supplementing with vitamin D may improve depressive symptoms is not entirely clear. Potentially, it may affect levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, reduce inflammation and promote nerve growth ( 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 ).  Article Reviewed  An Iranian research team examined how vitamin D supplements affected major depressive disorder patients’ symptoms.  Vitamin D Supplementation Affects the Beck Depression Inventory, Insulin Resistance, and Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.  Study Design  This 8-week, randomized controlled trial examined how vitamin D supplements affected depression symptoms of patients with major depressive disorder.  A total of 40 Iranian people, 18–65 years old, participated in the trial. The drop-out rate was low, or only 10%.  All participants had moderate depression, according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. They were also deficient in vitamin D, with circulating levels less than 20 µg/L.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Vitamin D: This group took one 50,000-IU vitamin D capsule each week for two months.  Placebo: This group took a placebo capsule, containing no vitamin D.   At the start and end of the study, depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a 21-question self-assessment of depressive symptoms.  The researchers also took blood samples, measuring fasting blood sugar, insulin, blood lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and oxidative stress.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of vitamin D supplements on the symptoms of depression.  Finding 1: Vitamin D Reduced Symptoms of Depression  Vitamin D levels increased by 250% among those who took vitamin D supplements.  Specifically, supplementation increased circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D by 20.4 mg/L, on average. In comparison, vitamin D levels decreased by 0.9 mg/L in the placebo group.  Supplementing with vitamin D did not improve depressive symptoms, according to raw data, although the improvement was on the verge of being statistically significant.  However, after statistically correcting for initial vitamin D levels, age and body mass index (BMI), supplementing with vitamin D improved depressive symptoms by 32%.  The main results are shown in the chart below:   Bottom Line: Supplementing with vitamin D reduced the symptoms of depression. However, the results were only significant after correcting for initial values of vitamin D, BMI and age.  Finding 2: Vitamin D Reduced Insulin Resistance  Supplementing with vitamin D reduced fasting insulin levels by 28%, whereas there was no significant change in the placebo group.  What’s more, the supplements improved insulin resistance by a significant 36%.  The function of the beta-cells — the pancreatic cells that produce and store insulin — appeared to improve significantly as well.  Insulin resistance and beta-cell function were estimated using homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-B), which is based on fasting values for glucose and insulin.  These results can be seen in the chart below:   However, insulin sensitivity, as estimated by quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), did not change in response to vitamin D supplements.  Previous studies have examined how vitamin D affects blood sugar control, but they have provided inconsistent results.  In pregnant women with diabetes, and insulin-resistant Asian women, vitamin D supplements may significantly improve blood sugar control ( 16 , 17 ).  Yet another study found that vitamin D supplements had no effects on insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients ( 18 ).  These inconsistencies might be explained by differences in study populations or study design.  Bottom Line: In the current study, vitamin D supplements reduced insulin levels and improved insulin resistance.  Finding 3: Vitamin D Improved Antioxidant Status  Vitamin D supplements also increased the amount of antioxidants in the blood.  Specifically, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) improved by 7% in the vitamin D group, but only by 3% in the placebo group.  Levels of glutathione — the body’s primary antioxidant — also increased by 24% in the supplement group, as shown in the chart below:   However, these results are not supported by some previous studies.  For example, vitamin D supplements did not affect oxidative stress in pregnant women with diabetes or in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( 16 , 19 ).  The inconsistencies are probably due to differences in study designs and/or participant characteristics.  Additionally, in the present study, supplementing with vitamin D had no effects on the inflammatory marker hs-CRP or blood lipids.  Bottom Line: Vitamin D supplements improved the antioxidant status of the blood, including the levels of glutathione.  Limitations  The findings may not be generalized to all people with depression.  The participants in the current study did not get much sunlight exposure, and all of them were deficient in vitamin D at the start of the study.  It is likely that vitamin D supplements may only benefit those who are deficient.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study suggests that taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D per week, or about 7,000 IU each day, may improve depressive symptoms.  However, all of the participants were initially vitamin D-deficient.  Supplementing is likely ineffective for those who are already getting enough vitamin D, but further studies are needed.

	Early Life Gut Microbiota is Affected by Maternal Weight Status  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 28, 2016  The bacteria that live in our digestive system significantly influence our health in a number of ways.  Commonly known as the gut microbiota, these bacteria can be either beneficial or harmful, all depending on what types of bacteria are present and their relative amounts.  A recent review discussed the development of the gut microbiota early in life, focusing on how it’s influenced by maternal weight status.  Below is a summary of the review’s main points.   Article Reviewed  This was a scientific review on the gut microbiota during infancy and the factors that affect it.  Microbial transmission from mothers with obesity or diabetes to infants: an innovative opportunity to interrupt a vicious cycle.  Early Development of the Gut Microbiota  The gut microbiota is believed to play a key role in the development of many chronic diseases, as discussed in a previous review .  For this reason, maintaining a healthy and balanced microbiota is important for health.  The gut microbiota of infants is highly variable between individuals. It also fluctuates over time, reaching stability at around age two ( 1 , 2 ).  Some evidence suggests that the infant microbiota may influence the gut environment later in life, possibly affecting health ( 3 ).  Bottom Line: Studies suggest that the gut microbiota of infants may affect health later in life.  How Do We Inherit Microbes From Our Mother?  We may inherit microbes from our mother in several ways:   In the uterus: Recent studies suggest that the developing fetus may be colonized by bacteria living in the uterus ( 4 , 5 ).  During birth: The type of birth may have considerable effects on the gut microbiota early in life. Being born the natural way is generally considered more beneficial than being delivered via a cesarean section ( 6 , 7 ).  While breastfeeding: Breastmilk contains bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus . More importantly, it contains prebiotics that support growth of beneficial bacteria ( 8 ).   Bottom Line: Children are colonized by maternal bacteria when they are born and while they are breastfeeding. Recent studies suggest that unborn children may also be colonized by bacteria living inside the uterus.  What Factors Affect the Microbiota in Infants?  Various factors may affect the development of the gut microbiota in young children.  These include type of birth, breastfeeding, maternal health status and metabolism, weight gain during pregnancy, genetics and use of antibiotics.  These are discussed in greater detail below.  Maternal Dietary Intake, Obesity and Diabetes  Our health later in life may be affected by nutrient excess or deficiency while we were still in the womb ( 9 , 10 , 11 ).  In fact, maternal obesity and diabetes are among the strongest risk factors for these metabolic disorders in children ( 12 , 13 ).  What’s more, the newborns of obese or diabetic mothers have higher amounts of liver fat, increasing their risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as they grow older ( 14 , 15 ).  Attempting to explain this, some researchers have speculated that bacterial toxins, “leaking” from the gut into the bloodstream of obese mothers, may affect the development of the fetus ( 16 ).  There is also some evidence that maternal obesity may influence the gut microbiota in early infancy.  For example, bacteria belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria are among the first to dominate the microbiota in young infants.  Although Gammaproteobacteria promote inflammation, they may be necessary for the normal development of the immune system â preventing the risk of autoimmunity in the gut.  A few studies in humans and animals indicate that the levels of Gammaproteobacteria are lower in the offspring of obese mothers ( 17 , 18 ).  Bottom Line : Having an obese and/or diabetic mother is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing these disorders. However, the role of the gut microbiota in this relationship is unclear.  Cesarean Delivery  Children who are born the normal way are colonized by bacteria that live in their mother’s birth canal and intestinal tract.  Conversely, children that are delivered via a cesarean section are initially colonized by bacteria that live on their mother’s skin ( 6 , 7 ).  The way children are born can make its mark on the gut microbiota for up to two years ( 6 , 19 ).  However, observational studies suggest that its health effects may persist for longer.  Being born via a cesarean delivery is associated with a 46% greater risk of obesity at age seven, and a 20% increased risk of type 1 diabetes, compared to children born naturally ( 20 , 21 ).  Bottom Line: Being born via a cesarean section affects the development of the gut microbiota. It has been linked with a higher risk of childhood obesity.  Breastfeeding  Breastmilk contains several compounds that are important for the development of a healthy gut microbiota ( 22 ).  These include human milk oligosaccharides, which function as prebiotic fiber, stimulating the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria ( 8 ).  Human milk is also a source of microbes, mostly Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus , which are also a part of the normal microbiota in healthy infants ( 23 ).  For these reasons, formula-fed infants have a lower diversity of Bifidobacteria in their gut, compared to breastfed infants ( 24 ).  However, not all milk is the same. The breastmilk of obese women seems to be slightly different from that of normal-weight women, containing higher levels of inflammatory markers, insulin and sugar ( 25 , 26 ).  These differences might affect infants’ gut microbiota, but the health relevance is unclear ( 27 ).  Nevertheless, all women are encouraged to breastfeed, regardless of their weight status. Breastmilk has various benefits for young children ( 28 ).  What’s more, several observational studies suggest that breastfeeding may reduce the risk of obesity in children ( 7 , 29 , 30 , 31 ).  Bottom Line: Breastmilk has beneficial effects on the gut microbiota in children, and may even reduce the risk of childhood obesity.  Antibiotics  Some scientists are concerned that using antibiotics may cause an imbalance in the gut microbiota.  Adding to these concerns, several observational studies suggest that using antibiotics during the first two years of life may increase the risk of childhood obesity ( 32 , 33 ).  What’s more, one study found that when mothers were given antibiotics during the second or third trimester of pregnancy their children were 84% more likely to become obese at age seven ( 20 ).  Bottom Line: Using antibiotics may imbalance the gut microbiota, at least temporarily. Some observational studies suggest that taking antibiotics during early infancy may increase the risk of obesity.  Ways to Improve the Gut Microbiota in Infants  In addition to breastfeeding, supplementing with probiotics and prebiotics may lead to significant improvements in the gut microbiota.  Studies in mice and humans show that probiotics and prebiotics may improve the gut microbiota, and reduce body weight and inflammation ( 34 , 35 , 36 ).  Additionally, some studies in pregnant women indicate that supplementing with probiotics may affect the gut microbiota composition of their children ( 37 , 38 , 39 ).  One randomized controlled trial in 122 mothers and their children examined the effects of supplementing with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacter lactis .  The study showed that supplementing from week 36 of pregnancy until delivery increased the counts of beneficial Bifidobacteria in the infants’ gut when they were three months old ( 37 ).  Bottom Line: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life promotes a healthy gut microbiota. After that, supplementing with pro- and prebiotics may provide an added benefit.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, multiple factors affect the development of the gut microbiota in infants.  Being born via a cesarean section, or having an obese or diabetic mother, is linked with an increased risk of an imbalanced gut microbiota and obesity.  Conversely, breastfeeding and taking probiotics is associated with improvements in the gut microbiota and a reduced risk of developing obesity.  Tags: Gut microbiota , pregnancy

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 18th – 25th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 25, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, March 18th, to Friday, March 25th, 2016.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two articles: one from the International Journal of Obesity and the other from the Nutrition Journal .   Review : Gluten Increased Weight Gain in Mice.  Article : Wheat gluten intake increases weight gain and adiposity associated with reduced thermogenesis and energy expenditure in an animal model of obesity.  Summary : This was a controlled experiment examining the effects of a gluten-rich diet on weight gain in mice.  The study showed that feeding the mice with high amounts of gluten caused them to gain more weight, compared to a gluten-free diet. Whether gluten has similar effects in humans is unknown.   Review : Matured Hop Extract May Reduce Belly Fat.  Article : Matured hop extract reduces body fat in healthy overweight humans: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study.  Summary : This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of supplementing with matured hop extract on body weight and belly fat.  The study found that matured hop extract caused a slight loss of belly fat, compared with a placebo.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Liver Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Women’s Health  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Administration of Antibiotics to Children Before Age 2 Years Increases Risk for Childhood Obesity.  For decades, antibiotics have been used to promote weight gain in livestock. It is unclear if they have a similar effect in humans.  This observational study in children showed that three or more courses of antibiotics before the age of two were linked with an increased risk of obesity at age four.   Antibiotic Exposure During the First 6 Months of Life and Weight Gain During Childhood.  Previous animal experiments show that exposure to antibiotics early in life promotes weight gain through its effects on the gut microbiota. Observational studies in humans have provided inconsistent results.  This observational study suggests that taking antibiotics during the first six months of life does not predispose children to weight gain up to age seven.   School breakfast and body mass index: a longitudinal observational study of middle school students.  This observational study in children showed that eating breakfast at school was linked with a lower risk of obesity. The same applied to children who had two breakfasts each weekday.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  The Intestinal Immune System in Obesity and Insulin Resistance.  Growing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota and the intestinal immune system may be involved in the development of metabolic disease, obesity and insulin resistance.  This review discusses the possible links between intestinal immunity, obesity-related insulin resistance and metabolic disease.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Adherence to the DASH and Mediterranean diets is associated with decreased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.  This observational study found that adhering to the DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing diabetes during pregnancy.   Rye-Based Evening Meals Favorably Affected Glucose Regulation and Appetite Variables at the Following Breakfast; A Randomized Controlled Study in Healthy Subjects.  This randomized controlled trial showed that eating whole rye kernel bread late in the evening improved blood sugar control at the following breakfast, compared to eating bread made of white wheat flour.  What’s more, eating whole rye kernel bread reduced subjective appetite ratings, suggesting that it may be useful for those trying to lose weight.   Consumption of dairy foods in relation to impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the Maastricht Study.  This observational study suggests that eating lots of low-fat and fermented dairy products improves blood sugar metabolism.  Additionally, high total dairy intake was linked with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes, whereas high intake of full-fat dairy was linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.   Effect of multi-strain probiotics (multi-strain microbial cell preparation) on glycemic control and other diabetes-related outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in people with type 2 diabetes showed that supplementing with multi-strain probiotics for three months modestly improved fasting insulin and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a marker of blood sugar control.   4. Heart Health  Greater flavonoid intake is associated with improved CVD risk factors in US adults.  Flavonoids are a large group of antioxidants found in virtually all plant-derived foods, especially fresh vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of flavonoid-rich foods improves heart disease risk factors in US adults. These associations were moderate in strength.   5. Cancer  Consumption of Red/Processed Meat and Colorectal Carcinoma: Possible Mechanisms Underlying the Significant Association.   Observational and experimental studies suggest that diets high in red or processed meat are linked with an increased risk of colon cancer.  This scientific review discusses the potential mechanisms underlying these associations.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are associated with poorer cognitive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes: the Maine–Syracuse Longitudinal Study.  This observational study suggests that drinking a lot sugar-sweetened soft drinks may worsen mental performance in people with type 2 diabetes.   Higher dietary diversity is related to better visual and auditory sustained attention.  This observational study in Iranian women indicates that eating lots of different foods, or a high Dietary Diversity Score (according to FAO), is linked with better attention.   7. Liver Health  High serum carotenoids are associated with lower risk for developing elevated serum alanine aminotransferase among Japanese subjects: the Mikkabi cohort study.  This observational study in Japanese adults suggests that high circulating levels of pro-vitamin A carotenoids may help prevent the early development of non-alcoholic liver disease.   Low vitamin D levels and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, evidence for their independent association in men in East China: a cross-sectional study (Survey on Prevalence in East China for Metabolic Diseases and Risk Factors (SPECT-China)).  This observational study in Chinese adults suggests that high circulating levels of vitamin D may protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.   8. Kidney and Urinary Health  The effects of high-dose vitamin E supplementation on biomarkers of kidney injury, inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with diabetic nephropathy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with diabetic kidney disease showed that supplementing with vitamin E, 1200 IU/day for 3 months, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and had positive effects on markers of kidney injury.   Coffee and tea consumption in relation to estimated glomerular filtration rate: results from the population-based longitudinal Doetinchem Cohort Study.  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of how much blood is flowing through the kidneys’ filtering system. It is often used to estimate how well the kidneys are working.  This observational study found that drinking coffee was linked to a slightly elevated GFR. However, the study’s authors concluded that moderate coffee consumption is unlikely to be a concern for kidney health.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Effects of mate tea consumption on muscle strength and oxidative stress markers after eccentric exercise.  Mate tea is a beverage made by steeping yerba mate leaves in water. Yerba mate is a South American plant that is rich in caffeine and antioxidants.  This small, randomized, crossover trial found that drinking mate tea sped up strength recovery after eccentric strength training. It also increased the amount of antioxidants in the bloodstream.   10. Women’s Health  Dietary supplements for pain during menstruation.  This Cochrane review discusses the effectiveness of supplements for treating period pain. Most of the available studies come from Iran, where researchers have examined a variety of herbal medicines and non-herbal supplements.  Limited evidence suggests that fenugreek, ginger, valerian, zataria, zinc sulfate, fish oil and vitamin B1 may reduce period pain. None of the evidence is strong and most of the studies are small and low-quality.   11. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Beta-palmitate – a natural component of human milk in supplemental milk formulas.  This review discusses the health benefits of beta-palmitate in breast milk, and its importance as a constituent of supplemental milk formulas for infants.  Beta-palmitate is a type of fat that may have benefits for fatty acid metabolism, calcium absorption, bone mineral density and stool consistency. Additionally, it promotes the development of a healthy gut microbiota.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Matured Hop Extract May Reduce Belly Fat  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 23, 2016  For those trying to lose weight, weight loss supplements are a popular choice.  When combined with dieting and exercise, supplementing may be useful, but the weight loss benefits are usually modest.  Recently, hops have been studied for their potential weight loss benefits. This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of matured hop extract on weight loss in overweight adults. Below is a detailed summary of its findings.   Background  Hops are a type of flower, widely grown for the brewing industry.  They are an ingredient in most beers, providing the bitter flavor. They also have strong antibacterial properties, which suppress the growth of undesirable bacteria, while favoring the activity of brewer’s yeast ( 1 ).  Apart from their practical application in brewing, studies suggest that some of the active constituents of hops may have health benefits ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  These include iso-alpha-acids — bitter constituents of beer — that are formed from alpha-acids in hops during the brewing process ( 2 , 3 , 5 ).  Evidence indicates that iso-alpha-acids may promote weight loss in humans and mice ( 6 , 7 ).  However, their intense bitterness makes them unsuitable for use in supplements. For this reason, researchers have started investigating less bitter alternatives, such as matured hop extract.  Article Reviewed  Japanese researchers investigated the effects of matured hop extract, containing matured hop bitter acids (MHBAs), on belly fat and body weight.  Matured hop extract reduces body fat in healthy overweight humans: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study.  Study Design  This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of matured hop extract on belly fat and body weight in healthy, overweight Japanese adults.  A total of 200 overweight men and women, aged 20 to 65 years, participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Matured hop extract: Daily for three months, the participants consumed 350 mL of a drink containing matured hop extract (MHE), providing 35 mg of matured hop extract bitter acids (MHBAs).  Placebo: Instead of consuming MHE, the participants consumed 350 mL of a control drink daily for three months.   Both beverages looked and tasted the same. They were based on water, containing around 1.05 grams of carbs and 5.25 grams of fiber (resistant maltodextrin).  At the beginning, midpoint and end of the study, the researchers measured body weight, belly fat (using CT scanning) and total body fat percentage (using bioelectrical impedance analysis).  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of supplementing with matured hop extract on body weight and belly fat.  Finding: Matured Hop Extract Reduced Belly Fat and Body Weight  Total belly fat decreased in both groups, but significantly more so for those who supplemented with matured hop extract, compared to the placebo.  The decrease in abdominal skin fat was not significantly different between groups.  The supplements also led to a slight decrease in body weight and body mass index (BMI). What’s more, the body fat percentage was slightly lower at the end of the study.  The chart below shows the changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage in both groups.   These findings are supported by previous studies examining the health effects of iso-alpha-acids, which are derived from hops during brewing ( 6 , 7 ).  However, this is the first study to show that matured hop extract has a similar benefit.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with matured hop extract significantly reduced belly fat and body weight, compared to a placebo.  How Does Hop Extract Reduce Body Weight?  The reason why matured hop extract stimulates weight loss is not entirely clear.  One study in mice suggests that oxidized alpha-acids (MHBAs) may enhance fat burning in brown fat tissue ( 8 ).  Specifically, the alpha-acids increased heat production ( thermogenesis ) by speeding up the rate at which the mice burned calories in brown fat tissue. Higher activity of brown fat tissue has been associated with a lower body fat content in humans ( 9 ).  However, no alpha-acids were detected in the matured hop extract used in the current study, suggesting that other compounds may be at work.  Simply put, matured hop extract might promote weight loss by activating brown fat tissue, but further studies are needed to fully understand how this works.  Bottom Line: The reason why matured hop extract promotes weight loss is unclear. One previous study suggests that it may increase the amount of calories burned in brown fat tissue.  Why Did Both Groups Lose Belly Fat?  Interestingly, the participants in both groups lost significant amounts of belly fat.  This is a good example of a placebo effect, illustrating why placebo/control groups are necessary for clinical studies.  The psychological effects of participating in a supplemental weight loss study, and expecting certain benefits, may lead to marked improvements in body weight.  Participants may have unconsciously changed their habits — eating, exercise, sleep, smoking and drinking — during the study, even though they were told not to.  The authors speculated that psychological effects or seasonal variation may have been responsible.  It’s also plausible that resistant maltodextrin , a type of fiber added to the beverages, may have contributed to the decrease in belly fat ( 10 ).  Because of the additional weight loss caused by the placebo effect and/or fiber, the actual benefits of the matured hop extract were probably much lower than observed.  Bottom Line: Participants in both groups lost significant amounts of belly fat. The exact cause of the weight loss is unknown, but may be explained by a placebo effect and/or the fiber added to the beverages.  Limitations  According to the authors, the main limitation is the study’s short duration. It’s unclear if the weight loss benefits of matured hop extract are sustained in the long term.  It’s also unclear if the results can be generalized to severely obese individuals or other ethnicities. In the current study, the participants were overweight, with a BMI ranging from 25 to 30.  Finally, nine of the paper’s authors were employees of the study’s sponsor — Kirin Company, a corporation that specializes in beverage production. The same people collected, analyzed and interpreted the data, creating a conflict of interest.  Bottom Line: The findings may not be generalized to obese individuals and the long-term effects are unclear. There was also a conflict of interest.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that supplementing with 35 grams of matured hop extract bitter acids may slightly reduce body fat, especially belly fat.  Why it works is not entirely clear, but previous animal studies suggest it may increase the amount of calories burned in brown fat tissue.  However, before any strong claims can be made, further studies by independent research groups are required.  Tags: Belly fat , Hops , Weight loss

	Gluten Increased Weight Gain in Mice  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 21, 2016  Some people claim that a gluten-free diet may benefit those who wish to lose weight.  However, there are currently no controlled studies in humans to support this.  Recently, a group of researchers examined the effects of gluten on weight gain in mice. Below is a detailed summary of their findings.   Background  Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain types of cereals, such as wheat, barley and rye. It can trigger celiac disease in people who are gluten intolerant.  Gluten is a major component of the typical Western diet, and is found in bread, pastries, pasta and many types of processed foods.  Some researchers are concerned that it may have adverse health effects, even for people who aren’t gluten intolerant. However, this is a matter of debate.  A number of observational studies have examined the effects of a gluten-free diet on body weight among children and adults with celiac disease.  In general, these studies show that a gluten-free diet may increase weight among underweight or normal-weight celiac disease patients. Conversely, it may cause weight loss among those who are overweight or obese ( 1 , 2 ).  However, a proportion of those who are initially overweight or obese may actually gain weight ( 3 , 4 ).  These observational studies cannot prove causation. When people go on a gluten-free diet, changes in body weight are likely caused by dietary factors other than gluten. Improved calorie absorption and digestive health may also play a role.  Scientific reviews have concluded that there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet may promote weight loss in healthy people without celiac disease or gluten intolerance ( 4 , 5 ).  Only one previous study, in mice, has investigated the direct effects of gluten on body weight. It showed that following a high-fat diet, containing 4.3% gluten, caused significantly greater gains in weight and fat, compared to a gluten-free diet ( 6 ).  Article Reviewed  This study in mice investigated the effects of a high-fat and standard diet, containing 4.5% gluten, on body weight.  Wheat gluten intake increases weight gain and adiposity associated with reduced thermogenesis and energy expenditure in an animal model of obesity.  Study Design  This was a controlled study in mice, examining the effects of a high-gluten diet (4.5%) on body weight, and comparing it with a gluten-free diet.  The mice were assigned to one of four diets, which they followed for 8 weeks:   Control-Standard Diet (CD): This was a standard, gluten-free, control diet. The authors did not provide any further information on this diet.  Control-Standard Diet with Gluten (CD-G): This diet contained 4.5% wheat gluten, but was otherwise the same as the CD. The gluten used had been isolated in a laboratory.  High-Fat Diet (HFD): This was a gluten-free, high-fat diet, based on lard. Its composition is unclear, as the authors did not provide any additional information.  High-Fat Diet with Gluten (HFD-G): This diet contained 4.5% wheat gluten, but was otherwise the same as the HFD.   The gluten and gluten-free diets were designed to have a similar calorie density and composition. All of the animals had unlimited access to food.  Every week, the researchers measured the mice’s body weight. Calorie intake was also estimated by calculating the difference of food offered and food consumed.  At the end of the study, the animals’ calorie expenditure was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption. To measure gluten absorption and distribution in the body, some of the mice were given radiolabeled gluten.  Finally, the researchers conducted biochemical analyses on the mice’s blood, fat tissue and liver.  Bottom Line: This study examined the effects of a diet rich in gluten on weight gain in mice, and compared it with a gluten-free diet.  Finding 1: Gluten Caused Greater Weight Gain  The mice who consumed gluten gained around 20% more weight than those who were on a gluten-free diet.  Weight gain was accompanied by significant increases in both skin and abdominal fat. In fact, eating gluten caused about 30% greater fat accumulation.  This effect of gluten was stronger among those who were on the high-fat diet, compared to the standard-control diet, as seen in the chart below:   Despite the greater weight gain in the gluten groups, calorie intake remained similar in the gluten-free groups. These findings are confirmed by one previous study conducted by the same research group ( 6 ).  Bottom Line: Eating gluten led to significantly greater weight gain, compared to a gluten-free diet.  Finding 2: Gluten Reduced Calories Burned  The mice that got 4.5% gluten in their diet tended to burn less calories in the fasting state between meals, compared to those that didn’t eat any gluten.  Specifically, calorie expenditure decreased significantly in the HFD-G group, compared to the HFD, as seen below:   Conversely, in the CD-G group, calorie expenditure decreased modestly, but the change was not significantly different to the CD group.  This metabolic slowdown might explain why eating gluten promoted weight gain ( 6 ).  Analyses of the mice’s fat tissue confirmed these findings. They revealed decreases in the expression of certain proteins — PPARα and PPARγ — which are involved in fat burning ( 7 ).  Bottom Line: The mice who consumed gluten burned less calories, compared to those who were on a gluten-free diet. This may explain why gluten promoted weight gain.  Finding 3: Gluten Was Found in Blood, Fat Tissue and Liver  At the end of the study, the researchers examined the absorption and distribution of gluten in the body by feeding the mice radiolabeled gluten.  They found traces of gluten, or gluten fragments (peptides), in the blood, liver and fat tissue.  Although only tiny amounts of gluten were detected, these findings suggest that gluten, or its peptide fragments, may directly affect the function of these tissues.  In fact, the researchers detected some important changes in certain types of cells in skin fat. For example, they found that levels of UCP1 — a protein that may protect against obesity — were lower in these fat cells.  However, these changes were only significant in the HFD-G group.  Bottom Line: Small amounts of gluten, or its fragments, were detected in the blood, liver and fat tissue. This suggests that gluten may affect these tissues directly.  Limitations  Before any general claims can be made regarding the effects of gluten on body weight, clinical trials in humans need to confirm the findings.  Also, the mice were fed high amounts of gluten, or 4.5% of their diet. The authors didn’t specify whether this percentage referred to the diets’ weight or calorie content.  Since gluten makes up about 6–18% of wheat’s weight, people who base their diet on wheat products might reach similar intake levels.  However, smaller amounts of gluten might not have any clinically relevant effects.  Finally, the researchers added isolated gluten to the mice’s diet. It is unclear if this isolated form of gluten differs from the gluten naturally found in whole wheat.  Bottom Line: This was a mouse experiment and its results cannot be generalized to humans. For this reason, human studies are needed.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this mouse study showed that eating large amounts of gluten may promote weight gain. But whether these findings can be generalized to humans is unknown.  Nevertheless, as general advice, you should not base your diet on a single type of food. If you tend to eat lots of wheat products, expanding your dietary choices may improve your health.  Tags: Gluten , Weight gain

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 11th–18th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 18, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, March 11th, to Friday, March 18th, 2016.   Research Reviews  As usual, we reviewed two articles in the past week: one from the Journal of Nutrition and the other from the International Journal of Obesity .   Review:  Protein Reduces Appetite More Than Carbs and Fat.  Article:  Protein-Enriched Liquid Preloads Varying in Macronutrient Content Modulate Appetite and Appetite-Regulating Hormones in Healthy Adults.  Summary: This randomized crossover trial examined the effects of protein, fat and carbs on self-rated appetite, appetite hormones and calorie intake.  As with most previous studies, the study showed that protein reduces appetite more than carbs and fat. On the other hand, fat appeared to be the least filling.   Review:  Low-Calorie Sweeteners May Help You Lose Weight.  Article:  Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including meta-analyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies.  Summary: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, observational studies and animal experiments that examined the effects of low-calorie sweeteners on calorie intake and body weight.  The overall conclusion was that low-calorie sweeteners do not lead to weight gain. In fact, they may reduce the risk of gaining weight, when replacing sugar.   New Research From Around the World  Every week, we scour the web for new articles on nutrition. Below is a summary of the most interesting  or relevant articles, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Eyes and Vision  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Infections and Immune Health  Skin Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Contaminants  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Matured hop extract reduces body fat in healthy overweight humans: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study.  Hops are a flower that provide beer with its bitterness and flavor. The bitter components include iso-alpha acids , which have been shown to reduce body fat in humans. However, they are quite bitter.  Matured hop extract (MHE) is much less bitter, and could be more suitable as a weight loss supplement. This randomized controlled trial showed that taking MHE, 35 mg of bitter acids for 3 months, significantly reduced body fat, especially belly fat.   Wheat gluten intake increases weight gain and adiposity associated with reduced thermogenesis and energy expenditure in an animal model of obesity.  This study found that adding large amounts of gluten (4.5%) into the diet of mice led to weight gain and fat buildup.  Explaining this, gluten reduced the amount of calories they burned. It’s unclear if these findings have any relevance for humans.   The effect of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on weight and body composition in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.  The DASH diet was designed to lower blood pressure. It also contains a variety of foods that have been linked with a reduced risk of gaining weight.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that following the DASH diet may be an effective way to lose weight. A low-calorie DASH diet led to even more weight loss than other low-calorie diets.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Glucose- and glycaemic factor-lowering effects of probiotics on diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that supplementing with probiotics can significantly improve blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity for people with type 2 diabetes.   3. Heart Health  Impact of phenolic-rich olive leaf extract on blood pressure, plasma lipids and inflammatory markers: a randomised controlled trial.  Antioxidants like phenols may improve risk factors for heart disease. Olive leaves are especially rich in antioxidant phenols, such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol .  This randomized controlled trial in men with pre-hypertension found that supplementing with olive leaf extract — 136 mg of oleuropein and 6 mg of hydroxytyrosol every day for 6 weeks — improved blood pressure and blood lipids.   Effects of vitamin D on serum lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that supplementing with vitamin D may improve circulating levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes.   A meta-analysis of efficacy of Morus alba Linn. to improve blood glucose and lipid profile.  Some previous studies suggest that eating white mulberries may improve blood sugar levels and the blood lipid profile. However, the evidence is inconsistent.  This meta-analysis showed that white mulberries may improve blood sugar levels, but didn’t seem to have any significant benefits for the blood lipid profile.   Protective Effect of Myo-Inositol Hexaphosphate (Phytate) on Abdominal Aortic Calcification in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.  Phytate , found in all plant seeds, is an antinutrient. It reduces the absorption of certain minerals if they are eaten during the same meal. However, it’s also a strong antioxidant with several potential health benefits.  This observational study suggests that adequate intake of phytate may reduce or prevent calcification in abdominal arteries (CAA) in patients with chronic kidney disease. CAA is a risk factor for heart disease.   Heat-treated high-fat diet modifies gut microbiota and metabolic markers in apoe−/− mice.  This study suggests that heated fat may be less healthy than unheated fat. Mice fed a heat-treated, high-fat diet had enlarged spleens and a greater risk of developing heart disease.  Heat-treated fat also caused some changes in the gut microbiota, compared to unheated fat. Advanced glycation end products might be responsible for these effects. However, human studies are needed.   4. Cancer  Body mass index and breast cancer: analysis of a nation-wide population-based prospective cohort study on 1 393 985 Taiwanese women.  This large observational study in Taiwanese women suggests that high body mass index may increase the risk of developing breast cancer after menopause.   Alcohol Consumption-Related Metabolites in Relation to Colorectal Cancer and Adenoma: Two Case-Control Studies Using Serum Biomarkers.  This observational study found no significant association between circulating markers of alcohol consumption and colorectal cancer .   5. Appetite and Eating  Poverty, inequality, and increased consumption of high calorie food: Experimental evidence for a causal link.  This experiment suggests that when people view themselves as poor, or underprivileged, they are more likely to eat more and gain weight. The feeling of inequality may lead to anxiety, which can increase calorie intake.   Emotional eating as a mediator between depression and weight gain.  Observational studies indicate that depressed people are more likely to gain weight. This study indicates that depressed mothers are prone to emotional eating, or seeking relief from anxiety by eating.  This emotional eating may explain why depressed people have an increased risk of weight gain.  However, the current study detected no significant links between depression and weight gain.   Is desire to eat in response to positive emotions an ‘obese’ eating style: Is Kummerspeck for some people a misnomer?  This experiment suggests that obese women do not eat in response to positive emotions. Only negative emotions seem to trigger eating.  This response to negative emotions is known as emotional eating, and is believed to explain, at least partly, why some people are prone to gaining weight.   Listening to music can influence hedonic and sensory perceptions of gelati.  This study suggests that music may influence the perceived taste of food. For example, when people liked a piece of music, or regarded it as neutral, the sweetness of chocolate ice cream was rated higher.  Conversely, if people listened to a piece of music they disliked, the ice cream was considered to be more bitter in taste.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Low dose resveratrol improves cerebrovascular function in type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Resveratrol is an antioxidant found in plant foods, such as the skin of red grapes and blueberries. It is best known for being found in red wine, and is believed to be responsible for some of its health benefits. However, the evidence is limited.  This randomized crossover trial in people with type 2 diabetes showed that taking a single dose of resveratrol temporarily improved blood flow in the brain. Maximum improvement was seen at the lowest dose tested, or 75 mg.   7. Eyes and Vision  Dietary folate, B vitamins, genetic susceptibility and progression to advanced nonexudative age-related macular degeneration with geographic atrophy: a prospective cohort study.  Macular degeneration is an eye disease that can impair vision or cause blindness. It is a major cause of vision loss among Americans.  This prospective observational study suggests that a high intake of folate may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration. However, this study couldn’t prove causality. Other nutrients in high-folate foods could be responsible.   8. Digestive Health  FODMAPs alter symptoms and the metabolome of patients with IBS: a randomised controlled trial.  FODMAPs are a fiber that may cause digestive issues, bloating, flatulence and stomach pain. They may also trigger symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  This randomized controlled trial showed that FODMAPs were directly linked to worsened IBS symptoms and changes in the gut microbiota.   9. Kidney and Urinary Health  Vitamin D and incident urinary incontinence in older adults.  This observational study suggests that high circulating levels of vitamin D improve bladder control in older adults.   10. Bone Health  Long-term effects of a very low carbohydrate weight loss diet and an isocaloric low-fat diet on bone health in obese adults.  Many people worry that very low-carb diets may affect bone health. However, there isn’t much evidence from long-term, human trials.  This randomized controlled trial of 118 obese adults showed that a 12-month, low-carb diet did not reduce bone mineral content, bone density or other markers or bone health, compared to a low-fat diet.   11. Muscles and Physical Performance  Dietary protein intake is associated with better physical function and muscle strength among elderly women.  This observational study found that dietary protein intake was linked with greater muscle strength and better physical function among elderly women.   12. Infections and Immune Health  Levels of innate immune factors in preterm and term mothers’ breast milk during the 1st month postpartum.  Prematurely born infants have immature immune systems, and are therefore prone to infections. However, breast milk contains several important immunologic factors that may protect premature infants.  This study showed that the breast milk of mothers who have premature babies contained greater amounts of some immune proteins than full-term breast milk.   Vitamin D Supplementation and the Risk of Colds in Patients with Asthma.  This randomized controlled trial showed that vitamin D supplementation, a single dose of 100,000 IU and then 4,000 IU/day for 28 weeks, did not affect the frequency or severity of colds in adults with asthma.  However, a sub-group analysis showed that supplementing with vitamin D increased the risk of cold among African Americans.   13. Skin Health  Vitamin D levels and atopic eczema in infancy and early childhood in Norway: a cohort study.  This observational study found no significant links between vitamin D levels and eczema in Norwegian children.   14. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Calcium Supplementation to Prevent Preeclampsia: Translating Guidelines into Practice in Low-Income Countries.  Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disorder characterized by high blood pressure and other symptoms. It increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and may lead to seizures (eclampsia) if untreated.  Calcium supplements are recommended during pregnancy to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. This review discusses how these recommendations should be translated into practice in low-income countries.   15. Contaminants and Food Safety  Endocrine-disrupting polychlorinated biphenyls in metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese subjects before and after weight loss: difference at the start but not at the finish.  Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental contaminants that may disrupt the endocrine system . Studies have found that PCB levels are higher in metabolically unhealthy obese people, compared to healthy obese people.  This study found that PCBs did not differ depending on metabolic health. Also, the levels of PCBs did not seem to affect the health benefits of weight loss.   16. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Coffee, maté, açaí and beans are the main contributors to the antioxidant capacity of Brazilian’s diet.  This study found that Brazilian people get most of their antioxidants from coffee. Other major sources were maté tea, red wine, acai berries and beans.   Gastrointestinal modifications and bioavailability of brown seaweed phlorotannins and effects on inflammatory markers.  Brown varieties of seaweed, such as the knotted kelp, are a rich source of antioxidant phlorotannins .  This human trial showed that phlorotannins are absorbed into the bloodstream, mainly from the colon. Supplementing with phlorotannins also led to significantly higher circulating levels of an inflammatory marker called interleukin 8 (IL-8).   Protein “requirements” beyond the RDA: implications for optimizing health.  Growing evidence suggests that eating high-quality protein, even above the recommended daily allowance, may promote better health.  This review discusses the potential benefits of high protein consumption. The authors found no consistent evidence linking high protein intake with kidney disease or low bone mass.

	Low-Calorie Sweeteners May Help You Lose Weight  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 16, 2016  Replacing sugar with low-calorie sweeteners can reduce your calorie intake, and may lead to weight loss.  However, some people claim that low-calorie sweeteners promote weight gain.  For this reason, a group of scientists assessed the overall evidence in a systematic review and meta-analyses of studies in both animals and humans.   Background  Low-calorie sweeteners are widely used throughout the world. They can be added to food, but are also found in processed foods and diet sodas.  The most common low-calorie sweeteners include acesulfame-K , aspartame , saccharin , stevia and sucralose .  Even though low-calorie sweeteners contain less calories than sugar, some researchers have speculated that consuming them may lead to weight gain ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Low-calorie sweeteners might affect body weight in several ways:   Calorie intake: Replacing sugar with sweeteners may cause you to eat more later on ( 4 ).  Label awareness: When food or drinks are labeled as low-calorie, some people may eat larger portions, eat more of other foods or eat more later on ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ).  Added sweetness: Sweetness might increase calorie intake by making foods more satisfactory or pleasant to eat ( 9 ).  Energy balance: Low-calorie sweeteners may disrupt how the body associates sweetness with calorie intake, impairing energy balance ( 10 ).   Article Reviewed  A team of European researchers from the International Life Science Institute looked at how low-calorie sweeteners affect body weight and calorie intake.  Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including metaanalyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effects of consuming low-calorie sweeteners on calorie intake or body weight.  Several meta-analyses were conducted on different types of studies published before February 1st, 2015. These included intervention studies, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and animal studies.  Randomized, Controlled Trials (RCTs)  The review included 56 randomized, controlled trials or intervention studies that were divided into two categories, depending on their duration:   Short-term: RCTs that were shorter or equal to one day in length.  Long-term: RCTs that lasted for 10 days or longer.   Observational Studies  The review included the results of 12 observational studies, but only nine were used in meta-analyses.  All of these were prospective cohort studies, which measured habitual intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or diet beverages at one time point, and then followed the participants for more than one year.  This allowed the researchers to find out if sugar or low-calorie sweeteners were associated with changes in body weight.  Animal Studies  The researchers reviewed 62 articles, which reported the results of 90 studies examining the effects of low-calorie sweeteners on mice or rats.  These studies were divided into three groups, depending on their purpose:   Forced consumption: These studies examined the effects of forced consumption of low-calorie sweeteners.  Voluntary consumption: These studies examined the effects of voluntary consumption of low-calorie sweeteners.  Learning studies: These studies tested the hypothesis that rats fed low-calorie sweeteners will stop associating sweetness with additional calories.   Bottom Line: This analysis combined the results of randomized controlled trials, observational studies and animal studies published before 2015.  Finding 1: Low-Calorie Sweeteners Reduce Short-Term Calorie Intake  A total of 56 randomized, controlled trials, or intervention studies, lasting less than one day, were included in this systematic review.  These studies examined the effects of consuming low-calorie sweeteners on subsequent or total calorie intake.  The results of these studies were combined in a meta-analysis. Their main results are presented below.  Low-Calorie Sweeteners vs. Sugar  The meta-analysis showed that consuming low-calorie sweeteners, rather than sugar, significantly reduced overall calorie intake in both adults and children.  In addition, the analysis found that people tended to compensate for the reduced calorie intake by eating more at a subsequent meal. However, the calorie compensation was only partial.  Low-Calorie Sweeteners vs. Unsweetened Beverages/Food  Beverages or foods sweetened with low-calorie sweeteners did not significantly affect calorie intake, compared to the same foods without low-calorie sweeteners.  Similarly, diet beverages did not significantly affect calorie intake, compared to water.  Low-Calorie Sweeteners in Capsules vs. Placebos  When low-calorie sweeteners were given in capsules, they tended to reduce calorie intake, compared to placebo capsules.  One study found that taking a capsule containing aspartame, an amount similar to that found in diet sodas, reduced calorie intake, compared to a placebo ( 11 ).  The reason for these effects is unknown.  Summary  Overall, these studies consistently found that eating low-calorie sweeteners instead of sugar before a meal significantly reduced short-term calorie intake. On average, the difference was 94 calories.  The effects of eating low-calorie sweeteners were similar to drinking plain water.  Bottom Line: The results of short-term intervention studies suggest that consuming low-calorie sweeteners reduces short-term calorie intake.  Finding 2: Low-Calorie Sweeteners Reduce Long-Term Calorie Intake and Body Weight  This systematic review included a number of long-term intervention studies, ranging from 10 days to 3 years.  Calorie Intake  Nine intervention studies reported results for calorie intake.  Three of the studies found that consuming low-calorie sweeteners caused a significantly lower calorie intake ( 12 , 13 , 14 ).  Conversely, three studies found no significant difference ( 15 , 16 , 17 ).  The rest did not report the results of tests for statistical significance ( 18 , 19 , 20 ).  Body Weight  A total of 10 long-term, interventional studies examined the effects of low-calorie sweeteners on body weight.  Five studies showed that consuming low-calorie sweeteners had significant benefits:   One study of obese women linked consuming aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages to greater weight loss and less weight regain ( 15 ).  Another study linked sugar supplements to increased calorie intake and weight gain, while artificial sweeteners had no adverse effects ( 12 ).  An aspartame-sweetened beverage reduced body weight in men, but not women. The same beverage, sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, increased body weight ( 20 ).  This 18-month trial in children found that replacing sugary soda with diet soda reduced body weight and fat accumulation ( 21 ).  A 12-month weight-loss trial showed that drinking an artificially sweetened beverage led to greater weight loss than plain water ( 22 ).   Conversely, the other half of the studies found no significant improvements, compared to sugar or water ( 16 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 24 ).  These studies were combined in a meta-analysis, which found that consuming low-calorie sweeteners led to a smaller weight gain, or greater weight loss, than sugar.  Summary  In short, the meta-analysis showed that eating low-calorie sweeteners caused a significant weight loss of about 3 lbs (1.35 kg).  Bottom Line: The meta-analyses of the RCTs showed that consuming low-calorie sweeteners reduced calorie intake and body weight.  Finding 3: Observational Studies Provide Inconsistent Results  A total of 12 observational studies examined the effects of diet sodas on body weight.  Overall, the results were mixed:   Higher risk of obesity: Five studies found that diet sodas were associated with a higher risk of obesity ( 3 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ).  Lower risk of obesity: Six studies showed that diet sodas were linked with a lower risk of obesity ( 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ).   Meta-analyses combining the results from nine of these studies found no significant associations between diet sodas and changes in body mass index (BMI).  However, inconsistencies in the studies’ findings make it difficult to interpret the results. Additionally, observational studies cannot prove causation.  Bottom Line: The observational studies provided inconsistent findings. The meta-analysis found no significant links between low-calorie sweeteners and BMI.  Finding 4: Low-Calorie Sweeteners Do Not Affect Body Weight in Animals  The majority of animal studies suggest that eating low-calorie sweeteners does not affect body weight.  Forced Consumption  The review included 45 articles on 47 studies where rats or mice were fed specific amounts of low-calorie sweeteners.  The majority of the studies found no significant effects of low-calorie sweeteners on body weight.  However, 18 studies that used higher doses showed that low-calorie sweeteners decreased body weight. Conversely, a few studies reported significant increases in body weight:   One study showed that saccharin increased body weight when it made up 1% of the diet, but higher doses had no effects ( 33 ).  Other studies, using lower doses of saccharin, also found no significant effects ( 34 , 35 , 36 ).  When saccharin, cyclamate , acesulfame-K or aspartame were added to drinking water, only saccharin and cyclamate significantly increased body weight ( 37 ).  Another study found that low doses of cyclamate caused significant weight gain, but later studies were unable to replicate these findings ( 38 , 39 , 40 ).   Voluntary Consumption  The review included 10 articles, reporting the findings of 21 studies in which rats were given the chance to eat artificial sweeteners.  Most of these studies, which offered a 0.1â0.2% saccharine solution or water, found no significant effects of saccharine on body weight ( 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 44 ).  However, a few studies found that adding saccharin (0.2%) to water-mixed lab chow led to significantly greater calorie intake and weight gain ( 46 ).  Another study found that yogurt sweetened with aspartame or saccharin caused greater calorie consumption and weight gain, compared to yogurt sweetened with sucrose ( 47 ).  Learning Studies  The review included seven articles discussing 22 learning studies.  A total of 14 studies (64%) showed that rats with access to food with low-calorie sweeteners gained more weight than those with access to glucose-sweetened food.  The relevance of these studies for humans remains unclear.  Bottom Line: When low-calorie sweeteners improve the taste of food, they may increase body weight in animals. However, the majority of studies suggest that low-calorie sweeteners, on their own, do not affect body weight.  Limitations  This systematic review and meta-analysis had a few limitations.  First, it did not differentiate between the various types of low-calorie sweeteners. These may have different effects on body weight and health.  Second, some of the authors have ties to companies that produce low-calorie sweeteners, potentially creating a conflict of interest.  Summary and Real-Life Application  The majority of the evidence shows that using low-calorie sweeteners instead of sugar is beneficial, or at least neutral, when it comes to weight.  Another recent meta-analysis reached a similar conclusion ( 48 ).  If you prefer to sweeten your food, replacing sugar with low-calorie sweeteners may be an effective weight loss strategy, when combined with other lifestyle changes.

	Protein Reduces Appetite More Than Carbs and Fat  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 14, 2016  Eating protein leads to a greater reduction in appetite, compared to fat or carbs.  However, no previous studies have looked into the effects of specific proportions of protein, carbs and fat in a systematic, dose-response manner.  For this reason, scientists examined the effects of five drinks containing different proportions of these nutrients.   Background  Protein is generally considered to be the most filling macronutrient, whereas fat is the least filling. However, not all studies support this ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ).  This may be because protein and carbs suppress the hunger hormone, ghrelin , more than fat ( 6 , 7 ).  Another hormone that may be involved is the satiety hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, it’s currently unclear which macronutrient has the greatest effect on GLP-1 ( 8 , 9 ).  Article Reviewed  Scientists from Lund University, in Sweden, examined how different macronutrient proportions affected calorie intake, appetite hormones and appetite.  Protein-Enriched Liquid Preloads Varying in Macronutrient Content Modulate Appetite and Appetite-Regulating Hormones in Healthy Adults.  Study Design  This was a randomized, crossover trial examining the effects of liquid meals — varying in protein, fat and carbs — on appetite, appetite hormones and calorie intake.  A total of 36 healthy men and women participated in the study.  They were assigned to five different liquid meals, which they received on separate days in a random order:   Low-protein, low-carb, high-fat drink (LP/LC:HF): 8.9% of calories from protein, 28% from carbs and 63.1% from fat.  High-protein, low-carb, medium-fat drink (HP/LC:MF): 40% of calories from protein, 18.5% from carbs and 41.5% from fat.  Low-protein, high-carb, low-fat drink (LP/HC:LF): 8.9% of calories from protein, 71.1% from carbs and 20% from fat.  High-protein, medium-carb, low-fat drink (HP/MC:LF): 40% of calories from protein, 46.8% from carbs and 13.2% from fat.  Medium-protein, medium-carb, medium-fat drink (MP/MC:MF): 24.4% of calories from protein, 50.4% from carbs and 25.2% from fat. This drink was replicated three times.   These liquid meals were based on milk protein isolate, rapeseed oil and a mixture of maltodextrin and table sugar. All of them contained 502 calories (2,100 kJ), and had the same volume of 670 mL.  After finishing the drink on each of the seven test days, the participants rated their appetite every 30 minutes until they had a lunch test meal.  During the same period, the researchers collected blood samples every hour. The blood samples were analyzed for the appetite hormones, ghrelin and GLP-1.  The purpose of the lunch test meal was to measure calorie intake. It was served 3.5 hours after the breakfast, and was based on pasta. The participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wanted.  Bottom Line: This randomized, crossover study examined the effects of liquid meals, varying in protein, carbs and fat, on appetite hormones, self-rated appetite and calorie intake.  Finding 1: Protein Tended to Lower Appetite  Every half an hour after finishing the test drink, the participants were asked to rate their feelings of appetite on a visual analog scale (VAS).  The VAS included the following feelings:   Hunger.  Desire to eat.  Fullness.  Prospective food consumption.   The researchers found that subjective ratings for fullness were significantly greater after HP/MC:LF than after LP/LC:HF.  Similarly, prospective food consumption ratings were 12% lower after the intake of HP/MC:LF, and 11% lower after the intake of HP/LC:MF, compared to LP/LC:HF.  The findings are presented in the chart below:   However, there were no significant differences in any of the ratings between HP/MC:LF and LP/HC:LF, indicating that carbs may have some filling effects as well.  Overall, protein appeared to be the most filling macronutrient, while fat was the least filling. No significant differences in hunger or desire to eat were seen.  Bottom Line: Protein reduced self-rated appetite more than carbs and fat, and appears to be the most filling of the three macronutrients.  Finding 2: Calorie Intake Was Unaffected  There were no significant differences in how the meals affected calorie intake at lunch, 3.5 hours after they were consumed.  Some evidence indicates that liquid calories have weaker effects on appetite and calorie intake, compared to solid calories ( 10 ).  Also, the effects of these drinks on appetite may have faded 3.5 hours afterwards.  Bottom Line: The various liquid meals had no significantly different effects on calorie intake at a lunch eaten 3.5 hours afterwards.  Finding 3: Protein Increased Levels of GLP-1  Circulating levels of the appetite-suppressing hormone, GLP-1, were higher after the HP/LC:MF drink, compared to the other liquid meals.  This can be seen in the chart below:   Specifically, the levels of GLP-1 were generally 13–19% higher after the HP/LC:MF drink. This suggests that the appetite-suppressing effects of protein may be at least partly due to increases in GLP-1.  However, fat appeared to increase GLP-1 to some extent as well. These findings are supported by several previous studies ( 9 , 11 , 12 ).  Conversely, no significant changes in the hunger hormone, ghrelin, were detected between liquid meals.  Bottom Line: Protein appeared to increase circulating levels of the appetite-suppressing hormone, GLP-1.  Limitations  Although the study’s design did not have any serious shortfalls, a few limitations should be mentioned.  First, including both men and women caused significant variations in calorie intake. This might have masked the effects of the liquid meals on calorie intake at lunch.  Additionally, the generalizability of the findings is limited. There is some evidence that liquid calories have weaker effects on appetite than solid calories ( 10 ).  Second, the drinks were not typical breakfast foods. One study indicates that novelty may affect satiety ( 13 ).  Finally, not all types of protein, carbs and fat affect appetite the same ( 14 , 15 , 16 ).  Bottom Line: The study’s findings may not be generalized to all situations. For example, the liquid form of the drinks may have affected the results.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that protein reduces appetite more than carbs and fat. On the other hand, fat appeared to be less filling than protein and carbs.  Simply put, if you want to lose weight, adding more protein to your diet may help curb your appetite.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (March 4th–11th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 11, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, March 4th, to Friday, March 11th, 2016.   Research Reviews  In the past week, we reviewed two articles: one from the New England Journal of Medicine , and the other from PLOS ONE .   Review:  Eating Peanuts Early On Helps Prevent Allergy.  Article:  Effect of Avoidance on Peanut Allergy after Early Peanut Consumption.  Summary: This was a follow-up study of a trial examining the effects of eating peanuts from early age on the risk of becoming allergic to peanuts.  The trial found that eating peanuts from early age reduced the risk of peanut allergy. This follow-up study showed that the protective effect was maintained over a year.   Review:  Weight Loss Changes the Gut Microbiota.  Article:  Characterization of the Gut Microbial Community of Obese Patients Following a Weight-Loss Intervention Using Whole Metagenome Shotgun Sequencing.  Summary: This observational study examined changes in the gut microbiota during and after a weight loss trial.  Although the microbiota remained quite stable during the weight loss trial, the counts of some types of bacteria changed significantly. The study also found that some bacteria could be used to predict weight loss success.   New Research From Around the World  Quite a few interesting papers came to our attention this week. We have summarized the most interesting or relevant papers, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Liver Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Skin Health  Sleep  Pain  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Introduction of complementary feeding before 4 months of age increases the risk of childhood overweight or obesity: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that infants younger than four months should only be fed breastmilk, since eating other foods early on may increase the risk of weight gain or obesity later.   Vegetarianism and cardiometabolic disease risk factors: Differences between South Asian and American adults.  This observational study found that American vegetarians generally ate healthier food, compared to Asian vegetarians. However, both populations were less likely to be overweight or obese than non-vegetarians.   Inverse association between altitude and obesity: A prevalence study among Andean and low-altitude adult individuals of Peru.  This observational study in Peruvian adults found that those who lived high in the mountains were at a lower risk of gaining weight or becoming obese, compared to those who lived closer to sea level.   Antiobesity effect of Pediococcus pentosaceus LP28 on overweight subjects: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.  One previous study showed that the lactic acid bacterium, Pediococcus pentosaceus LP28 ( LP28 ), reduced obesity and fatty liver in obese mice on a high-fat diet.  This randomized, controlled trial in overweight humans showed that supplementing with heat-killed LP28, once a day for 12 weeks, reduced BMI, body fat and waist circumference.   Effects of a mindfulness-based weight loss intervention in adults with obesity: A randomized clinical trial.  This randomized, controlled trial did not show any significant benefits from promoting mindfulness during a weight-loss program.  However, the authors concluded that further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of mindful eating on the long-term maintenance of weight loss and metabolic heath.   Maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, breastfeeding and childhood overweight at age 2 years.  This observational study indicates that children who have mothers who were overweight or obese before pregnancy, or gained excessive weight during pregnancy, are more likely to be overweight when they are two years of age.  The study also suggests that breastfeeding for 6 months or longer may reduce the child’s risk of gaining excessive weight until the age of two.   Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including meta-analyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that consuming low-calorie sweeteners does not lead to weight gain.  The evidence indicates that choosing low-calorie sweeteners instead of sugar leads to lower calorie intake and body weight in both adults and children.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Mechanisms linking the gut microbiome and glucose metabolism.  Type 2 diabetes is associated with an imbalance in the gut microbiota ( dysbiosis ). Restoring the gut microbiota by changing the diet or supplementing with probiotics may improve blood sugar control.  This scientific review discusses the potential of treating type 2 diabetes by targeting the gut microbiota. It also points out possible explanations for the link between the gut microbiota, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders.   Effect of soy protein isolate preload on postprandial glycemic control in healthy humans.  This experiment showed that eating soy protein, 20 or 40 grams, before eating carbs (75 g of glucose) improved the blood sugar response by increasing the production of insulin and delaying stomach emptying.   3. Heart Health  Excess protein intake relative to fiber and cardiovascular events in elderly men with chronic kidney disease.  This observational study in elderly men with chronic kidney disease indicates that when protein intake is high, relative to fiber, their risk of heart disease is higher than when the ratio of protein to fiber is lower.   4. Cancer  Dietary Fiber Intake in Young Adults and Breast Cancer Risk.  This observational study suggests that fiber intake during adolescence and early adult life may reduce the risk of breast cancer.   Glycemic Index, Glycemic Load, and Lung Cancer Risk in Non-Hispanic Whites.  This observational study indicates that eating lots of foods high on the glycemic index may increase the risk of lung cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Protein-Enriched Liquid Preloads Varying in Macronutrient Content Modulate Appetite and Appetite-Regulating Hormones in Healthy Adults.  This randomized trial examined the effects of consuming liquids varying in protein, carbs and fat on appetite. It showed that protein reduced appetite more than carbs and fat.   Overeating at dinner time among Japanese workers: Is overeating related to stress response and late dinner times?  This observational study in Japanese men suggests that psychological stress makes them more likely to overeat at dinner.   6. Liver Health  Changes in the Intestinal Microbiome and Alcoholic- and Non-alcoholic Liver Diseases—Causes or Effects?  Fatty liver disease is characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells. It is often associated with heavy alcohol consumption, obesity and metabolic syndrome.  Severe fatty liver disease is associated with inflammation and may progress to cirrhosis . This review discusses the potential role of the microbiota in fatty liver disease, and the possibility of treating it by targeting the microbiota.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  Ratio of Dietary n-3 and n-6 Fatty Acids—Independent Determinants of Muscle Mass—in Hemodialysis Patients with Diabetes.  This observational study in patients with kidney failure and type 2 diabetes examined the association of fatty acids and muscle mass.  It found that a high intake of omega-3 fat, relative to omega-6, was significantly linked with higher muscle mass.   8. Arthritis  Intake of high-fructose corn syrup sweetened soft drinks, fruit drinks and apple juice is associated with prevalent arthritis in US adults, aged 20–30 years.  This observational study suggests that drinking lots of soft drinks sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup may increase the risk of arthritis in young US adults.  According to the enFruAGEs hypothesis, poor fructose absorption due to excess free fructose may lead to inflammation in joints.   Vitamin D Supplementation, Tibial Cartilage Volume, and Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis.  A few observational studies suggest that supplementing with vitamin D may improve symptoms of knee osteoarthritis , but not all studies agree.  This randomized, controlled trial in 413 people with knee osteoarthritis and low circulating levels of vitamin D found that supplementing with 50,000 IU of vitamin D, every month for two years, did not increase cartilage or reduce knee pain.   9. Allergies  Randomized Trial of Introduction of Allergenic Foods in Breast-Fed Infants.  This randomized trial in breast-fed infants examined the effects of the early introduction of six allergenic foods — peanuts, eggs, cow’s milk, sesame, whitefish and wheat — on the risk of developing allergy to these foods.  The study suggests that when children start eating peanuts and eggs at three months of age, they have less risk of developing allergies when they are 1–3 years old, as long they eat at least 2 grams per week.   10. Skin Health  Synbiotics for Prevention and Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis. A Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.  Eczema, is a chronic skin condition characterized by itchy, dry and red skin.  This meta-analysis of randomized trials indicates that taking synbiotics — the combination of probiotics and prebiotics — may help treat eczema. Synbiotics with several different types of bacteria appear to be the most effective.   11. Sleep  Dinner fat intake and sleep duration and self-reported sleep parameters over five years: findings from the Jiangsu Nutrition Study of Chinese adults.  This observational study in Chinese adults showed that a high fat intake at dinner was linked with shorter sleep duration. Similarly, a high fat intake at breakfast was associated with a reduced risk of falling asleep during the daytime.   12. Pain  Tolerance and efficacy of a polyamine-deficient diet for the treatment of perioperative pain.  Polyamines are a group of nutrients that appear to be necessary for cell division. However, if their levels are too high, they may bind to pain receptors, causing pain.  They are produced by the body in small quantities, but we also get them from the diet. This randomized trial found that eliminating polyamines from the diet reduced self-rated pain after surgery.   13. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Effect of Ultraviolet Light-Exposed Mushrooms on Vitamin D Status: Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Reanalysis of Biobanked Sera from a Randomized Controlled Trial and a Systematic Review plus Meta-Analysis.  When mushrooms are exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet (UV) light, they naturally produce vitamin D.  This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that eating UV-exposed mushrooms may increase circulating vitamin D when people are low in it.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Weight Loss Changes the Gut Microbiota  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 9, 2016  The gut microbiota is one of the most highly active areas of research in nutrition.  Recently, a team of researchers examined the effects of a weight-loss program on the gut microbiota of obese individuals.  Here we discuss their main results, recently published in PLOS ONE .   Background  The gut microbiota appears to play a role in obesity and metabolic disorders, as discussed in our previous research review .  What you eat significantly affects the types of bacteria that thrive in your gut. These bacteria may also respond to sudden dietary changes or weight loss ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ).  This is because the bacteria feed on what you eat. What’s more, individual species of bacteria are often highly selective, feeding only on certain food components.  In this way, your diet can influence health through its effects on the gut microbiota.  Article Reviewed  A team of German scientists examined changes in the gut microbiota during a weight-loss program in obese people.  Characterization of the Gut Microbial Community of Obese Patients Following a Weight-Loss Intervention Using Whole Metagenome Shotgun Sequencing.  Study Design  This observational study examined changes in the gut microbiota during and after a weight-loss program in obese adults.  The researchers also wanted to find out if bacteria in stool samples could predict successful weight loss, or if the microbiota of people with metabolic syndrome or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease differed from that of healthy individuals.  The weight-loss trial lasted for one year. It involved a 3-month, very low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day) using a dietary formula enriched in inulin .  After that, the participants gradually replaced the formula with real food, and started weight maintenance. Additionally, the program involved exercise and behavioral therapy. These results and methods are described elsewhere ( 6 ).  In the present observational study, 16 obese individuals who participated in the trial were chosen based on their weight-loss success.  These 16 individuals were followed for two years — for the duration of the weight-loss trial and for another year afterwards.  Based on their weight-loss success, they were divided into two groups:   Persistent weight-loss success: A total of nine participants were successful in maintaining a 10% weight loss for one year after the weight-loss trial finished.  No persistent success: Seven of the participants were not successful in maintaining their weight.   The researchers analyzed the participants at the start of the study and after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Using DNA sequencing, they measured the types and numbers of bacteria in stool samples.  Bottom Line: This was an observational study examining changes in the gut microbiota during and following a weight-loss trial. It also investigated whether the microbiota profile could predict weight-loss success.  Finding 1: Weight Loss Changed the Gut Microbiota  The study detected around 2,000 different types of bacteria in the participants’ stool samples. There was high individual variability in the microbiota profile, and some species were only found in one or a few of the participants.  The microbiota turned out to be quite stable during the weight-loss trial. Yet, the researchers detected 56 species of bacteria whose numbers changed significantly, mainly during the three months of calorie restriction.  Most notably, the following groups increased in counts: Alistipes , Lachnospiraceae , Ethanoligenens and Holdemania .  HIV patients have lower levels of Alistipes than healthy people. However, some studies also link high levels with an increased health risk ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Only one group, Roseburia , decreased significantly. This group of bacteria convert fiber into butyrate, a healthy short-chain fatty acid.  Previous studies have shown that counts of Roseburia decrease during a low-carb, weight-loss diet among obese individuals ( 12 , 13 ).  However, these changes were only temporary. After the 3-month weight-loss period, the counts of these bacteria gradually returned to initial levels.  When the whole 2-year study period was examined, only Akkermansia increased significantly. Specifically, it increased 11-fold, from 0.26 to 2.9% of total counts.  Bottom Line: The gut microbiota in obese adults changed during the weight-loss program, which involved an inulin-enriched, calorie-reduced diet.  Finding 2: Certain Groups of Bacteria Predicted Successful Weight Loss  Participants who consistently lost weight over the 2-year study had a slightly different microbiota at the start of the study, compared to those who were unsuccessful.  Specifically, they had a microbiota rich in the following groups of bacteria:   Alistipes .  Pseudoflavonifractor .  Ethanoligenens .  Gordonibacter .  Symbiobacterium .   The level of weight loss was also linked with increases to the numbers of bacteria of the genus Akkermansia in stool samples.  Studies show that high counts of Akkermansia are linked with a reduced risk of obesity and metabolic disorders. It may also reflect a healthy gut microbiota ( 14 , 15 ).  By looking at food diaries, the researchers couldn’t find any dietary patterns explaining these differences.  Bottom Line: Successful weight loss was linked with higher initial counts of certain bacteria, such as Alistipes . Weight loss was also associated with higher counts of Akkermansia throughout the study.  Finding 3: The Ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes Was Not Linked With Obesity  Previous observational studies indicate that a high ratio of bacteria in the groups Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (FB) is linked with increased body weight ( 16 , 17 ).  In an attempt to explain this, scientists have speculated that Firmicutes may increase calorie absorption. In fact, they convert fiber into short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, which are absorbed by the cells lining the colon ( 18 ).  However, the current study did not find the ratio of FB to be significantly associated with body weight. This is consistent with other observational studies ( 19 , 20 , 21 ).  These inconsistencies might be explained by genetic differences. One recent study suggests that numbers of Firmicutes may depend on individual genetics, whereas numbers of Bacteroidetes are mainly influenced by diet ( 22 ).  Bottom Line: Unlike some studies, this study did not find a significant link between the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and body weight.  Finding 4: Metabolic Syndrome Was Associated With a Different Microbiota Profile  The ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was significantly higher (0.64) in those with metabolic syndrome at the start of the study, compared with those who were “healthy” obese (0.27).  Counts of Akkermansia were also lower in those with metabolic syndrome.  Additionally, the researchers compared the bacterial composition of people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to those who didnât have it.  These analyzes were done at the end of the study, to minimize the influence of the weight-loss trial.  They found several significant differences. Participants with NAFLD had:   Lower counts of Subdoligranulum , which are also lacking in patients with cirrhosis ( 23 ).  Lower counts of Lactococcus , which produce lactic acid from glucose and are used in the production of fermented dairy products, such as cheese. They may slow the development of colitis in mice ( 24 ).  Higher counts of Paraprevotella .   Bottom Line: Metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were linked with differences in the gut microbiota.  Limitations  This study had several limitations. First, it was an observational study that couldn’t demonstrate causation.  Apart from the weight loss, several other factors were likely to have affected the microbiota. These include the probiotic inulin in the weight-loss formula ( 25 , 26 ).  Second, the study was very small, including only 16 obese adults. This limited its statistical power.  Third, the participants were selected to reduce individual variability. For this reason, the results may not apply to all obese people.  Bottom Line: This observational study has a few limitations, including small size. It also can’t demonstrate causation, and its findings may be limited.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study indicates that the bacterial composition of stool samples may be used to predict success during a weight-loss program.  Specifically, high levels of Akkermansia were the strongest predictor of weight-loss success. However, these findings have no real-life application for weight loss.  Yet they are important to science, helping us understand what role the gut microbiota plays in obesity, weight loss and health.  Tags: Gut microbiota , Weight loss

	Eating Peanuts Early On Helps Prevent Allergy  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 7, 2016  A previous study found that when children at a high risk of peanut allergy started eating peanuts at an early age, their risk of developing an allergy decreased ( 1 , 2 ).  This same research group also did a follow-up study, examining whether the incidence of peanut allergy remained low when children avoided peanuts for 1 year.  The results were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine .   Background  It’s estimated that about 1% of Americans are allergic to peanuts, which are considered to be one of the most severe allergens ( 3 , 4 ).  Allergies can be treated with antihistamines or by avoiding the allergen, but studies on allergen immunotherapy have provided some promising results.  Allergen immunotherapy , also known as desensitization, involves gradually exposing people to large amounts of allergens in the hope of making the immune system less sensitive or even unresponsive to them.  Long-term immunotherapy, using eggs, pollen or bee venom, may lead to long-term benefits or unresponsiveness to these allergens ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Study Reviewed  This follow-up is an extension of a study that examined how eating peanuts when young affected later allergy risk. This follow-up looked into what happened when participants avoided peanuts for a year.  Effect of Avoidance on Peanut Allergy after Early Peanut Consumption .  Study Design  This was a follow-up study to a previous randomized, controlled trial, known as the Learning About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study.  Original LEAP Study  The LEAP trial examined how early peanut introduction affected children at a high risk of developing a peanut allergy. Children were considered at a high risk of allergies if they already had food allergies or severe eczema.  The researchers randomized the participants into 2 groups:   Peanut consumption: From the first year of their life, these children ate peanuts or peanut-containing foods. This continued until they were 5 years old.  Peanut avoidance: From the first year of their life, these children avoided peanuts.   The study found that introducing peanuts to the diet early on resulted in an 81% lower risk of allergy when the children were 5, compared to avoiding peanuts ( 1 , 2 ).  Follow-Up LEAP-ON Study  The follow-up to the LEAP study, called the Persistence of Oral Tolerance to Peanut study (LEAP-ON), included 556 participants from the LEAP trial.  They were told to avoid eating peanuts for one year. This helped the researchers find out if sustained peanut consumption is required to maintain the protective effects against peanut allergy.  After this 12-month follow-up, the researchers examined the percentage of participants with peanut allergy in both study groups.  Bottom Line: The LEAP trial showed that eating peanuts early on protected children from peanut allergy. A follow-up study looked into whether these protective effects continued after one year of avoiding peanuts.  Study Results  The LEAP trial showed that eating peanuts from the first year of age protected the majority of high-risk children from developing a peanut allergy.  At the end of the 4-year study period, the incidence of peanut allergy was 81% lower for those who consumed peanuts, compared to those who did not ( 1 , 2 ).  This extension of the LEAP trial found that when the participants avoided peanuts for 12 months, it did not increase their risk of becoming allergic to peanuts.  Specifically, the incidence of peanut allergy was 74% lower among those who had consumed peanuts, compared to those who avoided peanuts.  The chart below shows the differences between groups at the end of the study.   Simply put, the protective effects of eating peanuts early in life continue even if peanuts are avoided for 1 year after early exposure.  However, further studies are needed to see how long these effects do last.  Bottom Line: The study found that the protective effects of eating peanuts from an early age continued even if peanuts were avoided for one year after early exposure.  Limitations  This study did not have any obvious limitations.  It seems to have been planned and implemented well, and conducted by a highly-regarded team of scientists and allergy doctors. Adherence was also excellent.  However, the study was not designed to determine the amount or frequency of peanut consumption needed to provide benefits. Also, it is unclear whether the effects persist after many years of peanut avoidance.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In summary, this study showed that eating peanuts from an early age may protect against the development of peanut allergy.  However, this should not be tried at home. This study was conducted under controlled conditions and supervised by professional allergists.  Further studies are needed before any general advice can be given.  Tags: Allergy , Immunotherapy , Peanuts

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Feb 26th–March 4th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 4, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, February 26th, to Friday, March 4th, 2016.   Research Reviews  In the past week, we reviewed two articles: one published in the British Journal of Nutrition and the other from Appetite .   Review:  Organic Meat is Higher in Omega-3 and Polyunsaturated Fat.  Article:  Composition differences between organic and conventional meat: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.  Summary: This study compared the fat content of organic and non-organic meat.  The main results were that organic meat was higher in polyunsaturated fat, including omega-3 and omega-6, and monounsaturated fat. Since meat is a small dietary source of these nutrients, the health relevance of the findings is unclear.   Review:  For Food Addicts, Mood Affects Attention to Junk Food.  Article:  A sad mood increases attention to unhealthy food images in women with food addiction.  Summary: This experiment examined the effects of watching a sad film on attention to unhealthy foods among women with and without food addiction.  The study found that only women who were food addicts increased their attention to unhealthy foods when sad, whereas women without food addiction did not.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new papers came to our attention this week. Here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Infections and Immune Health  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Men’s Health  Contaminants and Food Safety  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Characterization of the Gut Microbial Community of Obese Patients Following a Weight-Loss Intervention Using Whole Metagenome Shotgun Sequencing.  Observational studies have shown that the gut microbiota of obese people is different from that of normal-weight people. This study found that a 52-week weight loss program led to changes in the gut bacteria of obese individuals.  However, the gut microbiota gradually returned to initial levels after the program finished, except for levels of Akkermansia , which remained elevated for 2 years.   Maternal plasma PUFA concentrations during pregnancy and childhood adiposity: the Generation R Study.  This observational study found that lower intakes of omega-3 fat and higher intakes of omega-6 fat during pregnancy are linked to more body fat in the child.   Dairy consumption in association with weight change and risk of becoming overweight or obese in middle-aged and older women: a prospective cohort study.  This prospective observational study of middle-aged and elderly women suggests that eating dairy products may reduce their risk of weight gain or obesity. However, this only applied to full-fat dairy products, and not low-fat dairy.   A randomized trial of high-dairy-protein, variable-carbohydrate diets and exercise on body composition in adults with obesity.  This randomized, controlled trial of overweight or obese people examined the effects of different amounts of protein (P), carbs (C) and fat (F) on weight loss during a 16-week, high-protein weight-loss program with exercise training.  The diets were as follows: 1) 40% C, 30% P and 30% F; 2) 55% C, 30% P and 15% F; or 3) 55% C, 15% P and 30% F. Weight loss, fat loss and changes in lean mass were similar in all groups.   Association between Maternal Fish Consumption and Gestational Weight Gain: Influence of Molecular Genetic Predisposition to Obesity.  This observational study in Danish women found no significant association between fish consumption and weight gain during pregnancy.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Consumption of dairy foods and diabetes incidence: a dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that a high intake of dairy products was associated with a lower occurrence of type 2 diabetes.  When individual dairy products were examined separately, yogurt (80 grams/day) appeared to be especially protective. Eating ice cream (10 grams/day) was also linked with a reduced risk, but higher quantities did not provide an added benefit.   Roasting intensity of naturally low-caffeine coffee modulates glucose metabolism and redox balance in humans.  This small, randomized, crossover study showed that drinking 4 cups of dark-roasted coffee per day, for one week, improved blood sugar control, antioxidant status and omega-3 levels in red blood cells, compared to drinking light-roasted coffee.   3. Heart Health  Flavonoid intake and incident hypertension in women.  This observational study in French, middle-aged women suggests that a higher intake of antioxidant flavonoids may protect against high blood pressure.   Plasma levels of marine n-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant recipients.  This observational study in Norwegian kidney transplant recipients found that high circulating levels of omega-3 fatty acids were linked to a lower resting heart rate, lower blood sugar and triglyceride levels, and higher HDL-cholesterol levels.   Vegetarianism, low meat consumption and the risk of lung, postmenopausal breast and prostate cancer in a population-based cohort study.  This observational study suggests that vegetarians, pescetarians and those who eat meat once per week are not at a reduced risk of developing breast or prostate cancer, compared to people who consume meat every day.   Serum magnesium is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in the Genetics of Atherosclerotic Disease (GEA) study.  This observational study in Mexican women suggests that low circulating levels of magnesium may increase the risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and calcification in arteries.   Consumption of Fish Oil Providing Amounts of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid That Can Be Obtained from the Diet Reduces Blood Pressure in Adults with Systolic Hypertension: A Retrospective Analysis.  This randomized, controlled trial suggests that the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may reduce blood pressure in people with isolated systolic hypertension .  EPA and DHA had significant effects even at daily doses as low as 0.7 grams. Conversely, doses ranging from 0.7 grams/day and 1.8 grams/day had no effects on blood pressure in people with healthy blood pressure levels.   4. Cancer  Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-style diet in relation to glioma: a case–control study.  Glioma is a type of cancer that starts in the brain or spinal cord, arising from the cells (glial cells) that insulate nerves.  This observational study in Iranian adults suggests that a high consumption of red meat and salt may increase the risk of glioma. Conversely, a diet rich in legumes, nuts and fruit was linked with a lower risk of glioma.   Dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer in Brazil: a case control study.  This observational study in Brazilian adults indicates that a high meat intake may increase the risk of colon cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Comparison of short-term energy intake and appetite responses to active and seated video gaming, in 8–11-year-old boys.  This study in 8–11 year old boys compared the effects of seated and active video gaming on appetite and calorie intake.  The study showed that calorie intake was lower during active video gaming. However, one hour after the gaming session had stopped, calorie intake was the same in both groups. Self-rated appetite did not differ at any point.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Vitamin B-12 concentration, memory performance, and hippocampal structure in patients with mild cognitive impairment.  This observational study found that vitamin B12 levels that were on the lower end of the normal range were associated with poorer memory in patients with mild cognitive impairment.   7. Digestive Health  Probiotics for the Prevention of Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Children.  This article discusses the recommendations of the Working Group on Probiotics of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition for the use of probiotics to treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children.  This group recommends using Lactobacillus rhamnosus and/or Saccharomyces boulardii . Other probiotic strains have been tested, but the evidence is lacking.   8. Kidney and Urinary Health  The effects of a high protein diet on indices of health and body composition – a crossover trial in resistance-trained men.  This randomized, crossover study in healthy, strength-trained men who increased their daily protein intake showed that consuming 2.6 to 3.3 g/kg/day of protein for 4 months had no effects on blood lipids or markers of kidney or liver function.  The findings suggest that increasing the daily protein intake to over four times the recommended daily allowance has no adverse effects on kidney or liver function.   9. Bone Health  Associations of breast-feeding patterns and introduction of solid foods with childhood bone mass: The Generation R Study.  This observational study suggests that 6-year-old children who were breast-fed have a higher bone mass, compared to children who were never breast-fed.  However, those children who were exclusively breast-fed for at least 4 months had lower bone mass than children who were breast-fed while being allowed to eat other foods at the same time.   Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and its association with bone mineral density and serum parathyroid hormone levels during winter in urban males from Guiyang, Southwest China.  This observational study in adult men from Southwest China showed that circulating levels of vitamin D were generally low during the winter months.  It also found that when levels of vitamin D were adequate, or around 30 and 50 nmol/L, bone health tended to be better.   Maternal gestational vitamin D supplementation and offspring bone health (MAVIDOS): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that supplementing with vitamin D during pregnancy did not increase bone mineral content in the child.   10. Muscles and Physical Performance  Monthly High-Dose Vitamin D Treatment to Prevent Functional Decline.  This randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of supplementing with different amounts of vitamin D on physical function in people 70 years and older.  Three monthly doses were tested: 24,000 IU, 60,000 IU and 24,000 IU plus 300 µg of calcifediol . The study showed that a dose of 24,000 IU/month was more effective in improving physical function and reducing the risk of falls, compared to higher doses.   Effects of combined β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) and whey protein ingestion on symptoms of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.  This randomized trial examined the effects of supplementing with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), 3 grams/day, and whey protein, 36.6 grams/day, on markers of muscle damage after strength training.  The study showed that HMB and whey protein did not decrease soreness, the loss of muscle strength or markers of muscle damage, compared to supplementing with HMB or whey protein alone.   11. Allergies and Auto-Immune Disorders  Gluten Introduction and the Risk of Coeliac Disease: A Position Paper by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.  The time at which gluten is introduced into the diet of infants may affect their risk of developing gluten intolerance. This paper discusses the available evidence, which applies to infants who are genetically predisposed to developing gluten intolerance.  Based on observational data, infants should not eat gluten until they are at least 4 months old. Gluten should also be introduced slowly.   High-Fat and Low-Carbohydrate Diets Are Associated with Allergic Rhinitis But Not Asthma or Atopic Dermatitis in Children.  Allergic rhinitis , or hay fever, is characterized by an itchy, runny nose, as well sneezing and watery eyes. It is caused by an allergic reaction to particles in the air, such as dust or pollen.  This observational study in Korean children suggests that high-carb or high-fat diets may increase the risk of hay fever. Conversely, the study found no significant links between diet and asthma or eczema.   12. Infections and Immune Health  Role of Vitamin D in Hospitalized Children With Lower Tract Acute Respiratory Infections.  This observational study in hospitalized children with lung infections found that low levels of circulating vitamin D were linked with more severe infections.  However, it is unclear whether low levels of vitamin D made the infections worse, or if the infections depleted vitamin D levels. Randomized, controlled trials are needed.   13. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Maternal Serum Zinc Concentration during Pregnancy Is Inversely Associated with Risk of Preterm Birth in a Chinese Population.  This observational study in pregnant mothers in China indicates that high zinc levels may protect against preterm birth.   14. Men’s Health  Analysis of Gut Microbiome Reveals Significant Differences Between Men with Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome and Controls.  Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is a condition characterized by inflammation in the prostate. This inflammation may be caused by infections (prostatitis), but the majority of cases are due to unexplained, chronic inflammation.  This study showed that patients with CPPS have significantly lower diversity in the gut microbiota, compared to healthy people. The findings suggest that an imbalanced gut microbiota may be involved in CPPS.   15. Contaminants and Food Safety  Microbial Safety of Wood in Contact with Food: A Review.  Four basic groups of materials are generally used in food packaging: plastic, glass, metal and wood. Concerns have been raised that wood packaging may reduce food hygiene and safety.  However, this review concludes that wood is a safe material for food packaging. The rough surface of wood is unfavorable to microbes and may even contain anti-microbial substances that limit the growth of disease-causing bacteria.   16. Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Higher PUFA and n -3 PUFA, conjugated linoleic acid, α -tocopherol and iron, but lower iodine and selenium concentrations in organic milk: a systematic literature review and meta- and redundancy analyses.  This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that organic milk is, on average, higher in polyunsaturated fat, omega-3 fat, conjugated linoleic acid, vitamin E and iron, compared to milk that’s not produced according to organic standards.  However, organic milk was also significantly lower in iodine and selenium. Explaining this, cows tend to be grass-fed or pasture-raised on organic farms, whereas conventional farms more often use concentrated feeds based on grains and legumes.   Dietary intake and food contributors of polyphenols in adults and elderly adults of Sao Paulo: a population-based study.  This observational study suggests that coffee is the main source of antioxidant polyphenols in the diet of young and elderly adults in Brazil. Other significant sources of polyphenols were citrus fruits and tropical fruits.   Added sugar intake that exceeds current recommendations is associated with nutrient dilution in older Australians.  This observational study in elderly Australians found that a low intake of added sugar was linked with a higher intake of protein, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, fruit, vegetables, fish and alcohol.   Evidence from a Randomized Trial That Exposure to Supplemental Folic Acid at Recommended Levels during Pregnancy Does Not Lead to Increased Unmetabolized Folic Acid Concentrations in Maternal or Cord Blood.  High intake of folic acid from fortified food and supplements has been associated with elevated levels of un-metabolized folic acid (UFA) in the blood. There is some observational evidence linking high levels of UFA with increased cancer risk.  This randomized, controlled trial in pregnant women suggests that supplemental folic acid, at the recommended level of 400 µg/day, does not lead to increased levels of un-metabolized folic acid in the circulation or cord blood.

	For Food Addicts, Mood Affects Attention to Junk Food  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  March 2, 2016  Food addiction and emotional eating can lead to weight gain and obesity.  Recently, a group of researchers examined the effects of a sad film clip on women’s attention to images of food. The results recently appeared in Appetite .   Background  Certain types of food can be difficult or impossible to resist. These are usually high in sugar and fat.  For people with a food addiction, these foods are believed to act in a similar way to recreational drugs, activating the same brain centers ( 1 , 2 ).  In animals, studies have shown that eating a calorie-rich meal high in both sugar and fat leads to a surge of dopamine in the brain, providing a “feel good” effect ( 3 , 4 ).  Studies also suggest that obese individuals and people with eating disorders, such as binge eaters, may pay more attention to high-calorie food, compared to people who do not have these problems ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ).  Since food addiction has been linked to increased impulsiveness, this tendency may make it hard to maintain a healthy weight ( 9 ).  Food addiction is also closely linked to emotional eating. For some people, eating sweet, high-fat foods may be a way to cope with negative emotions ( 10 , 11 ).  Negative emotions may also trigger binges, and are linked with increased calorie intake among people with binge eating disorders ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ).  Article Reviewed  A team of researchers from the University of Calgary, in Canada, examined the effects of a sad film on attention to images of unhealthy foods among women with and without food addiction.  A sad mood increases attention to unhealthy food images in women with food addiction.  Study Design  This experiment examined the effects of a sad mood on attention to food among women with and without food addiction.  Before the experiment started, the researchers asked potential participants to complete online questionnaires, including the Yale Food Addiction Scale .  They then recruited 66 women, making sure that approximately half of them were likely food addicts. Only women were recruited for participation, since their food intake may be more affected by emotions than men’s ( 16 ).  All of the participants then went through the same tests, as described below:   Neutral Mood Induction (NMI): As a control, the participants were asked to watch a 5-minute film clip describing how to install an electrical power receptacle.  Attention Assessment: Attention was measured by recording the participants’ eye movements, using eye-tracking technology, while they were watching 25 sets of 4 images on a computer screen.  Sad Mood Induction (SMI): To make the participants sad, they watched a sad film clip about a young child who dies of cancer.  Attention Assessment: In the same way as before, the participants’ attention to images of food was measured by tracking eye movements.  Questionnaires: The participants completed two questionnaires: the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and the Emotional Eating Scale. Hunger and satiety were also self-rated.   During the attention assessment, each set of images was shown for 8 seconds. They displayed one unhealthy food, one healthy food and two non-food images.  Healthy foods were low in calories, such as fruit and vegetables. Unhealthy foods were high-calorie meats, sweets and salty snacks.  Between all of the steps, mood was assessed using two different questionnaires, in order to make sure the films were having the intended emotional effects.  Bottom Line: This study investigated how negative feelings, such as a sad mood, affect women’s attention to unhealthy foods.  Finding: Low Mood Increased Food Addicts’ Attention to Unhealthy Food Images  Both groups got equally sad after watching the sad film clip.  However, only women with a food addiction increased their attention to images of unhealthy foods after watching the film.  The chart below shows the differences in total fixation time, in milliseconds, between groups. Total fixation time refers to how long the participants looked at the images.   Similarly, the food addicts scored higher on all questionnaires related to food disorders.  Despite these findings, satiety and appetite remained similar in both groups.  Bottom Line: The study showed that women with food addiction paid more attention to food while they were sad. Women without food addiction did not respond in the same way.  Limitations  This study had a few minor limitations.  First, it only included young, Caucasian women. It is unclear how men, older women or other ethnicities would react.  Second, the study did not measure calorie intake. Future studies need to examine the effects of low mood on calorie intake.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study indicates that people with food addiction tend to pay more attention to high-calorie foods when they are sad.  For these people, eating may be a way to cope with negative emotions.  Although still unproven, it’s not implausible that a happy and stress-free life may help people keep their weight in check.

	Organic Meat is Higher in Omega-3 and Polyunsaturated Fat  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 29, 2016  There are many reasons why people choose to eat organic food.  Some people believe that organic food is more nutritious than non-organic food. Numerous studies have looked into this, but their results are mixed.  An international team of scientists reviewed the results of 67 studies on conventional vs organic meat. Their results were published in the British Journal of Nutrition .   Background  The popularity of organic food has increased over the past few decades, and there are two main explanations for this:   Environment: People choose organic food because of environmental concerns.  Health: People choose to eat organic food for health reasons.  Many people believe that organic foods contain lower amounts of contaminants or are richer in healthy nutrients.  However, studies have provided mixed results and there has been some debate as to whether eating organic food has any health relevance ( 1 ).  Article Reviewed  This paper presents the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis on differences in the fat content of organic meat and non-organic meat.  Composition differences between organic and conventional meat: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.  Study Design  The analysis included 67 studies published between 1992 and 2014. In 1992, the first organic farming regulations were introduced in the European Union.  Most of the included studies were from Europe, while rest were mainly from the US and Brazil.  The studies examined the nutritional content of various types of meat, but most of them focused on beef, lamb, goat, pork and chicken.  Three main types of studies were analyzed:   Comparison studies: Measurements of the nutritional content of meat from organic and non-organic farms in the same country or region.  Controlled experiments: Measurements of meat from experimental animals bred according to organic or conventional standards.  Basket studies: Measurements of organic and conventional meat from retail outlets.   The researchers mainly examined the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and omega-3 PUFAs, but the amount of other fats was also examined.  Bottom Line: This meta-analysis compared the fat content of organic meat and non-organic meat, focusing on polyunsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids.  Finding 1: Organic Meat is Higher in Polyunsaturated Fat  When all meat types were analyzed together, organic meat turned out to be 23% higher in polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), compared to non-organic meat.  However, when meat types were analyzed separately, significant differences in PUFA content were only found in chicken and pork.  This also applied to omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs. The levels of omega-6 were, on average, 16% higher in organic meat. Similarly, the levels of omega-3 were 47% higher in organic meat.  When the omega-3 content of individual meat types was analyzed separately, significant differences were detected in chicken meat only.  The study found no significant differences in individual PUFAs, such as EPA , DHA or CLA , or the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3.  Bottom Line: Organic meat contained significantly more polyunsaturated fat, compared to conventional meat. It also contained higher amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fat.  Finding 2: Organic Meat is Higher in Monounsaturated Fat  Organic meat was also 8% higher in monounsaturated fat .  When meat types were analyzed separately, monounsaturated fat levels were higher in pork and chicken only.  Conversely, the saturated fat content was similar in both organic and non-organic meat.  Bottom Line: Organic meat was significantly higher in monounsaturated fat, compared to non-organic meat.  Explanations  The nutrient content of meat ultimately depends on what the animal ate.  For this reason, the results of the present study are primarily explained by differences in feed or forage, although breed choice may also play a role.  Here are a few factors that may affect the fat content of meat:   Fresh forage: Pasture-raised or grass-fed meat contains higher levels of PUFAs and omega-3s. Animals on organic farms are often raised this way ( 2 , 3 ).  Type of forage: Organic farms often use a mixture of grass and clover, and clover-fed animals tend to have more omega-3s in their meat ( 4 , 5 ).  Concentrated feeds: Non-organic farms tend to use greater amounts of concentrated feeds based on grains or legumes, instead of pasture or grass ( 6 ).  Animal breed: Organic farmers may prefer more traditional breeds. Studies have shown that breed choice may affect the fat content of meat ( 2 ).   Bottom Line: The feed of animals on organic farms is often different from animals on non-organic farms, which affects the meat’s fat composition.  Limitations  Although the meta-analysis showed some significant differences between organic and non-organic meats, the individual studies provided mixed results.  For this reason, the strength of the evidence was estimated to be moderate. According to calculations, there was also some evidence for publication bias.  Otherwise, the meta-analysis itself appears to have been executed well.  Bottom Line: This meta-analysis seems to have been of high quality. However, the quality of the evidence was considered moderate, and the included studies provided mixed results.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that organic meat is, on average, significantly richer in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat, compared to non-organic meat.  This also applied to the levels of omega-3 and omega-6, whereas the ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 remained the same in both organic and non-organic meat.  The study’s authors speculate that eating organic meat may provide health benefits, especially if you eat a lot of meat.  However, randomized, controlled trials are required before any conclusions can be reached about the health relevance of these findings.  Tags: Meat , Omega-3 , Organic , Polyunsaturated fat

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Feb 19th–Feb 26th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 26, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, February 19th, to Friday, February 26th, 2016.   Research Reviews  We reviewed two articles in the past week: one from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , and the other from the Nutrition Journal .   Review:  Dieting Increases Appetite More than Exercising.  Article:  Energy depletion by diet or aerobic exercise alone: impact of energy deficit modality on appetite parameters.  Summary: This randomized, crossover study compared the effects of two different weight loss methods — dieting and exercising — on appetite and calorie intake.  The study showed that dieting led to greater increases in appetite and calorie intake, compared to exercising.   Review:  Collagen Supplements May Help Manage Osteoarthritis.  Article:  Efficacy and tolerability of an undenatured type II collagen supplement in modulating knee osteoarthritis symptoms: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Summary: This randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) on osteoarthritis symptoms.  The main findings were that UC-II reduced pain and stiffness and improved knee function, compared to a placebo or a mixture of glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate.   New Research From Around the World  Many new papers came to our attention during the past week. As usual, here are summaries of the most interesting or relevant studies:   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Arthritis  Inflammation  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Contaminants    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Effects of Moderate and Subsequent Progressive Weight Loss on Metabolic Function and Adipose Tissue Biology in Humans with Obesity.  This randomized, controlled trial compared the effects of different amounts of weight loss — 5%, 11% and 16% — on metabolic outcomes in obese individuals.  The study showed that a 5% weight loss improved insulin sensitivity in fat tissue, muscles and liver. Additional weight loss led to further improvements, such as reducing liver triglyceride content and oxidative stress.   High energy expenditure is not protective against increased adiposity in children.  This observational study suggests that energy expenditure during the first 6 years of life does not predict body weight when children are 8 years old.   No influence of sugar, snacks and fast food intake on the degree of obesity or treatment effect in childhood obesity.  This observational study in obese children showed that the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, candy, snacks and fast foods is not associated with the degree of obesity or the rate of weight loss several years afterwards.   Probiotics in prevention and treatment of obesity: a critical view.  This scientific review discusses the potential benefits of probiotics in the treatment of obesity. It concludes that probiotics may affect calorie intake, appetite, body weight and metabolic health by influencing the gut microbiota.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Folic Acid Supplement Intake in Early Pregnancy Increases Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Evidence From a Prospective Cohort Study.  Folic acid is a synthetic form of vitamin B9. Unlike folate, folic acid is not naturally present in food.  Previous studies have linked a high intake of folic acid with an increased risk of oral cleft malformations, asthma and cancer. This observational study suggests that supplementing with folic acid may increase the risk of diabetes during pregnancy.   No Effect of High-Dose Vitamin D Treatment on {beta}-Cell Function, Insulin Sensitivity, or Glucose Homeostasis in Subjects With Abnormal Glucose Tolerance: A Randomized Clinical Trial.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that high-dose D-vitamin supplementation — 30,000 IU per week for 8 weeks — does not affect blood sugar control in people with pre-diabetes or diet-treated type 2 diabetes.   Potato Consumption and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: Results From Three Prospective Cohort Studies.  This observational study suggests that eating a lot of potatoes, especially french fries, is linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.   Association of adherence to a Mediterranean diet with glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in youth with type I diabetes: the SEARCH Nutrition Ancillary Study.  This observational study indicates that following the Mediterranean diet may improve blood sugar control and heart health in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.   3. Heart Health  Prevalence of thiamine deficiency in a stable heart failure outpatient cohort on standard loop diuretic therapy.  Some previous studies indicate that up to 50% of patients with heart failure may have thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This percentage may even reach 96% among those who are hospitalized. However, the findings have been inconsistent.  This observational study of 30 patients attending a heart failure clinic suggests that thiamine deficiency is rare among heart failure patients, or less than 11.9%.   4. Cancer  Retrospective analysis of the influence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on disease progression and survival in pancreatic cancer.  This observational study found that 96% of patients with pancreatic cancer had low levels of vitamin D. However, the progression of the disease or survival rate were not linked with circulating levels of vitamin D.   Dietary acrylamide and the risk of endometrial cancer: An Italian case-control study.  Acrylamides are chemicals that form when some foods are cooked at high temperatures. In high amounts they may potentially cause cancer.  This observational study showed that dietary intake of acrylamides was not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer , which occurs in the uterus.   5. Appetite and Eating  A sad mood increases attention to unhealthy food images in women with food addiction.   This experiment suggests that women with food addictions are more prone to eating unhealthy foods when sad, compared to women without food addictions.   Reduced reward-driven eating accounts for the impact of a mindfulness-based diet and exercise intervention on weight loss: Data from the SHINE randomized controlled trial.  Many obese people have problems losing weight. This is because their eating behavior is reward-driven and often stress-related. However, mindful eating helps reduce these factors.  This randomized, controlled trial in obese individuals showed that an exercise program with mindfulness training reduced reward-driven eating behavior, promoting weight loss.   Brain imaging demonstrates a reduced neural impact of eating in obesity.  This study compared the effects of food on brain responses in lean and severely obese women. During fasting, brain activity remained similar in both groups.  However, after eating, the lean women showed significantly decreased brain activity, whereas the obese women didn‘t. Consistently, appeal ratings of food decreased only in lean women.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Chocolate intake is associated with better cognitive function: The Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study.  This observational study suggests that eating chocolate regularly may improve many aspects of mental function, such as memory and abstract reasoning.   Dietary diversity and 14-year decline in higher-level functional capacity among middle-aged and elderly Japanese.  This observational study suggests that high dietary diversity may improve intellectual capacity in middle-aged and older Japanese people.   7. Muscles and Physical Performance  HMB attenuates the cytokine response during sustained military training.  β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine, formed in the human body. It is also sold as a dietary supplement, since previous studies suggest that it may promote muscle growth and strength.  This randomized trial showed that supplementing with HMB, 3 grams per day for 23 days, reduced inflammation and improved muscle quality during intense training.   Oral L-citrulline supplementation enhances cycling time trial performance in healthy trained men: Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled 2-way crossover study.  Citrulline is an amino acid found in high amounts in watermelons. Previous studies suggest that supplementing with citrulline may reduce blood pressure and improve sports performance.  This randomized, crossover trial found that supplementing with L-citrulline, 2.4 grams per day for 7 days, reduced subjective ratings of fatigue after exercise and improved the time it took to complete a cycle ergometer exercise trial.   What is the Optimal Amount of Protein to Support Post-Exercise Skeletal Muscle Reconditioning in the Older Adult?  Eating protein increases muscle recovery and growth after strength exercise. This review discusses how much protein is needed to maximize these benefits.  In young adults, a single dose of 20 grams of high-quality protein may be enough to maximize muscle protein synthesis. On the other hand, this response seems to be blunted in older adults. They may require higher amounts, or around 40 grams.   8. Arthritis  Long-term effects of glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate on the progression of structural changes in knee osteoarthritis: 6-year follow-up data from the osteoarthritis initiative.  This observational study examined the long-term effects of supplementing with glucosamine (Glu) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) on changes in knee joint cartilage among people with knee osteoarthritis.  The results suggest that supplementing with Glu and CS may reduce the loss of knee cartilage if taken for several years.   9. Inflammation  Consumption of a healthy dietary pattern results in significant reductions in C-reactive protein levels in adults: a meta-analysis.  C-reactive protein (CRP) is found in blood. It is an inflammatory marker, meaning that its levels increase in response to inflammation in the body.  This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials concluded that following a healthy diet reduces the levels of CRP, improving chronic inflammation.   10. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Total Duration of Breastfeeding, Vitamin D Supplementation, and Serum Levels of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D.  This observational study found that the duration of breastfeeding was linked with lower circulating levels of vitamin D, especially if children were breastfed for more than 1 year. Supplementing with vitamin D reduced this risk.   11. Contaminants  Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in the Korean food basket and estimation of dietary exposure.  Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a flame retardant, mainly used in thermal insulation by the building industry. HBCD is a toxic, persistent, environmental contaminant that finds its way into the human food chain.  HBCD is toxic to neurons, disrupts thyroid hormones and may reduce fertility. This Korean study showed that HBCD is found in the highest amounts in animal-based foods, especially fish and shellfish.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Collagen Supplements May Help Manage Osteoarthritis  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 24, 2016  Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, characterized by the breakdown of cartilage within joints ( 1 ).  Pain killers or anti-inflammatory medications can help reduce symptoms, but their impact on arthritis is limited ( 2 ).  Dietary supplements containing collagen may also be effective. Recently, scientists examined the effects of undenatured type II collagen on symptoms of osteoarthritis.   Background  Type II collagen is found in articular cartilage , which helps the joints move smoothly and prevents the bones from rubbing together when you move.  Previous studies indicate that taking type II collagen supplements may reduce joint pain and stiffness for people who have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis ( 3 , 4 ).  However, the collagen in supplements is sometimes processed by heating. This type of collagen is referred to as denatured collagen, which may be less beneficial than undenatured collagen ( 5 ).  Undenaturated type II collagen (UC-II) is a patented dietary supplement produced from chicken cartilage.  Several previous studies have found that UC-II may significantly relieve symptoms in people with arthritis. Below is an overview of their findings from over the years:   2002: Taking 10 grams of UC-II for 42 days significantly reduced pain and morning joint stiffness ( 6 ).  2009: Supplementing with 40 grams of UC-II for 90 days improved symptoms of osteoarthritis by 33% — significantly more than glucosamine plus chondroitin ( 7 ).  2013: Supplementing with 40 grams of UC-II for 120 days improved knee joint mobility. However, joint pain did not decrease ( 8 ).   Article Reviewed  Scientists from Interhealth Nutraceuticals and the University of California examined the effects of UC-II supplements on knee osteoarthritis symptoms.  Efficacy and tolerability of an undenatured type II collagen supplement in modulating knee osteoarthritis symptoms: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Study Design  The purpose of this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was to examine the effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) on symptoms of knee osteoarthritis.  The study, which lasted for 180 days, was conducted at 13 research centers in southern India. The 191 participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:   UC-II: Participants took two capsules, containing 40 mg of a UC-II supplement, every day. This dose provided 1.2 mg of bioactive UC-II.  GC: This group took capsules containing a mixture of glucosamine hydrochloride (1500 mg) and chondroitin sulfate (1200 mg) each day.  Placebo: Participants in this group took a placebo, which had no effects on osteoarthritis.   At the beginning and end of the study, the researchers assessed the symptoms of osteoarthritis using the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).  Other measurements included knee mobility, joint function, subjective ratings of pain and circulating levels of inflammatory markers.  164 arthritic men and women completed the study, or 86% of those who started.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, controlled trial examining the effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) on osteoarthritis symptoms.  Finding 1: UC-II Improved Symptoms  Osteoarthritis symptoms were calculated from the results of the WOMAC questionnaire, which contains three subscales: pain, stiffness and knee function.  The score ranged from 0–2400, from no symptoms to severe pain and dysfunction.  Supplementing with UC-II improved the overall WOMAC score by 39%, significantly more than the placebo or GC. These results can be seen in the chart below.   When the subscales of the WOMAC were examined separately, UC-II significantly improved symptoms in all of them.  Conversely, participants in the GC group experienced no statistically significant improvements.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with UC-II, 40 mg/day for 180 days, significantly improved subjective ratings of knee osteoarthritis symptoms.  Finding 2: UC-II Improved Knee Joint Function  Knee joint function was estimated using the Lequesne Functional Index (LFI), which is a 10-question survey assessing pain, walking distance and activities of daily living.  The LFI score ranged from 0–24, from no symptoms to a severe condition.  For the participants who supplemented with UC-II, the LFI score improved by 37%, compared to the start of the study.  This improvement was significantly greater than in the GC group or the placebo group, which can be seen in the chart below.   These results were consistent with the results of the WOMAC questionnaire, which showed that supplementing with UC-II improved knee joint function by 39% and stiffness by 41%.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with UC-II significantly improved knee joint function and stiffness.  Finding 3: UV-II Reduced Knee Pain  Knee pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire, which included 7 pain-related questions.  Supplementing with UC-II improved ratings on the VAS scale by 39%. This was greater than both the GC group or the placebo, as shown in the chart below.   These results were supported by the pain subscale of the WOMAC questionnaire, showing a 41% reduction in knee pain.  However, despite improvements in pain, inflammatory markers did not decrease significantly.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with UC-II significantly improved knee joint pain, compared to the GC or placebo supplements.  Limitations  The study had a few potential limitations. First, the results were based on subjective ratings of symptoms, which are prone to bias.  Second, the study was solely funded by InterHealth Nutraceuticals, the company that owns the patent for UC-II.  Additionally, all study materials were supplied by Interhealth Nutraceuticals, and two of the paper’s authors were employees of the company.  However, the study was independently conducted by an Indian company, Laila Pharmaceuticals. Also, an independent statistician performed all analyses and calculations.  Although there is no specific reason to doubt the findings, the results should be confirmed by an independent research group.  Bottom Line: The study’s main limitation was a potential conflict of interest. However, apart from funding the study and writing the paper, independent partners conducted the study itself.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that supplementing with 40 mg (two capsules) of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) improved symptoms of osteoarthritis.  Specifically, UC-II improved knee function and reduced pain and stiffness.  Simply put, if you have osteoarthritis, taking UC-II could make a difference.  Tags: Arthritis , Collagen , Supplements

	Dieting Increases Appetite More than Exercising  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 22, 2016  There are two basic weight loss methods: diet and exercise. When used separately, it’s unclear how these methods affect appetite.  For this reason, a team of scientists examined how diet and exercise affect appetite. Their results were recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Background  Losing weight is hard. This is because your body doesn’t really want to lose weight, and uses several tricks to prevent this from happening.  One of them is to increase appetite and cravings to compensate for any lost weight.  However, previous studies suggest that losing weight by exercising may increase appetite and calorie intake less than dieting.  Several studies have also shown that calories lost via exercise are not completely restored by increased calorie intake afterward ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  On the other hand, dieting seems to have much stronger effects on appetite and calorie intake ( 4 , 5 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of scientists compared the effects of calorie depletion by dieting or exercising on appetite and calorie intake.  Energy depletion by diet or aerobic exercise alone: impact of energy deficit modality on appetite parameters.  Study Design  The purpose of this small, randomized, crossover study was to examine the effects of dieting or exercising on appetite, appetite hormones and food intake.  A total of 10 healthy, young and relatively fit men participated in the study.  The study started with a control period, during which the participants followed a standardized diet for three days.  The participants were then assigned to two groups in a random order:   Dieting: During this three-day, calorie-reduced diet, the participants consumed 25% fewer calories than they needed to maintain stable body weight.  Exercising: For three days, the participants did aerobic exercise. The amount of exercise was carefully adjusted so that the participants would burn 25% of the calories they needed to maintain stable body weight.   Since this trial had a crossover design, all participants exercised and dieted on different occasions, separated by a 2-week washout period.  At the beginning and end of each of the three study periods, the researchers measured appetite hormones (ghrelin and leptin). Calorie intake and appetite were measured only at the end of each of the three study periods.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, crossover study comparing the effects of dieting and exercising on appetite and calorie intake.  Finding 1: Dieting Promoted Greater Calorie Intake  Calorie intake increased significantly more after dieting, compared to exercising.  It was measured at a 30-minute buffet at the end of each of the three study periods. The findings are shown in the chart below.   Bottom Line: Calorie intake was significantly higher at the end of the dieting period, compared to both the control and exercising.  Finding 2: Dieting Led to a Greater Increase in Appetite  Dieting led to greater subjective ratings of appetite, compared to exercising, as assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire.  Specifically, the ratings of “desire to eat”, “hunger” and “prospective food consumption” (PFC) were significantly higher after dieting.  The chart below shows the differences between groups.   However, there were no significant differences in appetite hormones between groups.  Bottom Line: Subjective ratings of appetite were significantly higher after the dieting period, compared to exercising.  Limitations  This study appears to have been well designed and implemented. However, a few limitations should be mentioned.  First, it was a small, pilot study with a limited statistical power. Second, the study was of short duration. The long-term effects of dieting and exercising may be different.  Finally, the participants were all young, relatively fit and healthy men. The results might not apply to other groups of people.  Bottom Line: The study’s main limitations were its small size and short duration.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that if you want to lose weight, dieting may increase appetite more than exercising, resulting in higher calorie intake to make up for the calorie deficit.  However, it would be difficult to imitate this study’s tightly controlled setting in a real-life situation.  Nevertheless, if you want to lose weight, exercise may make a difference.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Feb 12th–Feb 19th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 19, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, February 12th, to Friday, February 19th, 2016.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two articles. One appeared in the European Journal of Nutrition , while the other was published in Cell Metabolism .   Review:  Khorasan Wheat is Healthier Than Modern Wheat.  Article:  A khorasan wheat-based replacement diet improves risk profile of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): a randomized crossover trial.  Summary: This randomized, crossover trial compared the health effects of modern wheat and Khorasan wheat.  The study showed that when wheat makes up about half of people’s daily calorie intake, replacing it with Khorasan wheat may improve blood sugar control, the blood lipid profile and antioxidant status.   Review:  Diet and Gut Microbiota in Inflammation and Disease.  Article:  The Intestinal Immune System in Obesity and Insulin Resistance.  Summary: This was a review summarizing the evidence linking obesity, dietary factors and the gut microbiota with intestinal inflammation, a weakened gut wall and metabolic diseases.   New Research From Around the World  As usual, we selected the most interesting or relevant papers that came out this week, briefly summarized their main findings and categorized them by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Kidney Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Infections and Immune Health  Inflammation  Skin Health  Sleep  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Relationship of sodium intake with obesity among Korean children and adolescents: Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  This observational study in Korean children and adolescents found that sodium intake tended to be higher among obese people than normal-weight people.   The causal role of breakfast in energy balance and health: a randomized controlled trial in obese adults.  This 6-week, randomized, controlled trial in obese adults showed that skipping breakfast reduced physical activity in the morning, and decreased insulin sensitivity later in the day.  It also resulted in greater calorie intake later in the day, partially compensating for the morning. However, it had no significant effects on body weight.   Timing of food intake is associated with weight loss evolution in severe obese patients after bariatric surgery.  Recent studies suggest that the timing of food intake may be important for weight loss. This study examined the effects of nutrient timing on weight loss after bariatric surgery .  During the 6-year follow-up after bariatric surgery, those who were late eaters lost less weight than those who were early eaters.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Vitamin D supplementation does not impact insulin resistance in black and white children.  Previous studies on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on blood sugar control and diabetes have provided inconsistent findings. However, few studies have examined whether supplementing with vitamin D has any effects in children.  This randomized, controlled trial in healthy, non-diabetic children showed that supplementing with vitamin D had no effects on blood sugar, insulin or insulin resistance.   3. Heart Health  Effects of sodium nitrite supplementation on vascular function and related small metabolite signatures in middle-aged and older adults.  Low amounts of nitric oxide (NO) may increase the risk of endothelial dysfunction , which is when the blood vessels are either too narrow or too dilated. Endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor for heart disease.  This randomized controlled study in middle-aged and older people showed that supplementing with sodium nitrite (a NO precursor), 80 to 160 mg/day for 10 weeks, improved arterial stiffening and endothelial function.   Sesame fractions and lipid profiles: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that eating sesame seeds significantly reduces triglyceride levels. However, it had no effects on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol.   Associations of egg and cholesterol intakes with carotid intima-media thickness and risk of incident coronary artery disease according to apolipoprotein E phenotype in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.  Coronary artery disease is when the blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen become clogged, increasing the risk of heart attacks.  This observational study suggests that dietary intake of cholesterol or eggs does not increase the risk of coronary artery disease.   Plasma trimethylamine N-oxide concentration is associated with choline, phospholipids, and methyl metabolism.  Previous observational studies suggest that high circulating levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) increase the risk of heart disease. The levels of TMAO increase after the consumption of foods that are rich in choline.  However, this only happens in people who have sufficient amounts of certain types of gut bacteria. This observational study showed that high levels of TMAO and choline were linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.   Intake of whole grains is associated with lower risk of myocardial infarction: the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort.  Myocardial infarction is another name for a heart attack. It happens when blood flow to the heart, or part of the heart, is disrupted.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of whole grains may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Whole-grain rye and oats may be especially beneficial.   4. Cancer  Association between dietary carbohydrate intake, glycemic index and glycemic load, and risk of gastric cancer.  This meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that a high intake of carbs, or a high average glycemic load, does not increase the risk of stomach cancer.  However, when men were examined separately, high carb intake significantly increased the risk of stomach cancer. The same also applied to people living in Asia.   5. Appetite and Eating  Common genetic architecture underlying young children’s food fussiness and liking for vegetables and fruit.  This study suggests that genetics may explain why some children are fussy when it comes to eating certain foods, such as fruits and vegetables.   Energy depletion by diet or aerobic exercise alone: impact of energy deficit modality on appetite parameters.  This small, randomized, crossover trial showed that losing weight by eating less caused a greater increase in appetite, compared to losing weight with exercise.  These findings indicate that exercising, without changing calorie intake, may be an easier way to lose weight than dieting.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Longitudinal diet quality is not associated with depressive symptoms in a cohort of middle-aged Australian women.  Previous studies indicate that dietary factors may affect depression. This study in Australian women suggests that diet quality, estimated using the Australian Recommended Food Score, does not significantly affect depression.   Acute effects of theanine, caffeine and theanine–caffeine combination on attention.  Theanine , found in green tea, is claimed to benefit attention and mood similar to caffeine. This controlled, crossover trial showed that I-theanine (200 mg) and caffeine (160 mg) improved attention to a similar degree.  The dose of theanine used was equivalent to eight cups of black tea. The combination of I-theanine and caffeine had even greater effects on attention.   Ketogenic and other dietary treatments for epilepsy.  Ketogenic diets are characterized by a high intake of protein and fat, and a very low intake of carbs. This causes the body to burn fat, rather than carbs.  This Cochrane review of randomized, controlled trials concludes that ketogenic diets show promising results for treating epilepsy. However, the quality of the evidence is poor, and more research is needed.   Concord grape juice, cognitive function, and driving performance: a 12-wk, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial in mothers of preteen children.  Previous studies have found that drinking Concord grape juice daily for 3–4 months may have benefits for memory and blood pressure.  This randomized, crossover trial in women showed that drinking 12 oz of grape juice per day, for 12 weeks, significantly improved memory and driving performance, compared to a placebo.   7. Kidney Health  Quercetin lowers plasma uric acid in pre-hyperuricaemic males: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.  Uric acid is a substance that forms when the body breaks down dietary purines. The kidneys are responsible for removing uric acid from the blood. However, some people may accumulate high levels of uric acid, potentially leading to gout .  This randomized, crossover trial showed that supplementing with quercetin, an antioxidant found in many fruits and vegetables, may lower circulating uric acid in men with high levels of uric acid.   8. Muscles and Physical Performance  No effect of acute beetroot juice ingestion on oxygen consumption, glucose kinetics, or skeletal muscle metabolism during submaximal exercise in males.  Some previous studies suggest that beetroot juice, which is rich in nitrate, may improve endurance by reducing the need for oxygen.  This randomized, crossover trial found no effects of beetroot juice on oxygen need, blood sugar or insulin during exercise in men.   Whey protein, amino acids, and vitamin D supplementation with physical activity increases fat-free mass and strength, functionality, and quality of life and decreases inflammation in sarcopenic elderly.  This was a 12-week, randomized, controlled trial in elderly people with low muscle mass who were on a strength exercise program.  It found that taking whey protein (22 g), essential amino acids (10.9 g) and vitamin D (100 IU) increased lean mass and strength more than a placebo.   9. Infections and Immune Health  Zinc as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of severe pneumonia in children <5 years: a meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that supplementing with zinc does not help treat severe pneumonia in young children receiving antibiotics.   Elevated lead levels and adverse effects on natural killer cells in children from an electronic waste recycling area.  Lead is a toxic heavy metal that may adversely affect your immune system. This study found high levels of lead in preschool children living near an electronic waste recycling center in China.  High circulating lead levels were associated with lower amounts of natural killer cells, which fight against tumors and viruses.   10. Inflammation  Prospective association between the Dietary Inflammatory Index and mortality: modulation by antioxidant supplementation in the SU.VI.MAX randomized control trial.  Chronic inflammation is an underlying condition of diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Our diet contains many substances that are either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory.  This observational study showed that when people’s diets had a low inflammatory potential, evaluated using the Dietary Inflammatory Index, they were at a reduced risk of death from all causes.   11. Skin Health  Vitamin D and Atopic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a chronic skin condition characterized by itchy, dry and red skin.  This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that supplementing with vitamin D may help reduce atopic dermatitis. However, high-quality human studies of long duration are lacking.   12. Sleep  Higher-protein diets improve indexes of sleep in energy-restricted overweight and obese adults: results from 2 randomized controlled trials.  These randomized, controlled trials showed that high-protein diets may improve sleep in overweight and obese adults following a calorie-reduced diet.   13. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Fish oil supplementation from 9 to 18 months of age affects the insulin-like growth factor axis in a sex-specific manner in Danish infants.  This randomized trial in infants showed that supplementing with fish oil increased circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in boys, but not girls, when compared to sunflower oil.  Levels of IGF-1 were linked with higher body mass index and height.   14. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Apple intake is inversely associated with all-cause and disease-specific mortality in elderly women.  This observational study in elderly women suggests that eating apples reduces the risk of death from all causes. It was also associated with less risk of cancer. Total fruit intake and banana intake was linked with reduced risk of heart disease.   15. Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals  Including whey protein and whey permeate in ready-to-use supplementary food improves recovery rates in children with moderate acute malnutrition: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.  This randomized trial found that adding whey protein and whey permeate to supplementary food increased recovery rates in malnourished African children, compared to a peanut-based food with soy protein.   Calcium intake and mortality from all causes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease: the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort.  This observational study suggests that a high dietary intake of calcium may reduce the risk of death from all causes in women.  However, when intake of calcium was higher than 1,000 mg/day, it increased the risk of all-cause death and death from heart disease in men.   Dietary antioxidant capacity and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the E3N/EPIC cohort study.  This observational study indicates that a high intake of antioxidants may reduce the risk of death from all causes, especially among smokers.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Diet and Gut Microbiota in Inflammation and Disease  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 17, 2016  Emerging evidence links chronic intestinal inflammation with obesity and metabolic disorders like insulin resistance.  What’s more, this association seems to be affected by changes in the gut microbiota caused by diet.  Recently, a group of researchers summarized the available evidence in a review published in Cell Metabolism . Below is an overview of the review’s main points.   Article Reviewed  This article discusses the association of intestinal inflammation, obesity, metabolic syndrome, the gut microbiota and dietary factors.  The Intestinal Immune System in Obesity and Insulin Resistance.  What is Inflammation?  Inflammation is the immune system’s response to infection, injury or toxins. There are two types of inflammation: acute inflammation and chronic inflammation.  Acute inflammation  Acute inflammation starts immediately after an injury or infection.  Its purpose is to eliminate foreign substances or invaders, such as bacteria or viruses, as well as to remove dead or injured cells that are no longer functional.  Although it causes the swelling and redness associated with wounds and infections, it is an essential process that helps the body heal and protects it against further harm.  Chronic inflammation  Chronic inflammation lasts longer than acute inflammation. For this reason, it damages living tissue. This increases the risk of diseases like cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  Many conditions may lead to chronic inflammation, including infection, toxin exposure, autoimmune diseases, age, high blood sugar levels or an unhealthy diet.  Low-grade, chronic inflammation is an underlying condition in obesity, insulin resistance and many other conditions.  Bottom Line: There are two types of inflammation: acute and chronic. Acute inflammation is a beneficial process, while chronic inflammation is associated with obesity and metabolic diseases.  Obesity is Associated With Dysbiosis  Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with dysbiosis , a term that refers to an imbalance in the gut microbiota ( 1 ).  Some scientists even believe that dysbiosis plays a key role in the development of obesity.  This idea is supported by animal studies, showing that mice without any bacteria in their intestines had lower amounts of body fat, and did not become obese or insulin resistant when put on a high-fat diet.  However, when the intestines of these same mice were colonized by gut bacteria from normal mice, they started to gain fat and develop insulin resistance ( 2 , 3 ).  What’s more, intestinal bacteria from obese mice increased fat gain more than bacteria from lean mice ( 1 ).  Consistently, killing the intestinal bacteria of obese mice with an antibiotic treatment reduced body fat and improved insulin sensitivity ( 4 , 5 ).  However, obese people should not resort to taking antibiotics, as there are other, healthier approaches. Human studies have shown that weight loss may restore gut microbiota balance and improve metabolic health ( 6 , 7 ).  Bottom Line: Different types of bacteria are predominant in obese people’s guts. These bacteria make it easier for them to absorb calories and gain fat.  Dysbiosis May Cause Intestinal Inflammation  Studies indicate that obesity-associated dysbiosis may promote weight gain. This is because obese people may have greater numbers of bacteria that improve calorie absorption.  Dysbiosis also seems to be characterized by low numbers of beneficial, anti-inflammatory bacteria.  These bacteria feed on fiber, especially prebiotic fiber, and produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate . Butyrate improves colon health and reduces inflammation.  For this reason, a lack of butyrate-producing bacteria may promote intestinal inflammation.  Transferring gut bacteria from lean, healthy donors to those with metabolic syndrome increased the butyrate-producing bacteria, which improved insulin sensitivity ( 8 ).  This also seems to be related to diet, in that obese people tend to have lower bacterial diversity and richness in their guts. However, one study showed that bacterial diversity can be restored by eating less ( 9 , 10 ).  Bottom Line: An imbalance in the microbiota of obese individuals may lead to intestinal inflammation. This imbalance is characterized by low numbers of beneficial, anti-inflammatory bacteria.  Dysbiosis May Weaken the Gut Wall  Intestinal permeability is an essential function of the gut wall. It allows nutrients to pass across the gut barrier into the blood circulation.  But the gut barrier should not be too permeable, since it needs to prevent potentially harmful substances from entering the body.  However, excessive intestinal permeability is an unfortunate consequence of dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation.  This leads to the leakage of bacteria or bacterial toxins across the gut barrier, worsening systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. This condition is called metabolic endotoxemia ( 4 , 11 , 12 ).  Endotoxemia is associated with high calorie intake, high intake of saturated fat, abdominal obesity and an increased risk of diabetes ( 13 , 14 ).  Conversely, getting enough fiber might help prevent endotoxemia by increasing the numbers of beneficial bacteria and strengthening the gut barrier ( 15 ).  Nevertheless, further studies are needed before any solid conclusions can be reached.  Bottom Line: Dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation may also increase intestinal permeability, allowing harmful substances to “leak” across the gut barrier. This may worsen inflammation and metabolic disorders.  Dietary Factors Affect Intestinal Inflammation  Intestinal inflammation is not only associated with dysbiosis and a “leaky gut.” All of this also appears to be linked to dietary habits.  Dietary factors that may worsen intestinal inflammation include:   A diet high in saturated fat: A diet high in saturated fat has been associated with intestinal inflammation in mice. This effect appears to be mediated by the gut microbiota, since bacteria-free mice showed no effects ( 16 , 17 , 18 ).  Food emulsifiers: Another mouse study suggests that two commonly-used food emulsifiers may change the gut microbiota and worsen inflammation ( 19 ).   Other dietary factors may protect against inflammation:   Losing weight: One human study showed that losing weight reduced intestinal inflammation, while also improving blood sugar levels and blood lipids ( 20 ).  Omega-3 fatty acids: A study in mice found that saturated fats from lard increased inflammation, whereas polyunsaturated fats from fish oil protected against inflammation ( 16 ).  Probiotics: Several types of probiotic bacteria may reduce intestinal inflammation and strengthen the gut barrier ( 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ).  Antioxidants: Antioxidant polyphenols from fruits and vegetables may also reduce inflammation ( 26 ).  Prebiotic fiber: Eating plenty of prebiotic fiber encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria that produce anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate ( 27 ).   Several studies have also examined the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on intestinal inflammation and metabolic conditions.  Apart from reducing inflammation, anti-inflammatory drugs may improve insulin sensitivity, decrease fasting blood sugar, reduce endotoxemia and increase gut bacterial diversity, without any effects on body weight ( 28 , 29 , 30 ).  Taken together, these findings support the idea that diet-induced inflammation plays a key role in the development of chronic diseases in obesity.  Bottom Line: Dietary factors may either worsen or improve intestinal inflammation. Many of these effects seem to be mediated by the gut microbiota.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Obesity and many metabolic disorders are associated with chronic intestinal inflammation. Dietary factors and the gut microbiota also play a key role.  Fortunately, dietary strategies may be able to prevent or reduce these problems. These strategies may also improve many obesity-related metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance.  Effective strategies include losing weight, eating omega-3s, and taking prebiotic fiber and probiotics.  Tags: Gut microbiota , Inflammation , Obesity

	Khorasan Wheat is Healthier Than Modern Wheat  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 15, 2016  Modern wheat has been criticized for being less nutritious than older varieties.  In fact, emerging evidence indicates that ancient Khorasan wheat is healthier than modern wheat ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  To expand the evidence base, a group of scientists examined the health effects of Khorasan wheat on people with type 2 diabetes.  Their results were recently published in the European Journal of Nutrition .   Background  Modern wheat is a key component of many people’s diets.  However, a few previous studies suggest that modern wheat may be less nutritious than older varieties like spelt, emmer, einkorn or Khorasan wheat ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Recently, a few human trials have focused on Khorasan wheat, also called Kamut. Khorasan wheat is an ancient type of wheat with grains that are larger than those of modern wheat.  Three randomized trials, all done by the same research group, have shown that Khorasan wheat may have health effects that are superior to modern wheat.  One 6-week trial in men and women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) showed that eating Khorasan wheat instead of modern wheat reduced inflammation and improved symptoms of IBS ( 3 ).  Another randomized trial in patients with heart disease found that a diet based on Khorasan wheat improved blood lipids, blood sugar control, inflammatory factors and antioxidant status, compared to modern wheat ( 2 ).  Finally, a trial in healthy individuals showed that Khorasan wheat had favorable effects on heart disease risk factors such as blood lipids, blood sugar, inflammatory markers and antioxidant status ( 1 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of Italian researchers compared the health effects of diets based on modern wheat and Khorasan wheat in people with type 2 diabetes.  A khorasan wheat‑based replacement diet improves risk profile of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): a randomized crossover trial.  Study Design  This was a randomized, crossover trial examining the health effects of modern wheat and Khorasan wheat in people with type 2 diabetes.  A total of 21 diabetic men and women, with an average age of 64, participated in the study. The participants were assigned to two groups, in random order:   Khorasan wheat: This 8-week diet was based on wheat products made using organic, KAMUT® Khorasan wheat. The flour used was semi-whole.  Modern wheat: This 8-week control diet was based on wheat products made using organic, modern wheat. The flour used was semi-whole. Specifically, this was a mix of modern durum wheat and soft wheat varieties.   In both groups, the participants’ weekly consumption of wheat products included 500 grams of pasta, 250 grams of crackers and 250 grams of biscuits. Additionally, they ate 150 grams of bread each day.  The wheat products accounted for 50–55% of the participants’ daily calorie intake. Since the study had a crossover design, all participants were in both groups on different occasions, separated by 8 weeks.  At the start and end of the study, the researchers measured fasting blood sugar, insulin, blood lipids, inflammatory markers and antioxidant status.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, crossover trial examining the effects of replacing modern wheat with Khorasan wheat on blood sugar control and heart disease risk factors.  Finding 1: Khorasan Wheat Improved Blood Sugar Control  Eating Khorasan wheat reduced fasting levels of blood sugar by 9.1% and insulin by 16.3%, whereas modern wheat had no effects.  The difference between groups was significant only for insulin. The chart below shows the changes in blood sugar and insulin in both groups.   The researchers also estimated insulin sensitivity, which improved significantly when the participants consumed Khorasan wheat, compared to modern wheat.  These results are supported by two previous studies in healthy people and patients with heart disease ( 1 , 2 ).  Bottom Line: Consuming Khorasan wheat significantly improved fasting levels of blood sugar and insulin.  Finding 2: Khorasan Wheat Reduced LDL-Cholesterol  Replacing modern wheat with Khorasan wheat improved the blood lipid profile, reducing levels of total cholesterol by 3.7% and LDL-cholesterol by 3.4%.  In contrast, the diet that contained modern wheat seemed to increase total and LDL cholesterol levels slightly, although the effect was not statistically significant.  Two previous studies also support these results ( 1 , 2 ).  Bottom Line: Khorasan wheat improved cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, compared to modern wheat.  Finding 3: Khorasan Wheat Improved Antioxidant Status  Previous studies have shown that high levels of blood sugar may impair antioxidant status, increasing the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS).  In the present study, eating Khorasan wheat significantly improved antioxidant status, whereas eating modern wheat had no significant effects.  In fact, Khorasan wheat improved total antioxidant capacity by 6.3%, and also reduced levels of ROS.  However, there were no significant differences between groups.   These findings are supported by a previous study examining the health effects of Khorasan wheat in healthy individuals ( 1 ).  Bottom Line: Eating Khorasan wheat significantly improved antioxidant status. However, there were no significant differences between groups.  Limitations  This study appears to have been designed and implemented well. Nonetheless, a few potential limitations should be mentioned.  First, the study size was small, which limits its statistical power.  Additionally, the paper doesn’t mention the fiber content of the wheat flours used in the study. Yet fiber is highly relevant, since it can affect various health markers.  Finally, the study was supported by a grant from Kamut Enterprises of Europe , which also provided the Khorasan wheat used in the study. However, the authors declared no conflicts of interest.  Bottom Line: This paper had a few limitations, including lack of information on the fiber content of the diets. Additionally, the study was funded by a company that sells Khorasan wheat.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that when modern wheat accounts for about half of people’s daily calorie intake, replacing it with Khorasan wheat may have multiple health benefits.  These results are supported by a few previous studies by the same research group, and they were all funded by a Khorasan wheat producer. Although this does not discount the results, they should be confirmed by an independent research group.  If you want to improve your health, replacing your wheat with other fiber-rich grains may help. Khorasan wheat appears to be a good choice.  Tags: Blood sugar , Wheat

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Feb 5th–Feb 12th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 12, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, February 5th, to Friday, February 12th, 2016.   Research Reviews  As usual, we reviewed two articles this week. One was published in Nutrition & Diabetes , while the other appeared in the British Journal of Nutrition .   Review:  Low-Fat Foods Are Higher in Sugar.  Article:  A systematic comparison of sugar content in low-fat vs regular versions of food.  Summary: This study found that reduced-fat or fat-free foods contain greater amounts of sugar than their full-fat versions.   Review:  Eating Dairy May Reduce Heart Disease Risk.  Article:  Dairy consumption and CVD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Summary: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies examining the association of dairy products and heart disease.  The study suggests that eating dairy products may reduce the risk of heart disease, coronary heart disease and stroke.   New Research From Around the World  Tons of new research came out this week. We have selected the most interesting or relevant papers and categorized them by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney Health  Bone Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Women’s Health  Longevity and Healthy Aging  Contaminants  Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Vitamin D supplementation trial in infancy: body composition effects at 3 years of age in a prospective follow-up study from Montréal.  This observational study suggests that better vitamin D status from infancy to age three is associated with a reduced risk of weight gain and obesity.   Breakfast consumption and adiposity among children and adolescents: an updated review of the literature.  This review indicates that eating breakfast may help prevent excessive weight gain and obesity in children and adolescents. However, the quality of the evidence is poor, and higher-quality studies are needed.   Long-term association between dairy consumption and risk of childhood obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  This observational study indicates that dairy consumption reduces the risk of excessive weight gain and obesity among children.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Circulating retinoic acid levels and the development of metabolic syndrome.  Retinoic acid is the active form of vitamin A in the body.  This observational study in Chinese people suggests that high circulating levels of retinoic acid may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, independently of obesity and insulin resistance.   The Intestinal Immune System in Obesity and Insulin Resistance.  Obesity and insulin resistance are linked with chronic inflammation in fat tissue and the liver. Emerging evidence suggests that this inflammation may be mediated by the gut microbiota.  For this reason, some scientists have speculated that the gut microbiota may be responsible for the inflammation in obesity and metabolic syndrome. This review takes a look at the evidence.   3. Diabetes and Blood Sugar Control  Meal sequence and glucose excursion, gastric emptying and incretin secretion in type 2 diabetes: a randomised, controlled crossover, exploratory trial.  This randomized controlled trial showed that eating either fish or meat before a rice dish helped improve blood sugar control.   Association between alcohol consumption and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that light and moderate alcohol consumption may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, heavy drinking was not associated with type 2 diabetes.   A khorasan wheat-based replacement diet improves risk profile of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): a randomized crossover trial.  This randomized, crossover trial found that eating khorasan wheat reduced fasting levels of LDL-cholesterol, insulin and glucose. In comparison, eating products made from modern, semi-whole wheat flour did not improve any of these health factors.   Difference in postprandial GLP-1 response despite similar glucose kinetics after consumption of wheat breads with different particle size in healthy men.  This randomized, crossover trial compared the effects of two types of fiber-rich breads that differed in their fiber particle sizes. To obtain bread with high fiber particle sizes, the researchers replaced some of the flour with broken wheat kernels.  Blood sugar increased similarly after both types of bread. However, the increase in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was much lower after the kernel bread. GLP-1 is a hormone that promotes insulin production and sensitivity.   Effect of meal frequency on glucose and insulin levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomised trial.  This randomized, controlled trial in women with polycystic ovary syndrome examined the effects of meal frequency on blood sugar and insulin levels. It showed that six meals per day improved the results of an oral-glucose tolerance test.  Conversely, meal frequency did not have any effects on blood sugar, HbA1c, blood lipids, appetite or satiety.   4. Heart Health  Causal Role of Alcohol Consumption in an Improved Lipid Profile: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.  This observational study suggests that low to moderate alcohol consumption may improve the blood lipid profile.   Effects of vitamin D supplementation on endothelial function: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials.  Endothelial function refers to the condition of the inner lining of the blood vessels. When the endothelium is dysfunctional, the tiny muscles lining the blood vessels make them either too narrow or too dilated.  This systematic review and meta-analysis concludes that supplementing with vitamin D does not improve endothelial function.   Sugar-sweetened beverage intake and its associations with cardiometabolic risks among adolescents.  This observational study in Malaysian adolescents suggests that drinking lots of sugar-sweetened beverages may impair heart health.   Acute benefits of the microbial-derived isoflavone metabolite equol on arterial stiffness in men prospectively recruited according to equol producer phenotype: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.  Daidzein is an isoflavone found in soy products. In the colon, daidzein is changed into equol by intestinal bacteria. However, this only happens in about 30% of people in Western countries, since specific types of equol-producing bacteria are required.  Equol has been associated with several health benefits. This randomized controlled trial showed that eating soy reduced the stiffness of arteries in equol-producers. Reduced arterial stiffness is associated with a lower risk of heart disease.   Fish, long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and incidence of atrial fibrillation: a pooled analysis of two prospective studies.  Atrial fibrillation is a type of abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), characterized by fast or irregular heartbeats. It is a risk factor for stroke and heart attacks.  This observational study suggests that eating a lot of fish or omega-3 polyunsaturated fats does not protect against atrial fibrillation. However, high consumption of lean fish was associated with a lower risk.   Taurine Supplementation Lowers Blood Pressure and Improves Vascular Function in Prehypertension: Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.  Taurine is an organic acid found in animal products, such as fish, meat and dairy. This randomized, controlled trial in people with moderately elevated blood pressure (pre-hypertension) showed that supplementing with taurine reduced blood pressure.   Association of overweight and obesity with patient mortality after acute myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.  This observational study in overweight and obese individuals suggests that being overweight reduces the risk of death after a heart attack.  A similar association has been reported before, and is called the obesity paradox. However, this is controversial and not all previous studies agree.   5. Cancer  Dietary total antioxidant capacity is inversely associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness in a population-based study.  This observational study indicates that eating a lot of antioxidant-rich foods may reduce the risk of aggressive prostate cancer.   Visceral obesity is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Visceral obesity refers to the excessive accumulation of fat inside the abdominal cavity. This observational study indicates that high levels of visceral obesity may reduce survival among patients with pancreatic cancer.   Bladder cancer is associated with low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in Tunisian population.  This observational study shows that circulating levels of vitamin D are low in Tunisian patients with bladder cancer.   Dietary Intake of One-Carbon Metabolism–Related Nutrients and Pancreatic Cancer Risk: The Singapore Chinese Health Study.  One-carbon metabolism is a process involved in the repair and synthesis of the genetic code (DNA), and the control of gene expression. Several nutrients are essential in this process. These include folate, vitamin B12, B6, B2 and choline.  This observational study examined whether any of these nutrients reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer. The findings suggest that higher intake of vitamin B6 and choline may be protective.   6. Appetite and Eating  How much sugar do consumers add to plain yogurts? Insights from a study examining French consumer behavior and self-reported habits.  Many French consumers add sugar to sweeten plain yogurts before they eat them. The participants in this study added 13.6 grams of sugar to their yogurt, on average.  This is higher than the 10.2 grams (per 125 grams) manufacturers usually add to their sugar-sweetened yogurts. The study also showed that consumers underestimate the amount of sugar they use.   To eat or not to eat: Effects of food availability on reward system activity during food picture viewing.  This experiment examined people’s brain activity when they were looking at foods that differed in their calorie content or availability.  The study showed that high-calorie foods that are immediately available caused a stronger response in the reward centers of the brain, compared to lower-calorie foods, or foods that were not immediately available.   Weight stigma and eating behaviours in elementary school children: A prospective population-based study.  Restrained eating refers to abstaining or avoiding certain foods, ingredients or food groups. On the other hand, external eating refers to the inability to resist certain foods when they are immediately available.  This study showed that weight stigma and body dissatisfaction were associated with restrained eating and external eating in elementary school girls. Body dissatisfaction also had similar effects on restrained eating in boys, whereas weight stigma did not.   Effect of extended morning fasting upon ad libitum lunch intake and associated metabolic and hormonal responses in obese adults.  This randomized, controlled trial in 24 obese men and women showed that skipping breakfast did not increase calorie intake at a subsequent pasta lunch. What’s more, it did not seem to increase appetite in the afternoon.  However, morning fasting reduced the levels of satiety hormones during the lunch. It also reduced the levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin in the afternoon.   7. Brain and Mental Health  Antioxidants as add-on treatment for people with schizophrenia.  This Cochrane review showed that most studies have not found any links between dietary antioxidant intake and schizophrenia. However, there was some evidence that Ginkgo biloba had beneficial, short-term effects on psychotic symptoms.   8. Digestive Health  Randomized clinical study: Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) versus placebo in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.  Guar gum is a type of dietary fiber made from guar beans. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a well-known prebiotic fiber that increases the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon.  This randomized, controlled trial in patients with irritable bowel syndrome showed that supplementing with PHGG, 6 grams per day for 12 weeks, significantly reduced bloating.   Titanium dioxide nanoparticles exacerbate DSS-induced colitis: role of the NLRP3 inflammasome.  Titanium dioxide is used in the production of paint, plastics, paper, toothpaste, pills and tablets. It is also used as a white food colorant in products such as cheese, sauces and sweets.  This study indicates that titanium dioxide may worsen symptoms in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.   Oral versus intravenous iron replacement therapy distinctly alters the gut microbiota and metabolome in patients with IBD.  Previous studies have shown that iron deficiency is a common problem in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, supplementing with iron may worsen IBD symptoms.  This randomized trial in healthy people and patients with IBD showed that supplementing with iron significantly changed the composition of the gut microbiota, especially in IBD patients. The health relevance of this is unclear.   Glutamine for treatment of active Crohn’s disease.  Crohn’s disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease, characterized by stomach pain, diarrhea and weight loss. Animal studies indicate that glutamine , an amino acid important for intestinal health, may help treat CD.  This Cochrane review concludes that studies do not support the use of glutamine supplements in people with Crohn’s disease. However, further studies are needed before any solid conclusions can be reached.   9. Kidney Health  Synbiotics Easing Renal Failure by Improving Gut Microbiology (SYNERGY): A Randomized Trial.  Previous studies indicate that certain toxins, mainly indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), impair kidney function. What’s more, some researchers suggest that these toxins are due an imbalanced gut microbiota.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with chronic kidney disease showed that supplementing with both probiotics and prebiotics significantly reduced levels of PCS, but not IS.   10. Bone Health  Sodium Intake and Osteoporosis. Findings from the Women’s Health Initiative.  This observational study indicates that sodium intake is not associated with an increased risk of fractures or osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.   11. Muscles and Physical Function  Dietary Protein Intake Is Protective Against Loss of Grip Strength Among Older Adults in the Framingham Offspring Cohort.  The age-related loss of muscle mass is an important health issue among older people. Previous studies have shown that increased protein intake may help maintain muscle mass, but the effects of protein on strength are less clear.  This observational study suggests that high intake of protein may help maintain grip strength in people aged 60 years or older.   Protein intake and lean body mass preservation during energy intake restriction in overweight older adults.  Weight loss not only leads to loss of fat mass, but also muscle. However, increased protein intake may help reduce muscle loss.  This randomized trial in overweight, older adults showed that increasing protein intake above the habitual intake levels of 0.9 grams/kg/day (about 2 grams/lb/day) did not preserve lean mass or strength during a 12-week calorie-reduced diet.   12. Women’s Health  Dietary fat intake and reproductive hormone concentrations and ovulation in regularly menstruating women.  A growing number of studies indicate that certain types of fat may improve fertility in women.  This observational study showed that a high intake of omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid was associated with higher progesterone levels and a lower risk of anovulation, which is when the ovaries fail to release eggs for more than three months.   13. Longevity and Healthy Aging  Adherence to Dietary Guidelines and Successful Aging Over 10 Years.  This observational study showed that a greater adherence to official dietary guidelines is associated with an increased chance of healthy aging.   Fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause mortality: evidence from a large Australian cohort study.  This observational study in 150,969 adults, aged 45 years and over, suggests that eating lots of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of death from all causes.   14. Contaminants  Dietary and lifestyle determinants of acrylamide and glycidamide hemoglobin adducts in non-smoking postmenopausal women from the EPIC cohort.  Acrylamide is a contaminant classified as “probably carcinogenic” in humans. It forms in starchy foods that are exposed to high heat.  This observational study suggests that food products, such as cookies, crackers and dry cakes, are the strongest determinants of circulating acrylamide in non-smoking, postmenopausal women in Europe.   15. Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals  Does Replacing Sodium Excreted in Sweat Attenuate the Health Benefits of Physical Activity?  This review concludes that replacing salt lost in sweat during exercise may improve physical performance, but possibly decrease the long-term health benefits of physical activity.   What is the safe upper intake level of folic acid for the nervous system? Implications for folic acid fortification policies.  This review discusses the safe upper intake levels of folic acid, and the risks associated with getting too much of it.  It points out that there is evidence of neurological damage from the long-term intake of folic acid, ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg per day, in people who suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency.

	Eating Dairy May Reduce Heart Disease Risk  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 10, 2016  Many studies indicate that dairy products may protect against heart disease ( 1 ).  To expand and update the evidence base, a team of researchers conducted a meta-analysis, combining the results of 31 previous observational studies.  Below is a detailed overview of their results, recently published in the British Journal of Nutrition .   Background  Many studies suggest that dairy products may protect against heart disease. Yet most of the available evidence is based on observational studies, which can’t prove causation ( 1 ).  On the other hand, some scientists have suggested that high-fat dairy containing saturated fat may increase the risk of heart disease by raising LDL-cholesterol ( 2 , 3 ).  This is controversial, since dairy products have also been shown to raise HDL-cholesterol and reduce blood pressure ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ).  What’s more, emerging evidence indicates that saturated fat does not increase heart disease risk — its effect may simply be neutral ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ).  Other studies suggest that milk fat may have different effects on risk factors for heart disease, depending on what dairy product it comes from ( 11 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers from EpidStat Institute, USA, did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies examining the association of dairy products and heart disease.  Dairy consumption and CVD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Study Design  This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies examining the association between dairy products and heart disease.  A total of 31 prospective cohort studies, including over one million adults, were selected using strict inclusion criteria.  A prospective cohort study is a type of observational study that follows individuals over time, investigating how certain factors affect the rates of a certain outcome.  In the present meta-analysis, the included studies assessed dairy consumption using food frequency questionnaires. They then followed the participants for 5â26 years, while recording all heart disease events.  Outcome values included:   Heart disease: Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are collectively known as heart disease, or cardiovascular disease. This includes conditions such as heart attacks, coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke.  Coronary heart disease (CHD): This disease is characterized by the clogging of the blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen. It may eventually lead to heart attacks or heart failure.  Stroke: Also known as brain attack, stroke is when blood flow in the brain is interrupted, leading to cell death. This may be caused by clogged or ruptured blood vessels.   In addition to examining the association of total dairy intake with heart disease, the researchers divided dairy products into categories and did sub-analyses on each of the groups.  These categories included milk, cheese, yogurt, calcium from dairy products, low-fat dairy and full-fat dairy.  Bottom Line: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association of dairy consumption with heart disease, coronary heart disease and stroke.  Finding 1: Eating Dairy Reduced the Risk of Heart Disease  This study suggests that total dairy intake is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, coronary heart disease and stroke.  In fact, the reduction in risk may be as high as 5â15%, regardless of fat content.  Additionally, there were no significant differences between intake levels. One serving per day appeared to be as beneficial as three servings.  These results are also supported by previous meta-analyses on the association of dairy products with heart disease, coronary heart disease and stroke ( 1 ).  Bottom Line: Total dairy consumption was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, coronary heart disease and stroke.  Finding 2: Eating Cheese Reduced the Risk of Heart Disease  Previous studies indicate that eating fermented dairy products, such as cheese, may protect against heart disease ( 12 ).  The present study supports earlier findings, suggesting that cheese may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 18% and stroke by 13%.  All levels of intake appeared to be protective.  Bottom Line: Eating cheese was significantly associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.  Additional Findings  Several additional findings were reported, including:   No benefits from milk: Drinking milk was not associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, coronary heart disease or stroke.  Calcium reduced stroke risk: Calcium from dairy products was not significantly linked with coronary heart disease. However, it was associated with an estimated 31% reduction in the risk of stroke, on average.  Yogurt is inconclusive: Due to lack of data, the study couldn’t form any conclusions about the effects of consuming yogurt. More studies are needed.   Bottom Line: Milk consumption was not associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, whereas dairy calcium seemed to protect against coronary heart disease. The effects of eating yogurt are still unclear.  Limitations  This systematic review and meta-analysis appears to have been well planned and implemented. Nevertheless, it has one important limitation: it used data from observational studies, which can’t prove causation.  For example, people who eat a lot dairy products may simply have healthier lifestyle habits, compared to those who eat less dairy.  However, most of the studies included in this meta-analysis adjusted for dietary and lifestyle factors, and other studies have consistently reported similar associations.  This indicates that the observed associations are at least partly due to the direct effects of dairy consumption on heart disease risk.  Finally, it would have been interesting if the study had looked into the effects of different dairy fats. For example, butter appears to raise LDL-cholesterol to a greater extent than cream, as discussed in our previous research review ( 11 ).  Bottom Line: This study was both well planned and implemented. However, it was based on observational studies, which can’t prove a cause-and-effect relationship.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study suggests that consuming dairy products may reduce the risk of heart disease, coronary heart disease and stroke.  Among the different types of dairy products, cheese seems to be an especially good choice.  Simply put, eating dairy appears to be healthy for your heart and blood vessels.

https://authoritynutrition.com/research/low-fat-foods-are-high-in-sugar/
	Low-Fat Foods Are Higher in Sugar  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 8, 2016  Many people believe that low-fat foods are generally higher in added sugar than the original full-fat versions.  Although this is highly plausible, it has never been scientifically confirmed.  For this reason, a group of Californian scientists decided to systematically compare the sugar content of several common full-fat foods with their lower-fat alternatives.  Below is a detailed summary of their findings, recently published in Nutrition & Diabetes .   Background  In the late 70’s, public health authorities started recommending reduced fat consumption.  In response to increased consumer demands, food producers started offering low-fat or fat-free versions of foods.  However, this may not have been a step in a healthier direction. First, fat may not be as unhealthy as it was made out to be.  Second, food producers may have intentionally increased the sugar content of some processed food products to make up for the lack of tastiness caused by reducing their fat content.  This may have adversely affected people’s health, since sugar promotes obesity and chronic disease ( 1 , 2 ).  Article Reviewed  This article presents the results of a systematic comparison of the sugar content of full-fat and reduced-fat versions of common foods.  A systematic comparison of sugar content in low-fat vs regular versions of food.  Study Design  The purpose of this simple study was to compare the sugar content of common foods and their fat-reduced versions.  The selection of foods was based on a list of foods recommended by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute .  This was a list of high-calorie, high-fat foods along with “healthier”, low-fat alternatives. The nutrient content of these foods was obtained from the USDA Nutrient Database .  Finally, the researchers used statistics to compare the sugar content in 100 grams of the regular, low-fat and non-fat versions of the selected foods.  Bottom Line: This study compared the sugar content of the regular, low-fat and non-fat versions of several common foods.  Finding: Lower-Fat Means Higher-Sugar  The study found that low-fat versions of foods were, on average, higher in sugar.  Additionally, the study showed a significant difference in the sugar content of the regular and low/non-fat versions of the following food groups:   Dairy products.  Meat, fish and poultry.  Baked goods, including snacks and sweets.  Fats, oils and salad dressings.   The difference was usually small, as shown in the chart below. It shows the median sugar content (g) of the regular, low-fat (“light”) and non-fat versions of foods within the four food groups.   Bottom Line: The study showed that full-fat versions of foods are lower in sugar than their low-fat or fat-free alternatives.  Limitations  The results of this study were presented as a “short communication”, including minimal details on the study’s methods and results.  For this reason, it is difficult to assess the study’s limitations. However, a few potential shortfalls should be mentioned.  First, it compared the sugar content of a limited number of foods.  Second, when you remove fat from a food product, such as milk, the relative proportions of protein, carbs and sugar increase.  This may create a statistically significant difference in the sugar content of full-fat and lower-fat foods, even if they do not contain any added sugar.  Third, the USDA Nutrient Database does not distinguish between added sugar and sugar that’s naturally present in whole foods.  The researchers did not address these potential limitations.  Bottom Line: This study had a few potential limitations. For example, it did not distinguish between added sugar and sugar that is naturally present in foods.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Gram for gram, there is no doubt that low-fat foods contain higher amounts of sugar than full-fat versions.  There are two possible reasons for this:   The relative proportion of sugar increases when fat is removed.  Food producers add more sugar to low-fat and fat-free products.   The present study does not distinguish between these two possibilities.  Whether people should chose full-fat or low-fat versions of foods depends entirely on their nutrient composition.  For example, choosing a low-fat food product may be good if it means that you are getting more protein without a large increase in sugar.  On the other hand, if it means that you’re getting a lot more sugar, then it is probably healthier to stick to the regular, full-fat version.  Tags: Low-fat , Sugar

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Jan 29th–Feb 5th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 5, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, January 29th, to Friday, February 5th, 2016.   Research Review  This week, we reviewed two articles. One was published in Obesity , while the other appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Review:  Fast Weight Loss Does Not Promote Weight Regain.  Article:  The Effect of Rate of Weight Loss on Long-Term Weight Regain in Adults with Overweight and Obesity.  Summary: This was a randomized trial examining how the rate of weight loss, or the degree of calorie reduction, affects weight regain after dieting.  The study showed that the rate of weight loss didn’t have any effects on later weight regain. However, faster weight loss caused a greater loss of lean mass, suggesting that the weight loss quality may be lower.   Review:  Protein and Exercise May Prevent Muscle Loss While Dieting.  Article:  Higher compared with lower dietary protein during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss: a randomized trial.  Summary: This was a randomized, controlled weight-loss trial comparing the effects of two calorie-reduced diets. One provided 35% of calories from protein, while the other provided 15% of calories from protein.  Both groups were also doing high-intensity strength exercises. The study found that the higher-protein group retained more of their lean mass than the lower-protein group. Simply put, the higher-protein diet increased weight loss quality.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new research came out this week. Here is a summary of the most important papers, organized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney Health  Immune Health  Bone and Joint Health  Skin Health  Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Long-Term Supplementation of Green Tea Extract Does Not Modify Adiposity or Bone Mineral Density in a Randomized Trial of Overweight and Obese Postmenopausal Women.  Previous studies have associated green tea extract with weight loss and improvements to bone mineral density (BMD). Yet it is unknown which of the active components of green tea are responsible for these effects.  This 12-month, randomized, controlled trial in overweight or obese women showed that taking decaffeinated green tea extract, containing 843 mg of the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate , had no effects on body weight or BMD.   Polygenic Risk, Appetite Traits, and Weight Gain in Childhood.  Genetic traits play an important role in weight gain and obesity, among both children and adults. This observational study indicates that obesity-promoting genetic traits do not influence weight gain through increased appetite in children.   Microbial transmission from mothers with obesity or diabetes to infants: an innovative opportunity to interrupt a vicious cycle.  The risk of obesity and diabetes is increased for children whose mothers were obese or diabetic, which may be due to inherited intestinal bacteria.  This review discusses the possible role of the gut bacteria in this association. It also talks about the factors that affect the development of the gut microbiota in infants.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Vitamin D 20,000 IU per Week for Five Years does not Prevent Progression from Prediabetes to Diabetes.  Previous observational studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.  This randomized, controlled trial in pre-diabetics showed that supplementing with vitamin D, 20,000 IU per week for 5 years, did not prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.   Association between the change in body mass index from early adulthood to midlife and subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus.  This large observational study in 120,666 people suggests that high body mass index (BMI) and weight gain in early adulthood may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes after midlife, regardless of current BMI.   Artificially Sweetened Beverage Consumption Is Positively Associated with Newly Diagnosed Diabetes in Normal-Weight but Not in Overweight or Obese Brazilian Adults.  Previous animal studies indicate that drinking beverages with artificial sweeteners may increase the risk of diabetes.  This observational study in 12,884 Brazilians found that drinking high amounts of artificially sweetened beverages was associated with diabetes and higher blood sugar levels. However, this did not apply to obese or overweight individuals.   High Fiber and Low Starch Intakes Are Associated with Circulating Intermediate Biomarkers of Type 2 Diabetes among Women.  This observational study suggests that eating high amounts of fiber, and low amounts of starch, may improve blood sugar control. Only cereal fiber was associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation.   3. Heart Health  Plasma Concentrations of Trimethylamine-N-oxide Are Directly Associated with Dairy Food Consumption and Low-Grade Inflammation in a German Adult Population.  High blood levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are associated with heart disease. This observational study suggests that dairy products may increase TMAO levels, and high levels of TMAO may also increase inflammation.   Garlic and Heart Disease.  This scientific review looked at randomized, controlled trials examining the effects of garlic on risk markers for heart disease. It concluded that garlic supplementation has the potential to prevent heart disease.   Garlic-Derived Organic Polysulfides and Myocardial Protection.  Garlic contains many healthy plant compounds, such as polysulfides like diallyl disulfide . This scientific review discusses the available evidence linking diallyl polysulfides from garlic with reduced heart disease risk.   Consumption of Caffeinated Products and Cardiac Ectopy.  Cardiac ectopy (CE) is a condition characterized by a disturbance or irregularities in the heart beat, often described as heart hiccups, jolts or missed beats. CE has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.  This observational study found no significant links between consuming caffeinated foods, such as coffee, tea and chocolate, and CE.   Dietary {alpha}-Linolenic Acid, Marine {omega}-3 Fatty Acids, and Mortality in a Population With High Fish Consumption: Findings From the PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea (PREDIMED) Study.  This observational study suggests that eating a lot of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), mainly from olives and walnuts, reduces the risk of death from all causes.  However, only the intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish was associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease.   Plasma {alpha}-Linolenic and Long-Chain {omega}-3 Fatty Acids Are Associated with a Lower Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Singapore Chinese Adults.  Consuming long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) has consistently been associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks. On the other hand, studies on the association of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) with heart attacks are inconsistent.  This observational study in Chinese adults indicates that high circulating levels of ALA and n-3 PUFAs are associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks.   Plasma Glycine and Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Suspected Stable Angina Pectoris.  Glycine is an amino acid found in proteins. Several observational studies have linked low circulating levels of glycine with obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.  This observational study suggests that low levels of glycine increase the risk of heart attacks in patients with chest pain.   Serum Magnesium and the Risk of Death From Coronary Heart Disease and Sudden Cardiac Death.  This observational study indicates that low circulating levels of magnesium increase the risk of heart disease and sudden death from a heart attack.   Habitual chocolate consumption and the risk of incident heart failure among healthy men and women.  Heart failure occurs when the heart is not able to pump enough blood throughout the body to meet the body’s needs. This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that eating chocolate does not reduce the risk of heart failure.   Aged Garlic Extract Reduces Low Attenuation Plaque in Coronary Arteries of Patients with Metabolic Syndrome in a Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Study.  Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries, the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart. It is characterized by fat accumulation (plaque buildup) on their inner surface, and they may eventually become clogged.  This randomized trial in patients with metabolic syndrome showed that supplementing with aged garlic extract, 2,400 mg per day for 41 days, reduced non-calcified plaques on the inside of the heart arteries.   Garlic Lowers Blood Pressure in Hypertensive Individuals, Regulates Serum Cholesterol, and Stimulates Immunity: An Updated Meta-analysis and Review.  This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that eating garlic may lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. It may also reduce blood cholesterol and strengthen the immune system.   Eating frequency predicts new onset hypertension and the rate of progression of blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and wave reflections.  This observational study suggests that those who eat very often may be at an increased risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.   The effects of alcohol on ambulatory blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes: a randomized intervention.  This randomized, controlled trial in 24 men and women with type 2 diabetes showed that drinking red wine, 230–300 ml/day for 4 weeks, increased blood pressure, compared to drinking an equal amount of water.  De-alcoholized red wine did not have similar effects, although there was a non-significant trend towards higher blood pressure when it was compared to water.   Effect of weight loss induced by energy restriction on measures of arterial compliance: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis of human trials showed that weight loss causes improvements in the health of the blood vessels (arteries) that carry blood from the heart. These changes may reduce the risk of heart disease.   Energy-restricted, high-protein diets more effectively impact cardiometabolic profile in overweight and obese women than lower-protein diets.  This 6-month, randomized trial in overweight and obese women found that a calorie-reduced diet providing 35% of calories from protein caused greater improvements in metabolic health, and heart disease risk factors, than a lower-protein diet.  Specifically, the higher protein diet caused greater improvements in the blood lipid profile and insulin sensitivity.   Dairy consumption and CVD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that consuming dairy products may be associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.   4. Cancer  Suppression of Proinflammatory and Prosurvival Biomarkers in Oral Cancer Patients Consuming a Black Raspberry Phytochemical-Rich Troche.  This human trial showed that eating black raspberries caused some beneficial changes in the cells lining the mouth. Further studies are needed to confirm if this leads to a reduced risk of mouth cancer.   Chemopreventive Effects of Alpha Lipoic Acid on Obesity-Related Cancers.  Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of certain cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, colon, thyroid and liver cancer.  This review discusses the potential role of alpha-lipoic acid in the prevention of obesity-related cancers. Alpha-lipoic acid is a type of fat naturally found in the body, but is also sold as a dietary supplement.   Dietary carbohydrate intake, glycaemic load, glycaemic index and ovarian cancer risk in African-American women.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of sugar may increase the risk of ovarian cancer in African-American women.   5. Appetite and Eating  Associations between Meal and Snack Frequency and Diet Quality in US Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2012.  This observational study examined the diet quality of participants in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, using the Healthy Eating Index-2010.  The findings suggest that both higher meal frequency and snack frequency are associated with a healthier diet or better diet quality.   The effect of academic stress and attachment stress on stress-eaters and stress-undereaters.  Stress may affect your eating habits. Some people are likely to increase their calorie intake when they are under stress, whereas others eat less. This experiment suggests that different types of stress affect eating in different ways.   Keeping Pace with Your Eating: Visual Feedback Affects Eating Rate in Humans.  Eating at a slower rate increases fullness and has been associated with weight loss. Conversely, eating fast is linked with weight gain and obesity.  This experiment indicates that eating rate is affected by visual feedback. For example, when soup disappears faster or slower than expected, people change their eating rate accordingly.   6. Brain and Mental Health  The role of diet and nutritional supplementation in perinatal depression: a systematic review.  This systematic review concludes that there are no consistent links between diet and depression during or after pregnancy.   Association of Seafood Consumption, Brain Mercury Level, and APOE ε4 Status With Brain Neuropathology in Older Adults.  This observational study examined the association of seafood consumption, brain mercury levels and Alzheimer’s disease in elderly people.  The study showed that eating fish, seafood and fish oil was associated with higher levels of mercury in the brain. However, seafood reduced the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and brain mercury was not associated with brain disorders.   Vitamin D Supplementation Affects the Beck Depression Inventory, Insulin Resistance, and Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.  This was a randomized, controlled trial in patients with a major depressive disorder. It showed that taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D each week for 8 weeks improved depression and blood sugar control, while reducing oxidative stress.   Dietary Patterns High in Red Meat, Potato, Gravy, and Butter Are Associated with Poor Cognitive Functioning but Not with Rate of Cognitive Decline in Very Old Adults.  This observational study in elderly people suggests that a diet high in red meat, potatoes, gravy and butter may increase the risk of a mental decline. However, it was not associated with the speed at which these changes occurred.   The Association of Maternal Obesity and Diabetes With Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities.  This observational study suggests that women who are obese and diabetic before pregnancy are at an increased risk of having children with autism and/or intellectual disabilities.   Cross-sectional association between serum concentrations of n -3 long-chain PUFA and depressive symptoms: results in Japanese community dwellers.  This observational study in Japanese people indicates that high circulating levels of long-chain omega-3 fats, EPA and DHA, may protect against depression.   7. Digestive Health  Fungal microbiota dysbiosis in IBD.  Previous studies have shown that many diseases are associated with an imbalance in the gut microbiota.  This study found that the fungal microbiota is imbalanced in people with inflammatory bowel disease. Specifically, there was a higher proportion of Candida albicans and a lower proportion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , compared to healthy people.   Dietary Milk-Fat-Globule Membrane Affects Resistance to Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in Healthy Adults in a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study.  Dairy fat is enclosed in a layer called the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). However, this does not apply to all dairy fat. The process used to make butter destroys most of the MFGM.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that eating the MFGM increased resistance to a strain of E. coli , a bacterium that may cause mild food poisoning and diarrhea.   Human Milk Oligosaccharides and Synthetic Galactosyloligosaccharides Contain 3′-, 4-, and 6′-Galactosyllactose and Attenuate Inflammation in Human T84, NCM-460, and H4 Cells and Intestinal Tissue Ex Vivo.  The intestines of infants are prone to becoming inflamed, but human milk seems to reduce this risk. This test tube experiment suggests that a type of sugar, galactosyllactose, may contribute to this anti-inflammatory effect.   8. Kidney Health  Resistant starch for modulation of gut microbiota: Promising adjuvant therapy for chronic kidney disease patients?  Many diseases, including chronic kidney disease, have been associated with a gut microbiota that is different from that of healthy people. Certain types of fiber, called prebiotics, can help restore a healthy balance in the gut microbiota.  This review discusses the effects of resistant starch, a type of prebiotic, on the gut microbiota in patients with chronic kidney disease.   9. Immune Health  Aged Garlic Extract Modifies Human Immunity.  This review discusses the way garlic may improve immune health. It concludes that supplementing with aged garlic extract may enhance the function of immune cells, partly explaining why garlic consumption may reduce the severity of cold and flu.   10. Bone and Joint Health  Efficacy and tolerability of an undenatured type II collagen supplement in modulating knee osteoarthritis symptoms: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) is a type of nutritional supplement used to treat arthritis. This randomized, controlled trial examined its effects on osteoarthritis, which is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that supplementing with UC-II, 40 mg per day for 6 months, significantly improved symptoms in people with osteoarthritis in the knees, compared to a placebo.   11. Skin Health  Ingestion of bioactive collagen hydrolysates enhance facial skin moisture and elasticity and reduce facial aging signs in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study.  Human blood contains two main collagen peptides: prolyl-hydroxyproline (PH) and hydroxyprolyl-glycine (HG). Previous test tube experiments indicate that these peptides may improve skin health.  This 8-week, randomized, controlled trial supports earlier studies, suggesting that supplementing with PH and HG may enhance skin moisture and elasticity while reducing wrinkles and roughness.   12. Vegan and Vegetarian Diets  Food and Nutrient Intake and Nutritional Status of Finnish Vegans and Non-Vegetarians.  This study in Finnish vegans and non-vegetarians showed that vegans had a lower intake of vitamin B12 and vitamin D, compared to non-vegetarians. Vegans also had lower circulating levels of vitamin D, iodine and selenium.  However, the blood lipid profile of vegans was significantly more favorable, and they had much higher levels of antioxidant isoflavones, mostly derived from soy products.   13. Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals  Genetics, Diet, and Season Are Associated with Serum 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol Concentration in a Yupik Study Population from Southwestern Alaska.  People living in high-latitude areas, which get little sunlight during the winter months, are at an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency.  This observational study of native people in Alaska showed that vitamin D levels were affected by season, gender and whether they lived inland or by the coast. The traditional diet also protected against vitamin D deficiency.   Consumption of a calcium and vitamin D-fortified food product does not affect iron status during initial military training: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Previous studies suggest that calcium and vitamin D supplements may reduce the risk of fractures during initial military training. However, calcium may interfere with iron absorption.  In contrast to previous studies, this randomized, controlled trial indicates that calcium and vitamin D supplements do not affect iron status.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Protein and Exercise May Prevent Muscle Loss While Dieting  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 3, 2016  Dieting often results in the loss of both fat and muscle mass.  Strength exercises and protein can help prevent the loss of muscle mass, yet studies disagree on how much you need.  A recent study examined these effects. Below is a detailed summary of their results, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Background  When you are on a calorie-reduced diet, loss of lean body mass may contribute to 20–30% of the total body weight you lose ( 1 ).  Lean body mass, also known as fat-free mass, is a measure of body composition. It is basically all of the body mass — water, bones and muscles — minus the fat.  The loss of lean body mass during dieting is mainly due to loss of muscle, but water may be lost as well ( 2 ).  Maintaining your muscle mass is very important for overall health. Fortunately, several strategies may help, including ( 3 ):   Eating enough protein ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Doing intense strength exercises ( 7 ).  Supplementing with high-quality protein, such as whey ( 8 ).   Article Reviewed  A group of researchers from McMaster University, Canada, examined the effects of high protein intake on body composition during a calorie-reduced diet combined with high-intensity strength exercise.  Higher compared with lower dietary protein during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss: a randomized trial.  Study Design  This 4-week, randomized, controlled trial examined whether the amount of protein eaten on a calorie-reduced diet during an intense strength exercise program would affect changes in body composition.  A total of 40 overweight young men followed a calorie-reduced diet, providing 60% of their calorie requirements, or 33 kcal for every kg (about 2.2 lbs) of lean body mass.  They also had exercise sessions on 6 days of the week, which involved strength training and high-intensity interval training.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups:   High-protein diet: This diet provided 35% of calories from protein, 50% from carbs and 15% from fat. Daily protein intake was 2.4 g per kg of body weight.  Control diet: This diet provided 15% of calories from protein, 50% from carbs and 35% from fat. Daily protein intake was 1.2 g per kg of body weight.   The amount of protein in the control diet was similar to what many people normally get from their diet. In the high-protein group, however, the protein intake was 3 times higher than the recommended daily allowance.  All food was provided by the study kitchen. Participants in both groups also received beverages containing whey protein.  One of the protein beverages was consumed immediately after exercise, whereas the rest were consumed throughout the day.  At the start and end of the study, the researchers measured body composition.  Bottom Line: This was a 4-week, randomized, controlled trial examining the effects of a high-protein diet on changes in body composition during a calorie-reduced diet combined with strength exercises.  Finding 1: High Protein Intake Increased Lean Mass  Lean body mass increased significantly in the high-protein group, while it remained unchanged in those who got lower amounts of protein.  The chart below shows the differences between groups.   In both groups, lean muscle mass was preserved, despite significant weight loss.  This is supported by a previous study in overweight and obese women showing that a high-protein diet, providing 30% of calories from protein, increased lean mass during a calorie-reduced diet and a strength exercise program ( 6 ).  Bottom Line: The study showed that 1.2 g of protein/kg/day combined with strength exercises prevented loss of lean mass during a calorie-reduced diet. Higher amounts of protein, 2.4 g/kg/day, increased lean mass.  Finding 2: High Protein Intake Caused Greater Fat Loss  Participants in both groups lost significant amounts of fat. In fact, the participants’ weight loss was solely fat loss, while lean body mass was preserved.  This fat loss was significantly greater in the high-protein group, compared to the control group, as shown in the chart below.   These findings are strongly supported by previous studies showing that high-protein diets increase fat loss and preserve lean mass ( 9 ).  Bottom Line: The high-protein diet significantly reduced fat mass, compared to the lower-protein diet.  Limitations  This study was well designed and implemented, and appears to have no obvious limitations.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that supplementing with protein and doing high-intensity exercise prevented muscle loss and increased fat loss during a calorie-reduced diet.  What’s more, these strategies also significantly increased muscle mass.  If you want to improve the effectiveness of your dieting, consider eating more protein and doing some strength exercises.  This can help you retain your muscle mass, increasing the quality of your weight loss and improving your overall health.  Tags: Exercise , Muscle mass , Protein

	Fast Weight Loss Does Not Promote Weight Regain  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  February 1, 2016  To successfully lose weight and keep it off, you usually need to change your lifestyle.  Short-term dieting doesn’t work in the long-term, since most people just gradually gain the weight back again. What’s more, some people have suggested that fast weight loss may cause even greater weight regain.  For this reason, researchers from the Netherlands compared weight regain after rapid and slow weight loss. Their findings were recently published in Obesity .   Background  Weight regain after dieting is a well-known problem. Two human trials showed that one year after dieting, only 20% of the subjects had avoided weight regain ( 1 , 2 ).  Another study found that two years after dieting the participants had, on average, regained approximately 70% of the weight they lost ( 3 ).  A widely held belief is that fast weight loss causes people to regain more body fat later on, but this has not been scientifically proved ( 4 , 5 ).  The idea seems scientifically plausible, due to low protein intake and a loss of muscle mass, which are explained below:   Low protein intake: Fast weight loss comes from following very low-calorie diets. These diets contain lower amounts of protein.  Loss of muscle mass: Eating very little protein increases muscle mass loss, reducing calories burned and making it harder to keep weight off ( 6 , 7 ).   However, previous studies have found no evidence that fast weight loss leads to more weight regain, when compared to more gradual weight loss ( 3 , 8 ).  Article Reviewed  This article describes the findings of a randomized trial comparing the effects of fast and slow weight loss on weight regain after dieting.  The Effect of Rate of Weight Loss on Long-Term Weight Regain in Adults with Overweight and Obesity.  Study Design  The purpose of this randomized trial was to examine whether losing weight fast has any effects on weight regain after dieting stops.  A total of 61 overweight or obese men and women started the study. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Slow weight loss: A 12-week, low-calorie diet, aiming for 10% weight loss. Each day, it provided 1,250 kcal, 90 g protein, 150 g carbs and 32 g fat.  Fast weight loss: A 5-week, very-low calorie diet, aiming for 10% weight loss. Each day, it provided 500 kcal, 52 g protein, 52 g carbs and 8 g fat.   After the calorie-reduced diet, the participants went on a 4-week weight maintenance diet. Their weight regain was then monitored for 9 months after they stopped dieting.  At the start and end of each of the study periods, the researchers measured body weight and composition.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized trial examining how the rate of weight loss affects weight regain after dieting.  Finding 1: Rate of Weight Loss Did Not Affect Regain  In both groups, the participants lost similar amounts of body weight, ranging from 18–20 lbs (8–9 kg), on average.  During the 9-month follow-up period, 75% of the participants gained back more than 50% of their lost weight.  This weight regain was similar in both groups, as shown in the chart below.   These results are supported by previous studies showing that fast and slow weight loss resulted in similar weight regain ( 3 , 8 ).  Bottom Line: The study showed that the rate of weight loss does not affect weight regain after dieting stops.  Finding 2: Fast Weight Loss Reduced Lean Mass  One of the downsides of dieting is the loss of lean mass, which is a measure of the body’s fat-free mass — muscles, bones and water.  The amount of muscle mass you have is a strong determinant of how many calories your body burns ( 6 , 7 ).  In the present study, losing weight fast led to more lean mass loss.  The chart below shows the differences between groups, presenting lean mass loss as a percent of total weight loss.   Losing weight fast caused a 1.3 lbs (0.6 kg) greater loss of lean mass, compared to a more moderate weight loss approach.  Additionally, loss of lean mass was associated with greater weight regain in both groups. However, this was not enough to cause a significant difference in weight regain between groups.  Bottom Line: Fast weight loss led to a greater lean mass loss, which was significantly associated with weight regain in both groups. However, this was not enough to cause differences in weight regain between groups.  Limitations  This study was both well designed and implemented, and did not seem to have any serious limitations.  Its main weakness was the method used to assess lean mass, as it did not allow the researchers to distinguish between body water and muscle mass.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that losing weight fast did not affect weight regain after dieting stopped.  However, fast weight loss had one downside. It caused a greater reduction in lean mass, compared to slower weight loss.  Even though fast weight loss does not affect weight regain, a more gradual weight loss approach is probably a better option, since it may help you retain muscle mass.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Jan 22nd–Jan 29th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 29, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, January 22nd, to Friday, January 29th, 2016.   Research Review  We reviewed two research articles in the past week: one from the European Journal of Nutrition , and the other from Advances in Nutrition .   Review:  Very High Amounts of Fat May Reduce Insulin Sensitivity.  Article:  A high‑fat, high‑saturated fat diet decreases insulin sensitivity without changing intra‑abdominal fat in weight‑stable overweight and obese adults.  Summary: This small, randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of a high-fat diet and a low-fat diet on insulin sensitivity.  The study indicates that a diet very high in fat lowers insulin sensitivity. However, the results may not be of much relevance in a real-life setting, because the amounts of fat on the high-fat diet far exceeded normal intakes.   Review:  Changes in Gut Bacteria Are Linked to Diet and Disease.  Article:  Can We Prevent Obesity-Related Metabolic Diseases by Dietary Modulation of the Gut Microbiota?  Summary: This review article provides an overview of the evidence linking the gut bacteria with obesity, metabolic diseases and diet.   New Research From Around the World  Numerous papers came out this week, many of which were published ahead of print.  As usual, we provide a summary of the most interesting or relevant papers, organized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Metabolic Syndrome  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney Health  Lung Health  Immune Health  Healthy Aging and Longevity  Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Whole grain consumption trends and associations with body weight measures in the United States: results from the cross sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001–2012.  This observational study showed that those who eat the highest amounts of whole grains in the US are less likely to be overweight or obese. Also, they have better nutrient and fiber intakes.   The effect of rate of weight loss on long-term weight regain in adults with overweight and obesity.  This randomized trial examined whether the speed of weight loss has any effects on weight regain after dieting stops.  Weight regain was similar among those who lost weight rapidly and those who had a slower weight loss. However, losing weight rapidly caused a greater reduction in lean mass, which was associated with weight regain later on.   Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption Is Associated With Change of Visceral Adipose Tissue Over 6 Years of Follow-Up.  This observational study suggests that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages increases people’s chance of gaining fat in the abdominal cavity (visceral fat). Drinking diet soda had no such effects.   Higher compared with lower dietary protein during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss: a randomized trial.  This randomized trial compared the effects of high and low protein intake on changes in mass during 4 weeks of intense exercise and 40% calorie reduction.  Supplementing with high amounts of protein, 2.4 grams/kg (about 2.2 lbs) per day, caused greater fat loss and a higher gain in lean mass, compared to lower amounts of protein, or 1.2 grams/kg per day.   Dietary flavonoid intake and weight maintenance: three prospective cohorts of 124086 US men and women followed for up to 24 years.  Flavonoids are a large group of antioxidants found in plant foods. This observational study suggests that a high intake of flavonoid-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, may protect against weight gain.   2. Metabolic Syndrome  Intake of fish and long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and incidence of metabolic syndrome among American young adults: a 25-year follow-up study.  This observational study suggests that eating high amounts of omega-3 fats and fish in young adulthood may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome later in life. However, eating fried fish did not seem to have similar effects.   3. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Beneficial role of vitamin K supplementation on insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and the reduced risk of type 2 diabetes: A review.  This review discusses the effects of vitamin K supplements on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and the risk of type 2 diabetes.   Post-prandial glucose and insulin responses of hummus alone or combined with a carbohydrate food: a dose–response study.  This small, randomized trial suggests that eating hummus is better for blood sugar control than eating white bread.   4. Heart Health  Association of Breakfast Intake With Incident Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease: The Japan Public Health Center-Based Study.  This observational study indicates that eating breakfast regularly may protect against stroke in Japanese people. Conversely, skipping breakfast does not seem to increase the risk of coronary heart disease.   5. Cancer  Associations of Red and Processed Meat with Survival among Patients with Cancers of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract and Lung.  This observational study suggests that eating high amounts of red or processed meat increases the risk of death among patients with cancer in the lungs or upper digestive tract. This association was weaker for unprocessed red meat.   Dietary lycopene intake and risk of prostate cancer defined by ERG protein expression.  Lycopene is an antioxidant carotenoid found in high amounts in tomatoes, guavas and watermelons. This observational study suggests that getting high amounts of lycopene from the diet may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Trans fatty acid intake is related to emotional affect in the Adventist Health Study-2.  Previous studies suggest that trans fats may increase the risk of depression. This observational study indicates that a high intake of trans fats from margarine and baked products may interfere with the ability to think clearly under emotional stress.   Hazelnut and neuroprotection: Improved memory and hindered anxiety in response to intra-hippocampal Aβ injection.  This rat study showed that eating hazelnuts, 800 mg/kg/day for 1 week, may improve memory, reduce anxiety-related behavior and reduce inflammatory markers. However, human trials need to confirm these findings.   7. Digestive Health  Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from the EPIC Study.  This observational study suggests there are no specific dietary patterns associated with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. However, a high intake of sugary drinks was a significant risk factor for those who had a low vegetable intake.  Additionally, there was a similar association for cases that occurred in the first two years after dietary assessment.   Distinct Microbiotas are Associated with Ileum-Restricted and Colon-Involving Crohn’s Disease.  Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation in the digestive tract. Some scientists believe that inflammatory bowel disease may be caused by an adverse change in the gut microbiota.  This study indicates that Crohn’s disease is associated with distinct types of bacteria, which vary depending on the location in the digestive tract. For example, high numbers of Fusobacterium were associated with Crohn’s disease in the ileum .   Microbiome–Epigenome Interactions and the Environmental Origins of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.  The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seems to be on the rise among children. This review discusses the available evidence regarding the role of nutrition and environmental factors in the development of IBD in children.   Breast Milk Protects Against Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Infants at High Risk for Autism During Early Development.  Children with autism or related disorders often have digestive problems. This observational study suggests that breastfeeding and late weaning may help prevent digestive problems for infants who are at a high risk of autism-spectrum disorders.   8. Kidney Health  Association between probiotic and yogurt consumption and kidney disease: insights from NHANES.  This observational study indicates that eating probiotic yogurt frequently, or supplementing with probiotics, may reduce the risk of kidney disease.   9. Lung Health  Effect of Prenatal Vitamin D on Asthma in Offspring.  Studies about asthma and vitamin D deficiency early in life have provided inconsistent results. This study suggests that the asthma risk of 3-year-old children is not affected by their mother’s vitamin D intake while pregnant.   Vitamin D 3 Supplementation During Pregnancy and Childhood Wheezing.  This randomized, controlled trial in pregnant women examined the effects of vitamin D supplements on childhood asthma outcomes.  The study showed that 2,800 IU of vitamin D per day did not reduce the risk of asthma symptoms in the children, compared to supplementing with 400 IU/day.   10. Immune Health  Effect of zinc supplementation on serum zinc concentration and T cell proliferation in nursing home elderly: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  An adequate zinc status is essential for the function of the immune system.  This randomized, controlled trial in elderly people showed that zinc supplementation, 30 mg per day for 3 months, improved immune function.   11. Healthy Aging and Longevity  Association between leukocyte telomere length and serum carotenoid in US adults.  Telomeres are sequences of DNA whose lengths are a marker of aging. Previous studies show that oxidative stress speeds up the shortening of the telomeres, whereas antioxidants delay the shortening.  This study in US adults also found that circulating levels of carotenoid antioxidants were significantly associated with longer telomeres in white blood cells.   Fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause mortality: evidence from a large Australian cohort study.  This observational study suggests that eating high amounts of fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of death from all causes.   12.

	Changes in Gut Bacteria Are Linked to Diet and Disease  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 27, 2016  The human digestive system is home to trillions of bacteria and other microbes ( 1 ).  Collectively known as the gut microbiota or gut flora, this is one of the most active areas of research in nutrition, obesity and human physiology.  Recently, a review article discussing the role of the microbiota in the development of obesity and metabolic diseases was published in Advances in Nutrition .  Below is a summary of the review’s main points.   Article Reviewed  Scientists at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, reviewed the available evidence linking the gut microbiota with obesity, metabolic diseases and diet.  Can We Prevent Obesity-Related Metabolic Diseases by Dietary Modulation of the Gut Microbiota?  Beneficial Functions of the Gut Microbiota  Most of the gut microbiota lives in the colon, which may host more than 1,000 different species of bacteria ( 2 , 3 ).  Some of these bacteria have beneficial or even essential functions, whereas others are neutral or potentially harmful.  In healthy people, beneficial bacteria dominate the gut environment. Their most important functions are to:   Produce short-chain fatty acids to feed the cells that line the colon ( 4 ).  Protect the gut wall and keep harmful substances out of the blood ( 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Reduce the growth of harmful microbes by competing with them for resources.  Form essential vitamins, such as vitamin K ( 8 ).  Regulate the immune system ( 9 ).   Bottom Line: Our digestive system is home to trillions of bacteria, many of which have beneficial or even essential functions.  Imbalanced Gut Microbiota is Linked to Disease  A well-balanced gut microbiota is a sign of good health.  Unhealthy lifestyle habits and certain diseases are associated with a microbiota that is imbalanced or at least different from that of healthy people. This condition is sometimes called dysbiosis .  Adverse conditions that have been associated with changes in the gut microbiota include inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( 3 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ).  The gut microbiota of obese people is also different from that of normal-weight people ( 14 , 15 ).  However, these are all observational studies that can’t demonstrate a causal relationship, and the true explanation for these associations is currently unknown.  Yet experiments in mice and humans suggest that the microbiota may play at least some role in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome ( 16 , 17 , 18 ).  This is an active area of research, and new pieces to the puzzle are gradually being discovered.  Bottom Line: Several adverse conditions, such as metabolic disorders and obesity, are associated with an imbalanced microbiota.  How Do Nutrients Affect the Gut Microbiota?  Multiple factors affect the gut microbiota, including genetics, age and how you’re born. Yet the most important factor is probably your diet â what you eat and how much ( 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ).  Below is a detailed overview of how different nutrients affect the gut microbiota.  Carbs and Fiber  Carbs are usually the main component of the human diet, and for this reason, the most common types of gut bacteria feed on carbs ( 26 ).  Some carbs, such as resistant starch, pass to the colon undigested. There, they are fermented by beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).  SCFAs are the main sources of nutrition for the cells lining the colon, and essential for colon health.  Additionally, a high rate of carb fermentation helps maintain a slightly acidic environment within the colon, favoring the growth of beneficial bacteria ( 24 , 27 , 28 ).  However, certain types of fiber are better than others. These are known as prebiotics , and include fiber such as inulin , galacto-oligosaccharides , fructo-oligosaccharides , resistant starch and arabinoxylan ( 29 ).  By increasing the activity and growth of beneficial bacteria, prebiotics have a variety of health benefits ( 30 ).  Yet keep in mind that easily digested carbs, such as sugar and refined carbs, do not offer the same benefits as whole, fiber-rich carbs.  Bottom Line: Fiber is essential for many beneficial gut bacteria. The healthiest types of fiber are collectively known as prebiotics.  Fat  Animal studies indicate that very high fat consumption may lead to metabolic endotoxemia ( 31 , 32 ).  Metabolic endotoxemia is characterized by high circulating levels of lipopolysaccharides , triggering an inflammatory response in the body.  Lipopolysaccharides, also known as endotoxins, are found in the membranes of gram-negative bacteria , which are potentially harmful.  Scientists have suggested that metabolic endotoxemia may be associated with an imbalanced gut microbiota.  They speculate that endotoxins from harmful bacteria may somehow escape across the gut wall and into the blood stream, promoting metabolic disorders ( 33 , 34 , 35 ).  This idea is supported by observational studies that have associated high levels of lipopolysaccharides with obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome ( 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ).  Interestingly, eating prebiotic fiber may counteract many of these effects ( 41 , 42 ).  However, more human studies are needed before any strong conclusions can be reached.  Bottom Line: Animal studies have associated high fat intake with metabolic endotoxemia. However, prebiotics may counteract these effects  Protein  Little is known about the effects of protein on the gut microbiota, but several studies indicate that a high intake of protein may be harmful for colon health.  Undigested protein may reach the colon, where it is fermented by bacteria that produce potentially harmful substances ( 27 , 43 , 44 ).  This may not be a concern on a well-balanced diet, since eating prebiotic fiber may counteract some of these effects ( 45 ).  Bottom Line: High protein intake may have adverse effects on colon health, but prebiotics may counteract some of them.  Probiotics  Probiotics are live bacteria that provide health benefits when consumed ( 46 ).  These include friendly bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus , which have numerous health benefits ( 47 ).  Supplements that contain both probiotics and prebiotics are known as synbiotics .  Synbiotics help the friendly bacteria survive and grow in the digestive tract, and are probably more effective than taking probiotics or prebiotics separately ( 48 ).  Bottom Line: Numerous studies show that probiotics may have various health benefits. These benefits may be greater when probiotics are taken with prebiotics.  Treating Metabolic Conditions Through Diet  A few human trials have found that supplementing with dietary fiber, including prebiotics, may change the gut microbiota. It may also improve insulin sensitivity, systemic inflammation and lipid metabolism ( 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 ).  Although these findings clearly show that taking prebiotics may improve metabolic disorders, they do not prove that these disorders were caused by an imbalance in the gut microbiota.  In fact, supplementing with prebiotics might improve metabolic conditions independently from their effects on the microbiota ( 53 ).  Bottom Line: Human trials have shown that prebiotics may improve metabolic disorders and change the gut microbiota. However, the role of the microbiota is still unclear.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this review shows that metabolic disorders, such as obesity, are associated with changes in the gut microbiota.  Additionally, studies indicate that improving the gut microbiota may help treat metabolic disorders. However, the causal role of the microbiota has yet to be proved.  Certain types of fiber, known as prebiotics, are probably the most effective dietary strategies for maintaining a healthy gut microbiota.

	Very High Amounts of Fat May Reduce Insulin Sensitivity  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 25, 2016  Studies show that calorie-reduced diets improve insulin sensitivity, regardless of their fat content ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  However, it’s unclear if this is due to the composition of the diet or weight loss.  For this reason, a group of scientists compared the effects of high- and low-fat diets, while maintaining stable weight.  Below is a review of their findings, published in the European Journal of Nutrition .   Background  Insulin sensitivity refers to how sensitive the body is to the effects of insulin.  Low insulin sensitivity, also known as insulin resistance , means the body doesn’t respond to insulin efficiently. This adverse condition characterizes type 2 diabetes and can lead to abnormally high blood sugar after meals.  It’s unclear exactly what causes insulin resistance, but several studies have examined how diet composition affects insulin sensitivity.  Two short-term studies compared the effects of diets high in fat (50–55% of calories) and low in fat (20–25% of calories) on insulin sensitivity. They found no significant differences in insulin sensitivity between diets ( 4 , 5 ).  Another study in older individuals showed that a 4-week, high-fat diet (42% of calories), high in saturated fat (24% of calories), did not cause significant changes in insulin sensitivity ( 6 ).  What’s more, an 11-day study found that a very-high-fat diet (83% of calories) had no effects on insulin sensitivity, compared to a diet that contained no fat ( 7 ).  However, the evidence is not entirely conclusive. Some studies indicate that low-fat diets may improve insulin sensitivity ( 6 , 8 ).  In short, it seems that eating high amounts of fat does not increase your risk of becoming insulin resistant, but more research is needed.  Article Reviewed  Researchers from the University of Washington in the US compared the effects of a very high-fat diet and a low-fat diet on insulin sensitivity.  A high‑fat, high‑saturated fat diet decreases insulin sensitivity without changing intra‑abdominal fat in weight‑stable overweight and obese adults.   Study Design  The main purpose of this small, randomized, controlled trial was to examine the effects of a high-fat diet, rich in saturated fat, on insulin sensitivity.  The study included 13 overweight or obese men and women, aged 18–55 years.  For the first 10 days of the study, all of the participants followed a standardized diet. It provided 47% of calories from carbs, 18% from protein, and 35% from fat, including 12% from saturated fat.  Then, the participants were assigned to two 4-week diets in a random order:   Low-fat diet: 20% of calories from fat, including 8% from saturated fat, 62% from carbs and 18% from protein.  High-fat diet: 55% of calories from fat, including 25% from saturated fat, 27% from carbs and 18% from protein.   These two diets were identical, apart from their varying fat and carb content. The major sources of fat in both diets were butter and safflower oil, high in oleic acid.  The study kitchen provided participants with all food, and they were weighed twice weekly to ensure weight stability.  The study had a crossover design, meaning that the participants followed both diets on different study periods, separated by 6 weeks.  At the beginning and end of the diets, the researchers measured insulin sensitivity, abdominal fat and fasting levels of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs).  Only 7 participants completed both diets, or 54% of those who originally started.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, crossover trial comparing the effects of a very high-fat diet and a low-fat diet on insulin sensitivity.  Finding 1: A High-Fat Diet Reduced Insulin Sensitivity  Insulin sensitivity is often assessed by injecting people with insulin and then measuring blood sugar clearance, or how quickly blood sugar levels drop.  During the high-fat diet, insulin sensitivity decreased, whereas it remained constant during the low-fat diet.  The chart below compares the differences in the change in blood sugar clearance during each of the two diets. The blood sugar response is shown for both low and high doses of insulin.   These results cannot be explained by changes in body weight or abdominal fat, since the participants’ weight remained the same during the study.  The researchers speculated that the saturated fat in the high-fat diet may have contributed to the decrease in insulin sensitivity, which is supported by other studies.  In one study, when healthy participants followed a diet high in saturated fat (17% of calories) for three months, insulin sensitivity decreased by 12.5% ( 9 ).  Other studies have shown that single meals or diets high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat improve insulin sensitivity, compared to saturated fat ( 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ).  These studies indicate that insulin sensitivity is influenced by the type of fat eaten, rather than the total dietary fat content. However, further studies are needed.  Bottom Line: The high-fat diet reduced insulin sensitivity, whereas it remained constant on the low-fat diet.  Finding 2: Increases in Skin Fat Were Associated With Higher Insulin Sensitivity  Why the high-fat diet reduced insulin sensitivity is unclear. However, the researchers observed a few significant associations.  During the low-fat diet, the researchers found that increases in the amounts of skin fat were associated with better insulin sensitivity.  Although there was a similar trend during the high-fat diet, the association was not statistically significant.  Conversely, on both diets, an increase in the content of omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) was associated with reduced insulin sensitivity.  Yet it should be noted that these were observational findings, and do not prove a causal relationship.  Bottom Line: Increased skin fat was associated with increased insulin sensitivity. Conversely, high blood levels of omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid were associated with reduced insulin sensitivity.  Limitations  This study was nicely designed, but had a few minor limitations.  First, the study was very small, including only 13 participants. For this reason, it may not have had the statistical power to detect smaller differences as significant.  Second, the dropout rate was very high, or 46%, indicating that dietary adherence may have been difficult.  Third, the study was designed to compare the effects of high-fat and low-fat diets on insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence for the effects of saturated fat on insulin sensitivity.  Finally, the study included individuals with normal blood sugar control, and the high-fat diet contained higher amounts of fat than are typically consumed. As a result, the findings may not apply to diabetics or those who consume lower amounts of fat.  Bottom Line: This study was very small and the dropout rate was high. Additionally, the findings may not apply to normal real-life settings or people with type 2 diabetes.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study suggests that a diet very high in fat, or saturated fat, make the body less sensitive to the effects of insulin.  However, the results may only apply to very high amounts of fat or specific types of fatty acids.  Tags: Insulin sensitivity , Saturated fat

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Jan 15th–Jan 22nd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 22, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, January 15th, to Friday, January 22nd, 2016.   Research Reviews  In the past week, we reviewed two research articles: one from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and the other from the Nutrition Journal .   Review:  Isolated Trans Fats are Unhealthy, Regardless of the Source.  Study:  Vaccenic acid and trans fatty acid isomers from partially hydrogenated oil both adversely affect LDL cholesterol: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.  Summary: This clinical trial compared the effects of synthetic and natural trans fatty acids on the blood lipid profile.  The main finding was that vaccenic acid (the most common natural trans fat) and industrially produced trans fats both adversely affected the blood lipid profile.   Review:  Chitosan Supplements May Cause Weight Loss.  Study:  Single-blind, placebo controlled randomised clinical study of chitosan for body weight reduction.  Summary: This randomized, controlled trial examined the effectiveness of 2,500 mg of chitosan on weight loss.  The study showed that supplementing with chitosan may lead to significant weight loss, apparently without any changes in diet or physical activity.   New Research From Around the World  Plenty of research articles and reviews came out this week. Below is a selection of the most interesting or relevant papers, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Lung Health  Skin Health  Muscles and Physical Performance  Pregnancy and Infant Health  Diets  Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Clinical effectiveness of very-low-energy diets in the management of weight loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Official guidelines generally suggest that very-low calorie diets (VLEDs) can lead to adverse health effects, such as as rapid post-diet weight regain.  This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials concludes that VLEDs appear to be tolerable, and have less adverse effects than the guidelines suggest.   Mediterranean Dietary Pattern in Pregnant Women and Offspring Risk of Overweight and Abdominal Obesity in Early Childhood: The INMA Cohort Study.  Previous studies in animals suggest that the diet of pregnant mothers may affect their offspring’s risk of becoming obese, regardless of the mother’s weight.  This observational study in Spanish mothers and children indicates that there is no link between the mother’s adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the child’s risk of obesity. However, the diet was associated with smaller waist circumference.   Can We Prevent Obesity-Related Metabolic Diseases by Dietary Modulation of the Gut Microbiota?  This review discusses the possible role of gut bacteria, also called the gut microbiota, on the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases.  It speculates that abnormal gut microbiota may be a cause or consequence of obesity, or maybe a bit of both. It also discusses potential dietary ways to change the gut environment and treat obesity.   Effects of low-carbohydrate diets v. low-fat diets on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.  Previous studies comparing the effectiveness of low-carb and low-fat diets in reducing heart disease risk or body weight have provided inconsistent results.  This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that low-carb diets may lead to greater weight loss than low-fat diets. Low-carb diets may also lead to a greater increase in LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol.   Oral intake of a combination of glucosyl hesperidin and caffeine elicits an anti-obesity effect in healthy, moderately obese subjects: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.  Previous studies in mice indicate that a combination of caffeine and glucosyl hesperidin (GH) may decrease the accumulation of body fat.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that taking GH (500 mg) and caffeine (50–75 mg), every day for 12 weeks, significantly reduced belly fat, compared to a placebo.   A comparison of a behavioral weight loss program to a stress management program: A pilot randomized controlled trial.  Mental stress is a significant risk factor for obesity. This is because many people seek stress relief by eating. This small, randomized, controlled trial compared the effectiveness of a stress management program (SMP) and a weight loss program.  The weight loss program caused significantly more weight loss than the SMP. However, the SMP improved blood pressure, stress and depression.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Effects of the internal circadian system and circadian misalignment on glucose tolerance in chronic shift workers.  Previous studies have shown that shift work is a risk factor for diabetes. This randomized, crossover trial in healthy shift workers supported previous studies.  Shift work impairs blood sugar control by disrupting the body clock and causing circadian misalignment. The study also shows that blood sugar control is impaired later in the day, or in the so-called “biological evening.”   Can Walnuts Reduce Diabetes Risk? If So, in Whom?  Previous observational studies suggest that walnuts may protect against type 2 diabetes. This observational study suggests that these benefits are greater in Hispanics and African Americans, compared to non-hispanic European Americans.   Associations of Dietary Carbohydrates and Carbohydrate Subtypes with Diabetes Risk Factors in the Diabetes Prevention Program.  This observational study suggests that eating high amounts of vegetables and fiber, and limiting the intake of sugary soda and candy, may protect against type 2 diabetes.   3. Heart Health  Very-High-Fat and Low-Fat Isocaloric Diets Exert Similar Metabolic Benefits but Different Temporal Effects on Cardiometabolic Risk Markers.  Low-carb, very-high-fat diets are effective for weight loss, yet previous studies indicate that they may worsen heart disease risk factors.  This 12-week, randomized trial compared the effects of a low-carb, very-high-fat diet and a high-carb, low-fat diet on risk factors for heart disease. Both diets improved body composition and didn’t worsen any risk factors for heart disease.   Dietary Patterns and Blood Pressure in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials estimated the effects of different diets on blood pressure.  The study indicates that diets rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, fish and dairy may reduce blood pressure. Diets high in meat, candy and alcohol may increase blood pressure.   Maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy and offspring cardiometabolic health at age 6 years: The Generation R study.  This observational study suggests that the dietary patterns of pregnant mothers are not associated with the heart and metabolic health of their children when they are 6 years old.   A Randomized Study of the Effects of Additional Fruit and Nuts Consumption on Hepatic Fat Content, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Basal Metabolic Rate.  This randomized trial compared the effects of two high-calorie diets on metabolic rate and risk factors for heart disease. One of the diets provided extra calories from fruit, whereas the other diet provided extra calories from nuts.  Weight gain was similar in both groups. Increased fruit intake seems to be safe, and did not increase liver fat or worsen any risk factors for heart disease. However, high fruit intake increased insulin levels.   The association between dietary saturated fatty acids and ischemic heart disease depends on the type and source of fatty acid in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands cohort.  This observational study indicates that a high intake of saturated fat does not raise heart disease risk. However, this association may depend on the amounts and proportions of different fats in the diet.   4. Cancer  Plasma carotenoids, vitamin C, tocopherols, and retinol and the risk of breast cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort.  This observational study indicates that high intake of beta-carotene and alpha-carotene may reduce the risk of breast cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Energy Contents of Frequently Ordered Restaurant Meals and Comparison with Human Energy Requirements and US Department of Agriculture Database Information: A Multisite Randomized Study.  This study suggests that food eaten in restaurants may contribute to obesity. Portion sizes are generally large and the food is often rich in calories.   Advertising as a cue to consume: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of acute exposure to unhealthy food and nonalcoholic beverage advertising on intake in children and adults.  This meta-analysis indicates that food advertising may increase food intake in children, but not in adults.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Examining the potential clinical value of curcumin in the prevention and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.  Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Previous studies suggest that it may have beneficial effects on neural function, possibly delaying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.  This review discusses the available evidence. In short, clinical studies indicate limited benefits of curcumin supplementation for Alzheimer’s. This is possibly because its bioavailability is relatively poor.   Clinical improvement following vitamin D3 supplementation in Autism Spectrum Disorder.  This clinical trial suggests that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to autism severity. Vitamin D levels are lower in children with autism than healthy children. Additionally, vitamin D3 supplements appeared to improve symptoms in autistic children.   Coffee induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human neuroblastama SH-SY5Y cells.  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein formed in the body that may protect neurons and stimulate their growth.  This test-tube experiment suggests that coffee may increase VEGF formation, which may contribute to coffee’s beneficial effects on neural disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.   Evaluation of Dietary Nutrients in Relation to Clinical Outcomes in Chronic-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease. It’s characterized by a variety of neurological symptoms, ranging from mental problems to impaired eyesight, muscle weakness and lack of coordination.  This study suggests that increased fiber intake may help improve MS. This may be explained by the beneficial effects of fiber on the gut bacteria, which may reduce systemic inflammation.   7. Lung Health  Dietary anthocyanin intake and age-related decline in lung function: longitudinal findings from the VA Normative Aging Study.  Anthocyanins are a group of antioxidant flavonoids that are responsible for the vibrant colors of many flowers and fruits. This observational study suggests that a high dietary intake of anthocyanins may improve lung function in older people.   8. Skin Health  Skin-Whitening and Overall Skin Tone-Improving Effects of Oral Supplementation with Lutein and Zeaxanthin Isomers: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.  Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoid antioxidants. This randomized, controlled trial showed that supplementing with lutein and zeaxanthin for 12 weeks improved skin tone, compared to a placebo.  Additionally, it improved the participants’ tolerance to sunlight, reducing the risk of sunburns. At the same time, lutein and zeaxanthin appeared to reduce skin pigmentation, causing skin whitening.   9. Muscles and Physical Performance  Vitamin D is associated with cardiopulmonary exercise capacity: results of two independent cohorts of healthy adults.  This observational study suggests that high circulating levels of vitamin D may increase people’s endurance.   The effects of a high protein diet on indices of health and body composition – a crossover trial in resistance-trained men.  This randomized trial showed that taking 3.3 grams of protein per kg of body weight, for 8 weeks, did not affect body composition, blood lipids, blood sugar or kidney function, compared to supplementing with 2.6 grams.   10. Pregnancy and Infant Health  Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy.  This Cochrane review concluded that supplementing with vitamin D may reduce the risk of premature deliveries, high blood pressure and low birth weight.  However, the number of high-quality studies is limited, and no strong conclusions can be made about the safety and usefulness of these supplements for pregnant women.   11. Diets  Health Effects of 3-Day Fruit and Vegetable Juice Fasting.  This study examined the health effects of 3-day juice fasting. The fasting led to weight loss, decreased oxidation and increased circulating levels of nitric oxide. Previous studies have associated similar changes with improved heart health.   12. Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals  Public Policy and Folic Acid Fortification: Great Harm or Help?  Folic acid is a synthetic form of vitamin B9, and the body may have trouble converting it into a biologically active form.  Many studies indicate that high levels of un-metabolized folic acid may cause harm, and this review discusses those potentially harmful effects.   Removing Potatoes from Children’s Diets May Compromise Potassium Intake.  This study suggests that potatoes are an important dietary source of potassium for many people, especially children.   Essential Nutrient Interactions: Does Low or Suboptimal Magnesium Status Interact with Vitamin D and/or Calcium Status?  The ratio of magnesium and calcium may have relevance for health, and adequate magnesium is necessary for the biosynthesis of vitamin D in the body.  This review discusses the potential interactions between magnesium status and vitamin D or calcium.   Consequences of a high phosphorus intake on mineral metabolism and bone remodeling in dependence of calcium intake in healthy subjects – a randomized placebo-controlled human intervention study.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that a high phosphorus intake has no effect on circulating levels of phosphate in blood. Additionally, high phosphorus intakes seem to adversely affect calcium metabolism.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Chitosan Supplements May Cause Weight Loss  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 20, 2016  Chitosan is a dietary fiber sold as a weight loss supplement. However, studies have provided inconsistent results about its effectiveness.  Recently, a team of researchers from India evaluated the effects of one weight loss supplement containing chitosan.  Below is a detailed summary of their findings, published in Nutrition Journal .   Background  Chitosan is a synthetic dietary fiber made from chitin , which comes from the shells of crustaceans. It is also found in the cell walls of fungi ( 1 ).  Chitosan has special properties that bind with fat, decreasing fat absorption. For this reason, taking chitosan with meals may reduce the overall calorie content. Chitosan may also reduce blood cholesterol levels ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ).  Several studies have evaluated the effects of chitosan on body weight. Here are their findings from over the years:   1999: 2,000 mg of chitosan a day, for 28 days, had no significant effects ( 6 ).  2001: 3,000 mg of chitosan a day, for 12 weeks, had no significant effects ( 7 ).   2004: This review found chitosan’s effects on body weight to be minimal, and unlikely to be clinically relevant ( 8 ).  2006: Along with a behavior modification program, 3,000 mg of chitosan each day, for 60 days, caused significant weight loss of 2.8 lbs (1.3 kg) ( 9 ).  2008: Chitosan may have some minimal, short-term benefits, but is unlikely to have any clinically relevant effects ( 10 ).  2008: Along with exercise, 2,000 mg of chitosan (polyglucosamine) a day, for 4 months, led to an additional 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg) of weight loss ( 11 ).  2015: Along with diet and exercise, 1,700 mg of chitosan (polyglucosamine) a day, for 24 weeks, caused an additional 3.9 lbs (1.8 kg) of weight loss ( 12 ).   In short, most of the evidence suggests that 1,700–3,000 mg of chitosan per day may help reduce body weight over the course of several months.  However, chitosan does not seem to work any miracles on its own. It needs to be used with other weight loss strategies, such as diet or exercise.  Article Reviewed  A group of Indian researchers examined the effectiveness of 2,500 mg of chitosan on body weight in overweight and obese men and women.  Single-blind, placebo controlled randomised clinical study of chitosan for body weight reduction.  Basic Study Design  This was a 90-day, single-blind, randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of chitosan for weight loss.  It was a phase IV trial , testing the safety and effectiveness of a patented weight loss supplement, KiOnutrime-CsG® , produced by KitoZyme .  A total of 96 overweight or obese men and women, aged 18 to 65 years, started the study. They were unevenly randomized, in the ratio of 2:1, into one of two groups:   Chitosan: 64 participants took chitosan capsules before breakfast, lunch and dinner, totaling 2,500 mg per day.  Placebo: 32 participants took the same amount of placebo capsules, containing a cellulose powder.   The chitosan was of fungal origin and was taken 15 minutes before meals. Previous research suggests that it may take some time for chitosan to dissolve in the digestive system before becoming usable ( 4 ).  At the start, middle and end of the study, the researchers measured body weight, body composition, the blood lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).  A total of 86 participants completed the study, or 90% of those who initially started.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of the weight loss supplement chitosan.  Finding 1: Chitosan Led to Weight Loss  Supplementing with chitosan led to significantly more weight loss than the placebo.  In fact, those who took chitosan lost 2.2 lbs (1.0 kg) each month, on average. This amounted to 6.8 lbs (3.1 kg) over the 3-month study period.  In comparison, the placebo group did not experience significant weight loss.   This weight loss in the supplement group was caused by loss of fat mass and lean mass, as shown in the chart below.   Similarly, waist and hip circumference decreased among the participants in the supplement group.  These findings are interesting, because the participants did not go on a diet or increase their physical activity. The chitosan, on its own, had significant benefits.  Previous trials do not support these results. Without other weight loss strategies, chitosan supplements have not lead to significant weight loss ( 6 , 7 ).  However, chitosan may be effective when participants are also making dietary, exercise or behavior modifications ( 9 , 11 , 12 ).  Bottom Line: Supplementing with chitosan led to significant weight loss without any dietary restrictions or increased exercise.  Finding 2: Chitosan Improved Blood Sugar Control  HbA1c is also known as glycated hemoglobin. It is measured to evaluate the average blood sugar levels of the past few weeks.  In the present study, supplementing with chitosan led to a reduction of HbA1c levels in participants who had high levels (over 6%) initially.  These results are supported by a previous study showing that chitosan may reduce blood sugar after meals in humans ( 13 ).  Bottom Line: Chitosan reduced the levels of HbA1c. These findings suggest that chitosan may improve blood sugar control.  Finding 3: Chitosan Did Not Affect Blood Lipids  The researchers measured several different blood lipids at the start, middle and end of the study. These included triglycerides, HDL, LDL and VLDL.  None of these blood lipids changed significantly during the study period.  These findings are inconsistent with previous studies showing that chitosan may have significant positive effects on the blood lipid profile ( 14 , 15 ).  Bottom Line: Supplementing with chitosan had no significant effects on the blood lipid profile.  Limitations  This study had several potential limitations.  First, it was conducted by Ethicare Clinical Trial Services , which specializes in conducting clinical research for pharmaceutical companies. As a result, competing interests may have been involved.  Additionally, two of the paper’s authors were employees of KitoZyme, the company that produces the weight loss supplement. This is a clear conflict of interest.  Second, the researchers were not blinded. This probably didn’t affect the results, but does create the potential for bias ( 16 , 17 ).  Third, the researchers also assessed body composition using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which can be inaccurate ( 18 ).  Finally, the supplement assignment was unequal, as there were twice as many participants receiving chitosan than the control. The researchers do not clearly explain why they did this ( 19 ).  Bottom Line: The researchers had potential competing interests. There were also some minor limitations to the research methods and study design.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study showed that chitosan supplements may lead to significant weight loss over time, without dietary changes or increased exercise.  However, these results may depend on the form of chitosan or the way it’s produced. The study only examined KiOnutrime-CsG®, a formula developed by KitoZyme.  Additionally, two of the paper’s authors were employees of KitoZyme, and the study was done by a company that’s funded by the pharmaceutical industry.  Therefore, these findings need to be confirmed by an independent research team.  Tags: Chitosan , Supplements , Weight loss

	Isolated Trans Fats are Unhealthy, Regardless of the Source  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 18, 2016  Industrially produced trans fats are known to be bad for heart health. Yet the effects of natural trans fats, found in dairy products and meat, are less clear.  For this reason, a team of scientists compared the effects of these two groups of trans fats on the blood lipid profile.  Below is a detailed overview of their results, recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Background  Trans fats are a type of dietary fat mainly found in processed food products containing partially hydrogenated oil.  These include foods such as margarine, shortening, deep-fried food, microwave popcorn, and store-bought cookies and cakes.  However, trans fats are also naturally present in smaller amounts in body or milk fat from ruminant animals like cows, sheep and goats.  Many studies suggest that a high intake of industrially produced trans fats may increase the risk of heart disease, and limiting intake is recommended ( 1 ).  However, the health benefits of natural trans fats are less clear. One type, conjugated linoleic acid, may even have health benefits.  Nonetheless, observational studies in humans have provided inconsistent results about the health effects of natural trans fats in general ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ).  Human trials are few and have not been able to provide strong evidence, due to shortfalls in their design ( 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers examined the difference between industrially produced and natural trans fats on the blood lipid profile.  Vaccenic acid and trans fatty acid isomers from partially hydrogenated oil both adversely affect LDL cholesterol: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.  Basic Study Design  This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing the effects of synthetic and natural trans fatty acids on blood lipids.  Healthy men and women, aged 25 to 65 years, participated in the study. Most of them were middle-aged, overweight or obese, and at a potential risk for heart disease.  The participants were assigned to four diets in a random order:   Vaccenic acid (VA): 3.3% of calories were from vaccenic acid , the most common natural trans fat.  Industrially produced trans fats (iTF): 3.3% of calories were from a mixture of industrially produced trans fats from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.  Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA): 0.9% of calories were from conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11-CLA), a natural trans fat associated with health benefits.  Control diet: 0.1% of calories were from mixed trans fats, both naturally and industrially produced.   Each diet lasted for 24 days and was completely controlled. All the diets had the same macronutrient composition: 34% of calories from fat, 50% from carbs and 17% from protein.  The additional calories from trans fats replaced calories from stearic acid, a common fatty acid that has neutral effects on both LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol.  The study had a crossover design, meaning that each participant was in each of the groups on different occasions. At the start and end of each of the diets, the researchers measured blood lipids, inflammatory markers and body weight.  A total of 116 participants started the study, and 91% completed at least one of the four study periods.  Bottom Line: This randomized, controlled trial compared the effects of industrially produced trans fats and natural trans fats on blood lipids.  Finding 1: All Trans Fats Increased Total Cholesterol  High levels of cholesterol in the blood may increase the risk of heart disease.  In the current study, both the iTF and the VA diets increased total cholesterol, compared to the control diet. However, the VA diet increased cholesterol even more.   Therefore, it can be concluded that trans fats increase cholesterol, regardless of their source. One exception is conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which did not affect total cholesterol.  Bottom Line: Regardless of their dietary source, trans fats increased total cholesterol. Natural trans fats in the VA diet, however, increased cholesterol more. CLA, additionally, had neutral effects.  Finding 2: Natural Trans Fat Increased LDL-Cholesterol and Apolipoprotein B  When levels of cholesterol become too high, it is often because of increased concentration of low-density lipoproteins (LDL).  Cholesterol carried around in LDL (LDL-cholesterol) is considered especially unhealthy when its levels are abnormally high.  In the present study, LDL-cholesterol increased during both the iTF and the VA diets, compared to the control. The rise in LDL-cholesterol, however, was significantly higher during the VA diet, as shown in the chart below.   These results are supported by a previous study showing that a diet high in vaccenic acid increased LDL-cholesterol ( 8 ).  Apolipoprotein B  Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is a class of proteins found on the surface of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). High levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.  In the current study, both the VA and the iTF diets increased levels of apoB, compared to the control. However, apoB increased more during the VA diet, as shown in the chart below.   Bottom Line: Both types of trans fats raised levels of LDL-cholesterol and apoB, but VA caused larger increases to both.  Finding 3: Natural Trans Fat Increased HDL-Cholesterol and Apolipoprotein A1  High levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL-cholesterol) are considered beneficial for heart health.  Although this is supported by many observational studies, the benefits of raising HDL-cholesterol have not been confirmed in clinical trials ( 11 ).  In the present study, HDL-cholesterol increased during the VA diet. In comparison, the iTF diet had no effects.   Both the VA diet and the iTF diet increased the ratio of total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol similarly. The same applied to the ratio of LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol.  Apolipoprotein A1  Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) is a class of proteins mainly found on the surface of high-density lipoproteins (HDL).  As with HDLs, high levels of apoA1 have been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. In the present study, apoA1 increased during the VA diet, but not the iTF diet.   Bottom Line: Naturally occurring vaccenic acid increased levels of HDL-cholesterol and decreased levels of apoA1, while the industrially produced trans fats did not affect either.  Finding 4: Natural Trans Fat Increased Triglycerides  Triglycerides are a type of fat that circulate in the blood.  As with cholesterol, abnormally high levels of triglycerides have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.  In the current study, the levels of triglycerides rose higher during the VA diet, compared to the iTF diet.   In contrast, CLA lowered triglyceride levels, compared to the control.  Bottom Line: Vaccenic acid increased triglycerides more than industrially produced trans fats.  Finding 5: Natural Trans Fat Decreased Fibrinogen  Fibrinogen is a type of protein that helps the blood clot. As a result, high levels of fibrinogen are associated with an increased risk of heart disease ( 12 , 13 ).  In the present study, the VA diet lowered fibrinogen, compared to iTF and the control diet.  High levels of fibrinogen have been associated with systemic inflammation. In this study, however, levels of inflammatory markers remained unchanged across diets.  Bottom Line: Levels of fibrinogen decreased when the participants were on a diet high in vaccenic acid. Industrially produced trans fats had no effects.  Limitations  This study did not appear to have any serious limitations, but a few issues should be mentioned.  First, the VA and iTF diets were supposed to provide the same amount of calories from trans fat. However, these two diets actually differed by 0.67%.  The VA diet provided 3.86% of calories from vaccenic acid, whereas the iTF diet provided 3.26% of calories from industrially produced trans fats. These differences might have affected the results.  Second, the study tested much higher amounts of trans fat than are normally consumed in the USA.  Certain subgroups of people may reach similar intake levels for industrially produced trans fats. The amount of vaccenic acid used, however, exceeded normal dietary intakes by far.  Finally, the dietary context may play a role. In this study, the researchers used synthetic vaccenic acid that was not consumed with dairy fat or meat.  Previous studies suggest that vaccenic acid does not affect the risk of heart disease when eaten in normal amounts with milk or meat ( 14 , 15 , 16 ).  Bottom Line: The study did not have any important limitations. However, the VA diet provided a greater proportion of calories from trans fat, compared to the iTF diet.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study shows that both industrially produced trans fats and vaccenic acid, the most common natural trans fat, adversely affect the blood lipid profile, when consumed in equal amounts.  However, this does not mean that natural foods containing natural trans fats need to be avoided. Studies indicate that when eaten in normal amounts with milk or meat, vaccenic acid does not impair heart health ( 14 , 15 , 16 ).  Also, natural trans fats include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which may have health benefits.  For optimal health, it is more important to limit the intake of industrially produced trans fats from processed food.  Tags: Cholesterol , Heart health , Trans fat

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Jan 8th–Jan 15th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 15, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, Jan 8th, to Friday, Jan 15th, 2016.   Research Reviews  Two articles were reviewed in the past week: one from Journals of Gerontology: Medical Sciences , and the other from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Review:  Eating Less May Prevent Disease and Help You Live Longer.  Study:  A 2-Year Randomized Controlled Trial of Human Caloric Restriction: Feasibility and Effects on Predictors of Health Span and Longevity.  Summary: This 2-year, randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of long-term calorie restriction on predictors for longevity in healthy, non-obese men and women.  The study found that moderate calorie restriction improved several predictors for longevity, such as body weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, inflammation and thyroid hormones. Additionally, it slowed metabolism.   Review:  The DASH Diet Lowers Blood Pressure, Even With More Fat.  Study:  Comparison of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and a higher-fat DASH diet on blood pressure and lipids and lipoproteins: a randomized controlled trial.  Summary: This randomized, controlled trial compared the effects of a standard DASH diet and a higher-fat, lower-carb DASH diet.  The study showed that the higher-fat DASH diet did not impair risk factors for heart disease, compared to the control. Also, its effects on blood pressure were similar to the conventional DASH diet.   New Research From Around the World  Tons of new research articles came out this week. Here is a selection of the most interesting ones, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Metabolic Syndrome  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Bone Health  Allergies and Immune Health  Men’s Health    Obesity and Weight Loss  Consuming yellow pea fiber reduces voluntary energy intake and body fat in overweight/obese adults in a 12-week randomized controlled trial.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that taking 15 grams of yellow pea fiber each day, for 12 weeks, may cause small reductions in body weight and body fat by suppressing calorie intake.   Single-blind, placebo controlled randomised clinical study of chitosan for body weight reduction.  Chitosan is a type of dietary fiber, produced from the shells of shrimp. It may support weight loss by suppressing fat absorption, but previous studies have provided conflicting results.  This randomized, controlled trial in overweight and obese people found that supplementing with chitosan, 2,500 mg per day for 90 days, reduced body weight by 6.5 lbs (3 kg), on average, compared to a placebo.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Circulating Alpha-Tocopherol and Insulin Sensitivity Among Older Men With Chronic Kidney Disease.  People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently insulin resistant. Scientists have suggested that vitamin E may help increase levels of insulin and improve insulin sensitivity in these individuals.  This observational study suggests that high levels of alpha-tocopherol, which is the most common form of vitamin E, may increase insulin sensitivity for people with CKD.   Pre-pregnancy potato consumption and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: prospective cohort study.  This prospective, observational study indicates that a high consumption of potatoes before pregnancy may increase the risk of gestational diabetes. On the other hand, eating other vegetables, whole-grain foods or legumes may reduce the risk.   Long-term risk of type 2 diabetes in relation to habitual iron intake in women with a history of gestational diabetes: a prospective cohort study.  Too much iron, a so-called iron overload, may damage the cells that produce insulin, increasing the risk of diabetes.  This observational study in women, who previously had diabetes during pregnancy, suggests that high iron intake may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.   Baseline insulin sensitivity affects response to high-maize resistant starch in women: a randomized, controlled trial.  Resistant starch (RS) is a type of dietary fiber that may improve blood sugar control. This randomized, controlled trial showed that supplementing with 30 grams a day of RS from high- amylose maize, for 4 weeks, may increase insulin sensitivity.   Heart Health  Do dry roasting, lightly salting nuts affect their cardioprotective properties and acceptability?  Previous studies suggest that eating raw nuts may reduce the risk of heart disease. However, it is unclear whether this also applies to roasted and salted nuts.  This randomized, crossover study suggests that eating dry-roasted and lightly salted hazelnuts, 30 grams per day for 28 days, does not worsen blood pressure or the blood lipid profile, compared to raw hazelnuts.   Dietary fibre to prevent cardiovascular disease.  This Cochrane review concludes that dietary fiber may improve some risk factors for heart disease, such as blood pressure and blood lipids.  However, studies are generally short-term and do not prove that high fiber intake reduces the incidence of heart disease events. Long-term, randomized, controlled trials are needed.   Defecation frequency and cardiovascular disease mortality in Japan: the Ohsaki cohort study.  Previous studies suggest that constipation is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. This large, observational study supports earlier findings, indicating that low defecation frequency may increase people’s risk of heart disease.   Weight loss is superior to exercise in improving the atherogenic lipid profile in a sedentary, overweight population with stable coronary artery disease: A randomized trial.  This randomized trial suggests that a low-calorie diet is more effective than aerobic exercise for improving the blood lipid profile.   The effects of lutein on cardiometabolic health across the life course: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Lutein is a carotenoid antioxidant found in high amounts in kale and spinach. This meta-analysis and systematic review concludes that a higher intake of lutein may promote better heart health.   Fruit and Vegetable Consumption and the Incidence of Hypertension in Three Prospective Cohort Studies.  This large, observational study suggests that eating more whole fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of high blood pressure.   Vasculoprotective Effects of Dietary Cocoa Flavanols in Patients on Hemodialysis: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.  Hemodialysis is a mechanical process that cleans the blood in patients with kidney disease. One of the side effects is a dysfunction of the lining of the blood vessels, which may lead to clogged arteries.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that drinking a cocoa beverage rich in cocoa antioxidants (flavanols), 900 mg per day for 30 days, improved blood vessel function, reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate.   Metabolic Syndrome  High dietary calcium intake and a lack of dairy consumption are associated with metabolic syndrome in obese males: the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010 to 2012.  This observational study in obese, Korean men indicates that a high intake of dairy products may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome. Conversely, a high intake of calcium, without dairy, may increase the risk.   Higher levels of serum lycopene are associated with reduced mortality in individuals with metabolic syndrome.  Lycopene is a carotenoid antioxidant found in high amounts in tomatoes and watermelon. This observational study shows that high levels of lycopene in blood are associated with a reduced risk of death in people with metabolic syndrome.   Cancer  Strong association of relatively low and extremely excessive iodine intakes with thyroid cancer in an iodine-replete area.  This observational study suggests that both low and excessive intakes of iodine may increase the risk of thyroid cancer.   Appetite and Eating  Attention with a mindful attitude attenuates subjective appetitive reactions and food intake following food-cue exposure.  This study suggests that mindful attention to the hedonic properties of food may reduce calorie intake by affecting appetite.   l-rhamnose as a source of colonic propionate inhibits insulin secretion but does not influence measures of appetite or food intake.  L- rhamnose and inulin are simple carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion. They reach the colon intact, where they are fermented by bacteria.  This small, randomized trial found that neither L-rhamnose nor inulin had any effects on appetite following meals. However, they may improve blood sugar control.   Bone Health  Effect of Hesperidin with and without a Calcium (Calcilock®) Supplement on Bone Health in Postmenopausal Women.  Hesperidin is one of the most abundant antioxidant flavonoids found in citrus fruits. Previous studies suggest that it may prevent bone loss in female rats who have had their ovaries removed.  This small, randomized, crossover trial in postmenopausal women showed that supplementing with 500 grams of hesperidin may reduce bone loss when calcium supplements are taken as well. On its own, hesperidin had no effects.   Allergies and Immune Health  Maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and cow’s milk allergy in offspring.  This observational study suggests that high milk consumption during pregnancy may reduce the child’s risk of becoming allergic to milk.   Dietary plant stanol ester consumption improves immune function in asthma patients: results of a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.  Plant sterols are a type of fat, resembling cholesterol, that are found in high amounts in vegetable oils. Stanols are a saturated type of plant sterols.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that supplementing with plant stanols, 4 grams every day for 4 weeks, improved immune function in asthma patients.   Men’s Health  Dietary flavonoid intake and incidence of erectile dysfunction.  Erectile dysfunction is a problem characterized by an inability to initiate or maintain an erection. This observational study suggests that a diet rich in flavonoid antioxidants, from plant foods, may reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction.  Tags: Weekly recap

	The DASH Diet Lowers Blood Pressure, Even With More Fat  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 13, 2016  The DASH diet is designed to reduce blood pressure and improve blood lipids.  It’s typically low in fat and relatively high in carbs, but it’s not clear what role these macronutrients play in the diet’s effectiveness.  For this reason, a group of researchers compared the effects of a higher-fat, lower-carb DASH diet to the conventional DASH diet.  Their results were recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Background  DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.  It is currently the world’s most popular diet aimed at lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart disease.  The original DASH diet has the following characteristics ( 1 , 2 ):   High in fruits and vegetables.  High in whole grains and fiber.  Includes nuts, seeds and legumes several times weekly.  High in low-fat dairy products.  Relatively low in red meat, poultry and fish.  Low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium.  Relatively high in potassium, magnesium and calcium.  Relatively low in refined sugar.   A large, observational study, called the Nurses’ Health Study, found a DASH-type diet to be associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke ( 3 ).  Some researchers believe that the DASH diet may reduce heart disease risk because of its low saturated fat content ( 4 , 5 ).  However, this idea has not been put to the test.  Article Reviewed  A team of scientists from the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, in California, compared the effects of the standard DASH diet and a higher-fat, lower-carb DASH diet on blood pressure and blood lipids.  Comparison of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and a higher-fat DASH diet on blood pressure and lipids and lipoproteins: a randomized controlled trial.  Basic Study Design  This randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of a modified DASH diet and the standard DASH diet on blood pressure and blood lipids. The modified diet included more dairy fat and fewer carbs.  The participants were healthy men and women with systolic blood pressure less than 160 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 95 mm Hg.  The participants were assigned to three groups in random order:   Standard DASH diet: Participants followed the conventional DASH diet.  Higher-fat DASH diet: This diet included more dairy fat and less carbs, but was otherwise identical to the standard DASH diet.  Control diet: The control diet was designed to represent a normal Western diet.   In the higher-fat DASH diet, the saturated fat content was increased from 8% to 14% of daily calories. To keep the calorie content the same, the carb content was also reduced by 12% of daily calories.  Each of these diets lasted for 3 weeks. The study had a crossover design, meaning that all of the participants followed all three diets during different study periods, separated by a 2-week washout period.  At the beginning and end of each of the three diets, the researchers measured blood pressure, blood lipids, body weight and body fat.  A total of 36 participants completed the study.  Bottom Line: This randomized, crossover trial examined the effects of a higher-fat, lower-carb DASH diet on blood pressure and blood lipids.  Finding 1: Dairy Fat Did Not Adversely Affect Blood Pressure  Both the standard DASH diet and the higher-fat DASH diet reduced blood pressure to a similar extent, compared to the control diet, as shown in the chart below.   However, blood pressure was significantly lower two weeks after the participants had finished the higher-fat DASH diet, suggesting delayed effects.  This means that eating more saturated dairy fat on the DASH diet does not adversely affect blood pressure.  Other studies have found that modifying the standard DASH diet by replacing carbs with unsaturated fat or protein yields similar or greater improvements in blood pressure ( 6 , 7 , 8 ).  Bottom Line: The standard DASH diet and the higher-fat DASH diet reduced blood pressure to a similar extent, compared to the control diet.  Finding 2: Higher-Fat DASH Diet Reduced Triglycerides  The DASH diet and the higher-fat DASH diet had different effects on the blood lipid profile. The higher-fat DASH diet reduced the levels of triglycerides, as shown in the chart below.   This modest reduction in triglycerides may be explained by the lower amounts of carbs in the higher-fat DASH diet, compared to the standard DASH diet ( 9 ).  Bottom Line: The higher-fat DASH diet reduced triglycerides, compared to the standard DASH diet, due to the lower carb content of the higher-fat diet.  Finding 3: Effects on LDL Peak Diameter  High levels of small, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease ( 10 ).  In the present study, the conventional DASH diet reduced the peak diameter of the LDL particles, but the higher-fat DASH diet increased the peak diameter, compared to the control diet.   This means that the higher-fat DASH diet may have caused a modest increase in LDL particle size.  In fact, there was a trend for higher levels of large LDL particles with the higher-fat DASH diet, but the findings were not significant.  Previous studies have shown that reduced carb and sugar intake may cause a shift from smaller to larger LDL particles, explaining the present findings ( 11 , 12 ).  Bottom Line: The higher-fat DASH diet increased LDL peak diameter, whereas the standard DASH reduced the LDL peak diameter. Large LDL size has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.  Finding 4: No Increase in LDL-Cholesterol  The higher-fat DASH diet did not increase levels of LDL-cholesterol, compared to the standard DASH diet.  This is inconsistent with studies showing that replacing carbs or unsaturated fats with saturated fats increases LDL-cholesterol ( 9 , 13 ).  The authors speculate that the DASH diet may have characteristics that prevent the rise in LDL-cholesterol typically associated with a higher intake of saturated fats.  Bottom Line: The higher-fat DASH diet did not increase LDL-cholesterol, compared to the standard DASH.  Limitations  This study appears to have been designed and implemented well.  It was a crossover trial, meaning that all participants were on all three diets during different study periods, separated by a 2-week washout period.  The purpose of the washout period was to prevent the previous diet from affecting the results of the next diet.  This washout, however, doesnât appear to have worked in all cases, since there were some prolonged effects of the higher-fat DASH diet on blood pressure. The reason for this is unexplained.  Other limitations include a small number of participants and a relatively short study period.  Bottom Line: This study did not have any serious limitations. However, the 2-week washout period between diets may not have been long enough with respect to blood pressure.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study shows that eating slightly more saturated dairy fat while on the DASH diet does not affect its beneficial effects on blood pressure.  Also, it did not have any adverse effects on the blood lipid profile.  A lower-carb, higher-fat DASH diet is a healthy, equally effective option, which may be easier to follow than the standard DASH diet.  Tags: Blood pressure , DASH diet , Saturated fat

	Eating Less May Prevent Disease and Help You Live Longer  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 11, 2016  In many animal species, such as monkeys, eating less has been linked to longer lifespans. However, this is much harder to measure in humans, since we live longer.  Therefore, a team of scientists decided to study how reducing calorie intake affects predictors of longevity. Their results were published in Journals of Gerontology: Medical Sciences .   Background  Calorie restriction refers to a diet that does not contain enough calories to maintain weight. Over time, this leads to significant weight loss or starvation, if the calorie restriction is severe.  However, during moderate calorie restriction, weight loss gradually slows down. This is known as the starvation response , or metabolic adaptation, and is characterized by a reduced metabolic rate.  Moderately restricting calories may have many health benefits, especially if you keep it up for a long time and get enough essential nutrients.  In many animals, such as rhesus monkeys, moderate calorie restriction increases lifespan and slows down the development of many age-related diseases ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  This is supported by observational studies in humans indicating that long-term calorie restriction may improve many risk factors of chronic disease ( 4 ).  Randomized, controlled trials have also shown that when overweight people follow a reduced-calorie diet for 6–12 months, many risk factors are improved ( 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Study Reviewed  A team of researchers examined the effects of moderate calorie restriction on predictors of longevity in normal-weight adults.  A 2-Year Randomized Controlled Trial of Human Caloric Restriction: Feasibility and Effects on Predictors of Health Span and Longevity.  Basic Study Design  This randomized, controlled trial studied the feasibility and safety of long-term, moderate calorie restriction. It also examined its effects on predictors for longevity.  To date, this is the largest study to examine the effects of long-term calorie restriction in adults. Non-obese men and women, aged 21–51 years, participated in the study for 2 years.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Calorie restriction: Participants in this group cut their daily calorie intake by 25%, designed to cause a 15.5% weight loss over 2 years.  Control: In this group, the participants changed none of their dietary habits.   At regular intervals during the study, the researchers measured several factors, including the change in resting metabolic rate, blood levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).  A total of 188 people completed the study, or 86% of those who started.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized, controlled trial examining the effects of sustained calorie restriction on predictors of longevity.  Finding 1. Calorie Restriction Slowed Metabolism  Metabolic rate is a measure of metabolism that estimates the amount of calories used by the body at a given time. In animals, a low resting metabolic rate (RMR) has been associated with increased life span ( 8 , 9 ).  In the present study, resting metabolic rate decreased significantly more in those who were on a reduced-calorie diet.   This difference in RMR across groups was mostly explained by the greater weight loss among those who were on a reduced-calorie diet.  However, starvation response was also responsible for some of it. Starvation response was estimated as the difference between measured and predicted RMR.  In the first year of the study, the participants lost 10% of their initial body weight, on average. But because of metabolic slowdown, body weight stabilized in the second year of the study.  Bottom Line: Sustained calorie reduction led to slower metabolism or a decreased resting metabolic rate (RMR). This was caused by weight loss as well as the starvation response.  Finding 2. Calorie Restriction Reduced Triiodothyronine (T3)  Triiodothyronine (T3) is a thyroid hormone that affects metabolism, body temperature and heart rate. Low thyroid activity has been associated with longevity in animals ( 10 ).  The present study showed that T3 decreased by more than 20% in those who were on a reduced-calorie diet, as shown in the chart below.   Bottom Line: Levels of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) decreased significantly on the reduced-calorie diet. Reduced T3 has been associated with longevity in animal studies.  Finding 3. Calorie Restriction Lowered TNF-α  Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is an inflammatory marker. High levels of TNF-α indicate systemic inflammation, and in animal studies, low levels of TNF-α have been associated with longevity ( 11 ).  In the present study, levels of TNF-α decreased significantly in those who were on a reduced-calorie diet, as shown in the chart below.   These findings are consistent with observational studies showing lower TNF-α in people who have been on a reduced-calorie diet for a long time ( 12 ).  Bottom Line: Calorie restriction caused a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker TNF-α, suggesting reduced systemic inflammation. Reduced TNF-α has been associated with longevity in animals.  Finding 4: Calorie Restriction Improved Heart Disease Risk Factors  Reducing calories also favorably affected many risk factors for heart disease, including:   Significant weight loss: The reduced-calorie diet led to a 10% reduction in body weight during the first year of the study, which was maintained in the second year.  Improved blood lipids: Levels of triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol decreased.  Lower blood pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure dropped.  Better blood sugar control: Insulin sensitivity improved.   Bottom Line: Calorie restriction led to significant weight loss, an improved blood lipid profile, lower blood pressure and better blood sugar control.  Potential Adverse Events  For most of the participants, moderately reducing calories did not appear to have any serious adverse effects. However, a few of the participants were withdrawn from the study due to health problems.  These included a decrease in bone mineral density, and anemia that didn’t improve with treatment. Additionally, one participant lost too much weight.  Overall, bone mineral density was significantly reduced in the calorie-restricted group, compared to the control group. However, these decreases were small.  This suggests that sustained calorie restriction may, over many years or decades, lead to osteoporosis and fractures.  However, it is unclear whether this is caused by calorie restriction itself or an insufficient intake of certain nutrients.  Bottom Line: Moderate calorie restriction is generally safe for most healthy people, as long as the intake of essential nutrients is sufficient. However, this may depend on the individual.  Limitations  This study appears to have been designed and implemented well, with no apparent limitations.  During the study, however, the calorie-restricted group only lost 10% of their initial body weight, not the expected 15.5%.  This is because the participants did not achieve the planned 25% calorie restriction, but only about 12%. Why this happened is unclear, but it might have been due to lack of compliance and/or an inaccurate study design.  Also, the study’s findings are limited to highly motivated, healthy, non-obese individuals. Sustained calorie restriction may have different effects in other groups.  Bottom Line: The study was planned and implemented well. However, participants did not achieve the planned 25% calorie restriction.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study showed that moderate, long-term calorie restriction is both feasible and safe for healthy, non-obese people.  Although the effects on life span couldn’t be measured directly, a reduced-calorie diet improved several health aspects related to longevity.  Simply put, moderately reducing calories may have many potential benefits, as long as the intake of essential nutrients is adequate.  In some cases, however, reducing calories can be downright harmful. If you are not overweight, consult with your doctor before going on a reduced-calorie diet.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Dec 31st–Jan 8th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 8, 2016  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, Dec 31st, 2015, to Friday, Jan 8th, 2016.   Research Reviews  In the past week, we reviewed two articles: one from Obesity Reviews , and the other from Nutrition & Diabetes .   Review : A Healthy Body Clock May Reduce The Risk of Weight Gain.  Study : Chronobesity: role of the circadian system in the obesity epidemic.  Summary : This was a review of the body clock’s role on weight maintenance, and how disrupting it may lead to weight gain. Abnormal sleeping patterns and irregular eating should be avoided.   Review : The Mineral Phosphorus May Help You Lose Weight.  Study : Effect of phosphorus supplementation on weight gain and waist circumference of overweight/obese adults: a randomized clinical trial.  Summary : This was a randomized, controlled trial examining how phosphorus supplementation affected weight loss. Supplementing with phosphorus for 12 weeks led to significant weight loss, compared to a placebo.   New Research From Around the World  Every week, we go over hundreds of recent articles published in nutrition and medical journals, selecting the most interesting and relevant ones.  Below is this week’s selection, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Metabolic Syndrome  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Appetite and Eating  Muscles and Physical Performance  Lung Health  Skin Health  Women’s Health  Pregnancy    Obesity and Weight Loss  Gradual reduction of sugar in soft drinks without substitution as a strategy to reduce overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes: a modelling study.  This study calculated the weight loss that would take place if the sugar content of all soft drinks was reduced by 40%, over a 5-year period.  The study found that body weight in British adults would, on average, decrease by 1.20 kg (2.6 lbs), reducing the prevalence of adult obesity from 35.5% to 34.5%.   Dietary protein intake is associated with body mass index and weight up to 5 y of age in a prospective cohort of twins.  This prospective, observational study of young twins examined the association of protein intake, BMI and obesity from the age of 2 to 5.  The study suggests that high protein intake at the age of 2, shortly after weaning, is associated with increased incidence of obesity when they are 3 years of age. This association was not significant when the children were 5 years old.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Egg consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that eating eggs does not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.  However, eating more than 3 eggs per day, on average, may cause a modest increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes. This association was significant only in US studies, but not in other countries.   Physical activity and weight loss are independent predictors of improved insulin sensitivity following energy restriction.  This study of obese adults indicates that physical activity is just as important as calorie restriction when it comes to improving insulin sensitivity.   Green Tea Extract and Catechol-O-Methyltransferase Genotype Modify Fasting Serum Insulin and Plasma Adiponectin Concentrations in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Overweight and Obese Postmenopausal Women.  This large, randomized controlled trial compared the effects of decaffeinated green tea extract to a placebo in overweight and obese adults.  The study found no significant differences in body weight, BMI or waist circumference across groups. However, the green tea extract reduced fasting insulin levels in those who had elevated insulin at the start of the study.   Association of Early Exposure of Probiotics and Islet Autoimmunity.  This observational study examined the association of probiotic supplementation and islet autoimmunity in children genetically predisposed to type 1 diabetes (T1D).  The study suggests that supplementing with probiotics early in life may reduce the risk of islet autoimmunity for children who have a high risk of T1D.   Heart Health  Effects of a beverage rich in (poly)phenols on established and novel risk markers for vascular disease in medically uncomplicated overweight or obese subjects: a four week randomized trial.  This randomized, controlled trial in overweight or obese adults examined the effects of drinking a beverage containing 361 mg of polyphenol antioxidants, every day for 4 weeks, on risk markers for vascular disease.  The beverage, which contained flavonoids, hydroxycinnamates and vitamin C, had no beneficial effects on risk factors for vascular disease.   Comparison of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and a higher-fat DASH diet on blood pressure and lipids and lipoproteins: a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized, crossover trial in healthy individuals compared the effectiveness of the standard DASH diet and the high-fat, low-carb DASH diet.  The study showed that the high-fat, low-carb DASH diet lowered blood pressure similarly to the standard DASH diet.   Metabolic Syndrome  Total and Full-Fat, but Not Low-Fat, Dairy Product Intakes are Inversely Associated with Metabolic Syndrome in Adults.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of dairy products may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome.  When full-fat and low-fat dairy products were investigated separately, only full-fat dairy products reduced the risk of metabolic syndrome.   Cancer  Sugar Promotes Breast Cancer.  This mouse study found that table sugar intake promoted breast cancer growth, compared to a placebo.   Brain Function and Mental Health  The role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in the treatment of major depression and Alzheimer’s disease: Acting separately or synergistically?  This review discusses the role of the omega-3 fats, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the prevention of major depression and Alzheimer’s disease.   Iron Status Is Associated with Performance on Executive Functioning Tasks in Nonanemic Young Women.  This observational study in women indicates that better iron status may lead to faster reaction time and better planning ability. Conversely, better iron status was associated with worse working memory.   Antenatal dietary patterns and depressive symptoms during pregnancy and early post-partum.  This observational study suggests that an unhealthy dietary pattern may increase the risk of depression during pregnancy or after delivery. An unhealthy diet was low in fish, fruit, vegetables and whole grains.   Habitual coffee consumption and risk of cognitive decline/dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that higher coffee consumption may protect against the development of Alzheimer’s disease.   Intakes of fish and PUFAs and mild-to-severe cognitive impairment risks: a dose-response meta-analysis of 21 cohort studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that eating fish may reduce the risk of dementia.  Additionally, the omega-3 fat docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was associated with a lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.   Relationship between daily isoflavone intake and sleep in Japanese adults: a cross-sectional study.  Isoflavones are a class of plant compounds found in legumes. This observational study suggests that higher isoflavone intake may improve sleep duration and quality in Japanese people.   Cinnamon users with pre-diabetes have a better fasting working memory: a cross–sectional function study.  Working memory is an important brain function responsible for processing new and old information (memories), and plays an essential role in learning, comprehension and reasoning. It is impaired in people with pre-diabetes.  This observational study suggests that cinnamon may improve working memory in people with pre-diabetes.   Appetite and Eating  Brain regulation of appetite in twins.  This experiment showed that appetite, and changes in appetite after a meal, estimated using an MRI scan, are very similar in monozygotic twins.  These results suggest that at least some aspects of appetite may be inherited.   Dietary fat restriction increases fat taste sensitivity in people with obesity.  This 6-week study in obese people showed that a low-fat or a portion-controlled diet increased sensitivity to the taste of fat. This applied especially to the low-fat diet, but following these diets did not change food preferences.  These results support previous studies suggesting that excess fat intake makes people less sensitive to the taste of fat.   What is eaten when all of the foods at a meal are served in large portions?  This experiment found that when meal portion sizes were increased, people were more likely to select foods that were of low or medium calorie density.   Higher Eating Frequency Does Not Decrease Appetite in Healthy Adults.  This small, randomized crossover study showed that eating small, frequent meals does not reduce appetite, compared to eating fewer, larger meals.   Capsaicin-induced satiety is associated with gastrointestinal distress but not with the release of satiety hormones.  Capsaicin , found in chili peppers, has been associated with increased fullness after meals. This small, randomized controlled trial showed that the fullness is caused by digestive distress — pain, nausea and bloating.   Muscles and Physical Performance  In a single-blind, matched group design: branched-chain amino acid supplementation and resistance training maintains lean body mass during a caloric restricted diet.  This randomized trial showed that supplementation with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) helps people maintain muscle mass while on an 8-week, calorie-restricted strength exercise program.   Nutritional Research May Be Useful in Treating Tendon Injuries.  A few studies have investigated the effects of nutrition on tendon injuries, suggesting that protein and certain amino acids may be useful. This review discusses the available evidence.   Leucine partially protects muscle mass and function during bed rest in middle-aged adults.  Inactivity leads to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, especially in older adults. Leucine is an amino acid that may help people maintain their muscle mass.  This randomized, controlled trial in middle-aged adults showed that a leucine supplement, 0.06 grams per kg of body weight, protected muscle mass during 14 days of bed rest.   Protein Supplementation at Breakfast and Lunch for 24 Weeks beyond Habitual Intakes Increases Whole-Body Lean Tissue Mass in Healthy Older Adults.  This 24-week, randomized controlled trial in healthy older adults showed that supplementing with milk protein, 0.165 grams for per kg body weight, increased lean body mass by 0.45 kg, compared to a reduction of 0.27 kg in the control group.  These results suggest that supplementing with protein may help preserve lean mass, including muscle mass, in healthy older adults.   Lung Health  The use of omega-3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis.   Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that mostly affects the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and frequent lung infections. It also adversely affects the digestive system, liver and kidneys.  This Cochrane review concludes that supplementing regularly with omega-3 fatty acids may benefit people with cystic fibrosis. However, there is still not enough evidence for any solid conclusions.   Skin Health  Cocoa Flavanol Supplementation Influences Skin Conditions of Photo-Aged Women: A 24-Week Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial.  Cocoa is rich in antioxidants, such as flavanols. This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of drinking a cocoa beverage, containing 320 mg of cocoa flavanols, on facial wrinkles and skin elasticity.  The study showed that drinking this high-flavanol cocoa beverage for 24 weeks improved both wrinkles and skin elasticity.   Melatonin Supplementation for Children With Atopic Dermatitis and Sleep Disturbance. A Randomized Clinical Trial.   Atopic dermatitis , also called eczema, is a skin condition that causes the skin to become dry and itchy. Scratching then causes it to become red, cracked and swollen.  This randomized, controlled trial found that supplementing with melatonin, 3 mg/day for 4 weeks, reduced the severity of atopic dermatitis in children. It also reduced the time it took for them to fall asleep at night.   Vitamin D: A New Promising Therapy for Congenital Ichthyosis.  Congenital ichthyosis (CI) is a genetic skin disorder characterized by dry, flaky or cracked skin. Severe vitamin D deficiency is very common in children with this condition.  This study shows that children with CI benefit from high-dose vitamin D supplementation. After one month, their skin had become almost normal, indicating that vitamin D supplementation may be an effective treatment for CI.   Women’s Health  Association between vitamin C Intake and the risk of cervical neoplasia: A meta-analysis.  Cervical neoplasia is characterized by abnormal growth of the cells lining the cervix. It is not a cancer, but may increase the risk of cervical cancer if left untreated.  This observational study suggests that high vitamin C intake may reduce the risk of cervical neoplasia. This association was dose-dependent.   Serum Antioxidants Are Associated with Serum Reproductive Hormones and Ovulation among Healthy Women.  This observational study indicates that high blood levels of antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, may improve women’s reproductive health.   Pregnancy and Infant Health  Maternal anemia and risk of adverse birth and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries: systematic review and meta-analysis.  This observational study shows that deficiency in red blood cells (or hemoglobin) is a major cause of ill health and death among pregnant women in developing countries.  Anemia can be treated with an iron-rich diet or supplements.   Prenatal supplementation with Corn Soya Blend Plus reduces the risk of maternal anemia in late gestation and lowers the rate of preterm birth but does not significantly improve maternal weight gain and birth anthropometric measurements in rural Cambodian women: a randomized trial.  Corn Soya Blend Plus is a dietary supplement, enriched with vitamins, that helps women meet their nutritional requirements during pregnancy.  This randomized trial in pregnant Cambodian women showed that Corn Soya Blend Plus reduced the risk of anemia during pregnancy and preterm birth, compared to women who got a normal diet. However, it also increased the risk of fetal loss.  Tags: Weekly recap

	The Mineral Phosphorus May Help You Lose Weight  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 6, 2016  Observational studies suggest that people who eat more phosphorus gain less weight.  However, the effects of phosphorus supplementation on weight loss have never been studied in humans.  For this reason, a team of scientists recently conducted a study. Below is a detailed summary of their results, published in Nutrition & Diabetes .   Background  Phosphorus is a dietary mineral that is essential for every cell in the body.  Most of it is found in your bones and teeth. In plants and animals, phosphorus is bound to oxygen, forming phosphate .  Phosphate is found in most food in varying amounts, but the best dietary sources are dairy products, meat and fish ( 1 ).  Even though cereals and legumes are also rich sources of phosphorus, most of it is found in the form of phytate or phytic acid , which is poorly absorbed ( 2 ).  Interestingly, scientists have speculated that poor phosphorus status may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity.  This claim is supported by observational studies associating low phosphorus status with increased body weight ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).  However, human trials are needed to confirm these findings.  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers from Beirut, Lebanon, conducted a study examining the effects of phosphorus supplementation on body weight.  Effect of phosphorus supplementation on weight gain and waist circumference of overweight/obese adults: a randomized clinical trial.  Study Design  This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in overweight, but otherwise healthy, adults aged 18â45 years.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Phosphorus group: Participants took phosphorus supplements with a meal 3 times a day for 12 weeks, amounting to 1,125 mg per day.  Placebo group: Participants took the same amount of a placebo.   At the beginning, middle and end of the study, the researchers measured body weight, waist circumference, subjective appetite scores, and fasting levels of phosphorus, creatinine , C-reactive protein , blood lipids, blood sugar and insulin.  A total of 47 participants completed the study, or 75% of those who were recruited.  Bottom Line: This was a 12-week, randomized controlled trial examining the effects of a phosphorus supplement on body weight and appetite.  Finding 1: Phosphorus Caused Weight Loss and a Reduction in Waist Circumference  At the end of the study, those in the phosphorus group had lower body weight, body mass index and waist circumference, compared to the placebo group, as shown in the chart below.  In the phosphorus group, body weight decreased by 0.65 kg (1.4 lbs), whereas body weight increased by 1.13 kg (2.5 lbs) in the placebo group.  These results are supported by observational studies suggesting that a poor phosphorus status may predispose people to weight gain ( 6 , 7 , 8 ).  As a possible explanation, a few human trials suggest that phosphorus intake may reduce appetite at a subsequent meal or increase metabolic rate ( 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ).  However, note that the present study is the first human trial to examine the effects of phosphorus on body weight. Further studies are needed to confirm its results.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with phosphorus caused weight loss and a reduction in waist circumference. These results need to be confirmed by further studies.  Finding 2: Phosphorus Reduced Appetite  In the phosphorus group, subjective ratings of appetite decreased.  These included appetite, the amount of food needed to reach fullness and the number of snacks eaten.  The findings are supported by one study in which phosphorus intake reduced food intake at a subsequent meal ( 9 ).  Bottom Line: Supplementing with phosphorus reduced subjective ratings of appetite.  Finding 3: Blood Levels of Phosphorus Did Not Increase  Levels of phosphorus in blood plasma did not increase among those participants who got phosphorus supplements.  This indicates that plasma phosphorus levels are not a good indicator of phosphorus intake, as confirmed by previous studies ( 13 , 14 ).  Bottom Line: The study suggests that phosphorus intake is not reflected in increased fasting levels of phosphorus in blood, supporting earlier findings.  Limitations  The study had no obvious major limitations.  However, the methods section of the article lacks information. For example, there is no information on the type of phosphorus/phosphate supplement used.  Additionally, phosphorus levels in blood plasma did not increase in people who got phosphorus supplements.  While this is supported by previous studies suggesting phosphorus levels in blood do not reflect intake, it also means the researchers were unable to test compliance.  Bottom Line: This study had no apparent limitations, but the paper is lacking information on the supplement that was used.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study showed that phosphorus supplements may promote weight loss.  They do this, most likely, by suppressing appetite and calorie intake.  Since this is the first study to show that phosphorus reduces body weight, further studies are needed to confirm its findings.  Tags: Minerals , Phosphorus , Weight loss

	A Healthy Body Clock May Reduce The Risk of Weight Gain  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  January 4, 2016  Many metabolic functions fluctuate throughout the day. These changes are regulated by your body’s internal clock, also known as the circadian rhythm .  Disrupting this system may contribute to weight gain and obesity.  Recently, a review article discussing the role of the body clock on weight maintenance was published in Obesity Reviews .   Article Reviewed  Researchers at the University of Leuven’s Gut Peptide Research Lab, in Belgium, reviewed the evidence about the body clock’s role in weight maintenance.  Chronobesity: role of the circadian system in the obesity epidemic.  What is the Body Clock?  The body clock is a biological rhythm present in almost all living things.  It regulates the 24-hour fluctuations in body activity, including hormones and other metabolic processes. It also helps the body prepare for sleep/wakefulness or food.  At the molecular level, the circadian system is driven by CLOCK genes , which are influenced by environmental information passed on by the brain and neurons ( 1 , 2 ).  A region in the brain, known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is often called the body’s master pacemaker because it is synchronized with the light/dark cycle.  The food-entrainable oscillator also appears to be involved with the circadian rhythm of feeding, but its rhythm is closely related to the SCN ( 3 , 4 ).  Interestingly, the activity and composition of the gut bacteria also changes over the 24-hour day, and is influenced by food intake ( 5 , 6 ).  Bottom Line: The body clock is the body’s timekeeping system that helps it prepare for sleep and wakefulness. This system is strongly affected by light exposure and food intake.  How Does the Body Clock Affect Weight?  The body clock helps the body anticipate and prepare for food intake.  Under natural conditions, food intake is influenced by food availability, hunger and appetite. Hunger and appetite are also strongly influenced by appetite hormones.  These hormones are regulated by the circadian system of feeding, which helps ensure that people maintain their weight, even when food availability is limited.  The circadian system also mediates food intake over the 24-hour day, suppressing appetite during the night, and increasing appetite during the day.  These fluctuations in appetite are reflected by the daily changes in the levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin . In healthy individuals, ghrelin levels are suppressed at night, but rise in the morning, peaking before meal time ( 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Bottom Line: The body clock controls changes in appetite over the 24-hour day. It is supposed to restrict food intake to waking hours, while at the same time ensuring that calorie intake is sufficient for weight maintenance.  Body Clock Disruption Promotes Weight Gain  Disrupting the body clock has been called chronodisruption, and is defined as a long-term disruption of the 24-hour circadian rhythm ( 10 ).  Several factors can cause a long-term disruption, including irregular sleeping, abnormal eating and a high-fat diet.  Abnormal Sleeping Patterns  Irregular sleeping is one of the most common disruptions to the circadian system. It is most often caused by shift work, frequent travelling across time zones or other nighttime disturbances.  During travel, this is called jet lag. Symptoms include poor sleep, poor mental and physical performance, fatigue, headache, irritability, indigestion and diarrhea ( 11 ).  Shift work often involves working during the night, or late into the night. Light exposure at night is one of the most important disruptions to the circadian system.  Several observational studies suggest shift work may increase the risk of various chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. This risk may also worsen over time ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ).  One study in healthy people examined the effects of shifting the sleeping time. When eating and sleeping times were 12 hours out of phase with what the participants were used to, levels of the satiety hormone leptin decreased ( 16 ).  Although disrupting appetite hormones seems to be involved, it remains to be explained exactly how irregular sleeping affects body weight.  Bottom Line: Irregular or abnormal sleeping patterns mess up the body’s timekeeping. Common causes include shift work and jet lag. This disruption may promote obesity, but human trials are lacking.  Irregular Eating Patterns  Body weight is not only affected by what and how much you eat — it is also affected by when you eat. Irregular eating can be caused by numerous factors, including disruptions to sleep caused by shift work, jet lag or nighttime sleep disturbances.  It may also be caused by adverse conditions, such as night-eating syndrome, which is associated with abnormal fluctuations in the levels of appetite hormones.  People who have night-eating syndrome consume most of their daily calories in the evening or night. They are also more likely to be overweight or obese, compared to healthy people ( 8 , 17 ).  This is supported by studies in mice and rats showing that nighttime eating causes significant weight gain, compared to daytime eating ( 18 , 19 ).  Irregular eating has also been found to cause adverse changes in the gut microbiota.  One high-impact study in both mice and humans showed that eating irregularly promoted an overgrowth of undesirable gut bacteria, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity ( 5 ).  Bottom Line: Irregular eating may also disrupt the body clock. This may lead to weight gain, especially when food intake is significant in the late evening or night.  Consuming a High-Fat Diet  A few studies indicate that a high-fat diet may also disrupt the body clock. One study in women showed that a high-fat diet reduced the average 24-hour levels of the satiety hormone leptin ( 20 ).  Another study in mice found that following a high-fat diet for a week led to increased food intake when the mice were normally resting. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of CLOCK genes ( 21 ).  Obesity caused by excessive calorie intake on a high-fat diet may also reduce the 24-hour fluctuations in the composition of the gut microbiota, resulting in the overgrowth of undesirable bacteria ( 22 ).  Bottom Line: High-fat diets have been implicated in the disruption of the body clock. However, further studies are needed.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This review showed that disrupting the body clock may contribute to weight gain and obesity. However, it also discussed some evidence-based strategies that may help you maintain healthy rhythms and reduce this risk.   Eat plenty of protein during the first meal of the day ( 23 , 24 ).  Eat lunch at noon and do not postpone it until later ( 25 ).  Include plenty of carbs in the last meal of the day ( 26 , 27 ).  Make sure that your last meal of the day is the lightest ( 28 ).  Avoid eating late and eat dinner at least 3 hours before bedtime ( 26 ).  Avoid eating too much fat ( 20 ).  Try to get high-quality sleep ( 29 , 30 ).  Exercise regularly to burn calories and improve sleep ( 31 ).  Keep your sleeping patterns regular ( 32 ).  Do not work during the night.  Block out blue light from electronic screens during the late evening ( 33 , 34 ).  Try to avoid frequent travelling across time zones.   Tags: Circadian rhythm , Obesity , Weight gain

	Past Weeks in Nutrition Science (Dec 18th–Dec 31st)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 31, 2015  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, Dec 18th, to Thursday, Dec 31st, 2015.   Research Reviews  In the past couple of weeks, we reviewed two articles: one from Diabetes Care , and the other from Obesity .   Review : Skipping Breakfast May Be Bad For Blood Sugar in Diabetics.  Study : Fasting until noon triggers increased postprandial hyperglycemia and impaired insulin response after lunch and dinner in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial.  Summary : This was a randomized, controlled trial examining the effects of skipping breakfast on blood sugar control after meals.  The study found that skipping breakfast may cause higher blood sugar levels after meals later in the day and into the evening. Although these results are consistent with previous studies, they might not apply to people who regularly skip breakfast.   Review : Carbs Have No Effect on The Starvation Response.  Study : Effects of carbohydrate quantity and glycemic index on resting metabolic rate and body composition during weight loss.  Summary : This randomized, controlled trial compared the effects of calorie-restricted, high-carb and moderate-carb diets on starvation response and body weight.  The main findings were that starvation response and weight loss were not affected by the amount of dietary carbs or the glycemic index.   New Research From Around the World  In the past couple of weeks, tons of new research articles were published. Below is a selection of some of the most interesting papers, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Brain and Mental Health  Appetite and Eating  Digestive Health  Kidney and Urinary Health  Women’s Health  Pregnancy  Healthy Aging  Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals    Obesity and Weight Loss  Water-induced thermogenesis and fat oxidation: a reassessment.  It’s generally recommended that people trying to lose weight should drink a lot of water. However, water consumption has not been found to affect calorie and fat metabolism in all studies.  This clinical experiment showed that drinking 500 ml of water caused a slight increase in calories burned.   Effect of phosphorus supplementation on weight gain and waist circumference of overweight/obese adults: a randomized clinical trial.  Observational studies suggest that good phosphorus status may reduce the risk of obesity. But until now, this had not been studied in a controlled trial.  This randomized, controlled trial showed that people who took phosphorus supplements 3 times a day for 12 weeks had a lower body weight at the end of the trial, compared to those who got a placebo.   Empty plates and larger waists: a cross-sectional study of factors associated with plate clearing habits and body weight.  This cross-sectional, observational study suggests that those who habitually clear their plates when eating are at a greater risk of becoming overweight.   Chronobesity: role of the circadian system in the obesity epidemic.  The body’s timekeeping mechanism, called the body clock, regulates metabolic activities throughout the 24-hour day.  Disruption of the body clock, due to shift work or poor sleep, may contribute to the development of obesity. This review discusses the available evidence and reasons.   Predicting adult obesity from childhood obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This observational study indicates that obese children and adolescents are 5 times more likely to become obese as adults, compared to those who were not obese.   Relationship between actigraphy-assessed sleep quality and fat mass in college students.  This study, which measured sleep quality in 132 healthy students for 12 days, showed that poor sleep quality was associated with higher fat mass.  These results suggest that getting a good night’s sleep may help prevent weight gain and obesity.   Comparison of the effect of daily consumption of probiotic compared with low-fat conventional yogurt on weight loss in healthy obese women following an energy-restricted diet: a randomized controlled trial.  This 12-week, randomized controlled trial in overweight and obese women compared the effects of a probiotic yogurt and a standard low-fat yogurt on the effectiveness of a weight loss program.  There were no significant differences in weight loss across groups. However, eating a probiotic yogurt caused some improvements in blood lipids and insulin sensitivity, compared to the standard low-fat yogurt.   The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: A randomized clinical trial.  This randomized clinical trial compared the effects of drinking water or water sweetened with non-nutritive sweeteners (710 ml/day) on body weight during a 1-year weight loss program.  The study showed that those who drank water with non-nutritive sweeteners lost more weight, compared to those who got pure water.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Taking myo-inositol as a dietary supplement during pregnancy to prevent the development of gestational diabetes.  Myo-inositol is a type of sugar alcohol produced by the human body and also found in cereals, green vegetables and meat.  According to this Cochrane review, myo-inositol supplementation is promising as a prevention for diabetes during pregnancy. However, the evidence is not good enough to recommend it for routine use.   Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of diabetes in the Japanese community: results from the Takayama study.  Several previous studies showed that magnesium intake may improve insulin resistance and blood sugar clearance in patients with type 2 diabetes.  This observational study suggests that magnesium intake may reduce the risk of diabetes, supporting previous studies. However, this effect was only seen in women.   Fish consumption and frying of fish in relation to type 2 diabetes incidence: a prospective cohort study of Swedish men.  This observational study found no significant association between total fish consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes.  However, it suggests that high consumption of shellfish or fried fish may increase the risk of diabetes.   Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations in Children Progressing to Autoimmunity and Clinical Type 1 Diabetes.  This observational study suggests that vitamin D status is not associated with type 1 diabetes in Finnish children.   The Role of Energy, Nutrients, Foods, and Dietary Patterns in the Development of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies.  This is a systematic review of observational studies investigating the association of dietary factors with diabetes during pregnancy, also called gestational diabetes.  It suggests that high intake of fruit, vegetables, whole grains and fish may protect against gestational diabetes. Conversely, a high intake of red or processed meat, refined grains and high-fat dairy may increase the risk.   Low Carbohydrate-Diet Scores and Long-term Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Among Women With a History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective Cohort Study.  This observational study examined the association of low-carb dietary patterns with the risk of type 2 diabetes among women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy.  The study suggests that a low-carb diet, high in protein and fat from animal sources, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Conversely, a low-carb diet, high in protein and fat from plant sources, was not associated with an increased risk.   Hypomagnesemia in Type 2 Diabetes: A Vicious Circle?  Poor magnesium status has been strongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Human trials have also shown that magnesium supplementation improves blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity.  This review discusses the available evidence and potential means. It also suggests magnesium deficiency in type 2 diabetes may be a part of a vicious cycle, since insulin resistance may deplete magnesium stores in the body.   A randomized controlled clinical trial investigating the effect of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation on markers of insulin metabolism and lipid profiles in gestational diabetes.  This 6-week, randomized controlled trial showed that taking 1,000 mg of omega-3 fatty acids each day, along with 400 IU of vitamin E, benefits blood sugar control and blood lipids in pregnant women with diabetes.   Heart Health  Metabolic syndrome, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and 10-year Cardiovascular Disease Incidence: the ATTICA Study.  This observational study suggests that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of heart disease.   Plasma Ascorbic Acid, A Priori Diet Quality Score, and Incident Hypertension: A Prospective Cohort Study.  This prospective observational study indicates that high vitamin C intake, and overall diet quality, may reduce the risk of high blood pressure.  However, vitamin C from supplements was not associated with improved blood pressure. This indicates that vitamin C itself is not the cause for these improvements, but that other dietary or lifestyle factors are responsible.   Effects of potassium supplementation on markers of osmoregulation and volume regulation: results of a fully controlled dietary intervention study.  Previous studies have shown that potassium supplementation may reduce blood pressure, especially when sodium intake is unrestricted.  This randomized, crossover trial found that supplementing with potassium for 4 weeks reduced blood pressure, even when sodium intake was restricted.   Soft drink consumption, mainly diet ones, is associated with increased blood pressure in adolescents.  This cross-sectional, observational study suggests that drinking soft drinks is associated with higher blood pressure.  The association was stronger among those who drank diet sodas, compared with sugar-sweetened beverages.   A blend of sesame oil and rice bran oil lowers blood pressure and improves the lipid profile in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients.  Sesame oil and rice bran oil are high in unsaturated fatty acids as well as antioxidants, and have been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.  This study showed that supplementing with a blend of sesame oil and rice bran oil may reduce blood pressure and improve the blood lipid profile of hypertensive patients.   Alcohol consumption and risk of coronary artery disease: a dose–response meta-analysis of prospective studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that moderate consumption of alcohol may reduce the risk of heart disease — specifically coronary artery disease — compared to abstaining or drinking too much.  The optimal intake was estimated to be 36 grams of ethanol per day.   Cancer  Comparative Efficacy of Vitamin D Status in Reducing the Risk of Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that a high intake of vitamin D may reduce the risk of bladder cancer.   Interaction between Red Meat Intake and NAT2 Genotype in Increasing the Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Japanese and African Americans.  This meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that the consumption of processed meat, and total red meat intake, is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in both Japanese people and African Americans.  This association was strongest among those who were genetically predisposed to colorectal cancer, specifically those who had the NAT2 genotype .   A review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of red and processed meat, meat cooking methods, heme iron, heterocyclic amines and prostate cancer.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that the consumption of red meat and processed meat is not associated with prostate cancer risk.   Fish oil supplementation during chemotherapy increases posterior time to tumor progression in colorectal cancer.  This clinical study showed that for colorectal cancer patients, taking 2 g/day of fish oil during the first 9 weeks of chemotherapy may slow down cancer growth.   Rubus occidentalis: The black raspberry—its potential in the prevention of cancer.   Black raspberries are very rich in antioxidants, such as anthocyanins and ellagitannin .  Their potential health benefits have been studied in test-tube experiments, mainly focusing on their anticancer effects. This review summarizes the available evidence.   Coffee consumption and the risk of cutaneous melanoma: a meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that drinking coffee may reduce the risk of cutaneous melanoma, one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer.   Coffee consumption and the risk of incident gastric cancer—A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that drinking large amounts of coffee may, over time, increase the risk of stomach cancer.   Brain and Mental Health  Dietary fiber intake and depressive symptoms in Japanese employees: the Furukawa Nutrition and Health Study.  This observational study suggests that eating lots of fruit, vegetables and fiber may reduce symptoms of depression in Japanese workers.   Cognitive effects of intentional weight loss in elderly obese individuals with mild cognitive impairment.  This controlled trial showed that losing weight, through a dietary weight loss program, improved cognition in obese, elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment.   The efficacy of early iron supplementation on postpartum depression, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.  This was a randomized controlled trial in new mothers suffering from depression after delivery, which is known as postpartum depression .  The study showed that supplementing with iron, 50 mg of elemental iron every day for 6 weeks from the first week after delivery, improved their iron stores and reduced symptoms of depression.   Appetite and Eating  Impact of food labelling systems on food choices and eating behaviours: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized studies.  Food labels are considered an effective way to improve people’s food choices, and reduce the risk of chronic disease and obesity.  This meta-analysis of randomized studies supports this, suggesting that food labeling may help consumers select healthier products. Interpretive or traffic light labels are possibly the most helpful.   Visual exposure to large and small portion sizes and perceptions of portion size normality: Three experimental studies.  This article discusses three experiments on how people perceive portion sizes. It concluded that when people are routinely exposed to large portion sizes, they start perceiving them as normal. However, this did not apply to snack food intake.   Digestive Health  Vitamin D status in relation to Crohn’s disease: meta-analysis of observational studies.  Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the digestive system. This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that vitamin D status is associated with Crohn’s disease.  Not only are patients with Crohn’s disease more likely to be vitamin D deficient, but the severity of the disease also seems to be greater in those with the lowest levels of vitamin D.   Probiotics for the prevention antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children.  Antibiotics may disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the digestive system, causing increased growth of undesirable bacteria. This may lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  This Cochrane review of clinical trials suggests that probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children.   Kidney and Urinary Health  Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children.  This Cochrane review concludes that there is no evidence that probiotics reduce urinary tract infections in adults and children.   Protein Diet Restriction Slows Chronic Kidney Disease Progression in Non-Diabetic and in Type 1 Diabetic Patients, but Not in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials Using Glomerular Filtration Rate as a Surrogate.  This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that eating less protein, or restricting protein intake, may slow the development of chronic kidney disease in non-diabetic people and those with type 1 diabetes.  Conversely, protein restriction does not seem to improve kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.   Women’s Health  Effects of long-term folate supplementation on metabolic status and regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a condition characterized by abnormal growth of the cells lining the cervix. It is not a type of cancer, but may potentially develop into cancer if left untreated.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with folate, 5 mg/day for 6 months, may help treat CIN stage 1, compared to a placebo. Additionally, it improved insulin sensitivity and reduced oxidative stress.   Pregnancy  Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating the Effects of a Low-Glycemic Index Diet on Pregnancy Outcomes in Women at High Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: The GI Baby 3 Study.  This randomized, controlled trial compared the effects of a diet with a low glycemic index (low-GI diet) and a conventional high-fiber diet (HF-diet) on pregnancy outcomes in women at a high risk of getting diabetes during pregnancy.  There was no difference in pregnancy outcomes across groups, as both the low-GI diet and the HF-diet had similar health effects.   Vitamin D activity of breast milk in women randomly assigned to vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy.  Human milk is generally low in vitamin D. This randomized, controlled trial is the first study to examine the effects of supplementing with vitamin D during pregnancy on vitamin D levels in breast milk after delivery.  The study showed that when pregnant women take 2,000 IU/day of vitamin D, from week 36 of pregnancy until delivery, the vitamin D levels in their milk were higher than with a placebo for at least 2 months afterwards.   Healthy Aging  The conserved role of protein restriction in aging and disease.  Previous studies in both animals and humans indicate that reducing protein intake may help prevent many age-related diseases and increase longevity.  This review concludes that excessive protein consumption may have detrimental effects over time. However, eating too little protein is unhealthy as well. The optimal intake is somewhere in between and may increase with age.   Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals  Exercise performed immediately after fructose ingestion enhances fructose oxidation and suppresses fructose storage.  Previous studies have shown that exercise may prevent the adverse effects of excessive fructose consumption.  This study confirmed previous findings. Exercising immediately after consuming fructose increased its oxidation and decreased fructose storage. Conversely, exercising before consuming fructose had no effects.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Carbs Have No Effect on The Starvation Response  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 29, 2015  Sustained, long-term weight loss is difficult for many people. One reason is because the body adapts to weight loss, which is known as starvation response .  During starvation response, metabolic rate (or calories burned) is reduced. Dietary factors may also play a part, but studies debate this ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Recently, a team of scientists looked into how carbs affect starvation response and body weight. Here is a detailed summary of their results, published in Obesity .   Study Reviewed  A group of scientists compared the effects of a moderate-carb diet and a high-carb diet on weight loss, body composition and starvation response.  Effects of Carbohydrate Quantity and Glycemic Index on Resting Metabolic Rate and Body Composition During Weight Loss.  Basic Study Design  This double-blind, randomized controlled trial investigated how carbs in calorie-restricted diets affect body weight, body composition, resting metabolic rate and starvation response. The participants were obese adults, aged 45 to 65 years.  The study was divided into 4 phases. The first three phases had a controlled diet, provided by the study’s kitchen. During the last phase, the participants were free to eat as much as they wanted to.   Phase 1. Weight maintenance: This 5-week phase determined how many calories participants needed to maintain a stable weight.  Phase 2. Experiment: In this 12-week phase, the participants were randomly assigned to one of four diets (see below). These 4 diets were calorie-restricted, and had about 67% of the calories required to maintain a stable weight.  Phase 3. Weight maintenance: During this 5-week phase, the participants had their calorie intakes adjusted so they would maintain their weight.  Phase 4. Follow-up: For 12 months, the participants selected and prepared their own meals, but were provided with instructions to follow their assigned diets.   The 4 diets assigned in phase 2 varied the amounts of carbs, as well as the glycemic index (GI). Those who ate fewer carbs ate more fat instead.   Moderate-carb, high-GI diet: This diet provided 54%, 29% and 16% of calories from carbs, fat and protein, respectively, and had a glycemic index of 80.  Moderate-carb, low-GI diet: This diet provided 54%, 31% and 16% of calories from carbs, fat and protein, respectively, and had a glycemic index of 51.  High-carb, high-GI diet: This diet provided 70%, 14% and 16% of calories from carbs, fat and protein, respectively, and had a glycemic index of 86.  High-carb, low-GI diet: This diet provided 68%, 16% and 15% of calories from carbs, fat and protein, respectively, and had a glycemic index of 59.   Throughout the study, the researchers measured body weight, body composition and resting metabolic rate. Starvation response was calculated as the difference between predicted and measured resting metabolic rate.  Of the 107 participants that initially started the study, 79 completed phases 1â3, but only 60 made it to the end.  Bottom Line: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of moderate-carb and high-carb diets, and high- and low-GI diets, on starvation response, body composition and body weight.  Finding 1: Carbs Did Not Affect Starvation Response  At the end of phase 2, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was 6.5% lower, on average, compared to at the beginning of the study.  Some of the decline in RMR was predicted to happen with weight loss, but the actual measured reduction was slightly greater than predicted.  This difference, which amounted to 54 kcal/day, on average, was assumed to be accounted for by the starvation response. The chart below shows the differences in starvation response during phase 2 across groups.   Bottom Line: Neither the amount of carbs nor the glycemic index had any significant effects on starvation response or the total reduction in RMR during the study.  Finding 2: The Diets Caused Similar Weight Loss  On average, the study participants lost 7.5% of their original body weight during the study, mostly in phase 2. However, weight loss did not significantly differ across groups.   These results indicate that when a calorie-controlled weight loss diet contains moderate to high amounts of carbs, variations in the ratio of carbs to fat do not change the effectiveness of the diet.  This study, however, did not compare the effectiveness of high- or moderate carb diets with a low-carb diet. A low-carb diet is much lower in carbs than the diets tested in the current study.  Bottom Line: Moderate-carb and high-carb diets had similar effects on weight loss. These results cannot be generalized to low-carb diets, which were not examined in the present study.  Finding 3: Glycemic Index Did Not Affect Weight Loss  The glycemic index measures how foods affect the rise in blood sugar after a meal. In the present study, weight loss did not significantly differ by the glycemic index of the diet.  This is supported by previous studies showing that the glycemic index of a particular diet has no effects on weight loss when calories are controlled ( 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Bottom Line: The glycemic index of the diets had no effects on weight loss in the current study.  Finding 4: Carb Amount Did Not Affect Weight Loss Quality  The quality of weight loss refers to how much fat mass is lost relative to muscle mass.  When you go on a weight loss diet, you usually lose both fat mass and muscle mass (lean mass), but the ratio may vary. If relatively little muscle mass is lost, the quality of the weight loss is high.  In the present study, neither the carb content nor the glycemic index (GI) of the diet had any effects on the ratio of the loss of fat mass and lean mass, as shown in the chart below.   Various factors may affect the quality of weight loss. These include strength exercises, protein intake and eating pattern.  However, the present study makes it clear that carbs are not one of those factors, at least not when the carbs are at moderate or high levels.  Bottom Line: Neither the carb amount nor the glycemic index of the diets had any effects on weight loss quality, or the ratio of the reduction in fat mass and lean mass.  Finding 5: Carb Amount Did Not Affect Weight Regain  During phase 4 of the study, the participants were allowed to eat as much as they wanted, but were given instructions to follow their diets from phase 2.  On average, the participants regained 4.3 kg (9.5 lbs) during phase 4, or about 58% of the weight they lost.  Weight regain did not differ across groups, and was not associated with variations in resting metabolic rate or the starvation response. This means that the amount of carbs eaten did not predict weight regain after dieting had stopped.  Bottom Line: The carb amount of the weight loss diets did not affect weight regain after dieting had stopped.  Limitations  This study does not have any serious weaknesses in its design or execution.  However, only 56% of participants made it to the end, which means the dropout rate was very high. There are also a few issues that limit how the results can be generalized.  First, the study compared moderate- to high-carb diets. The difference in the amounts of carbs on the high-carb (70%) and moderate-carb diets (54%) may not have been sufficient enough to cause significant differences in weight loss.  Second, the study wasn’t designed to cause a huge amount of weight loss. With greater energy restriction, the results might have been different.  Third, adherence to the diets may not have been perfect. In fact, there were some indications that calorie intake may have been slightly higher than prescribed.  Finally, calories were controlled in the current study. The results may have been different on an ad libitum (eat until fullness) diet.  Bottom Line: This study appears to have been well designed and implemented. However, the results cannot be generalized to low-carb diets, and the dropout rate was very high.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Starvation response was not affected by the amount of dietary carbs or the glycemic index, at least not when carb intake was moderate to high. Likewise, weight loss did not differ across groups.  This is not to say that reducing carbs can’t be beneficial for weight loss. Plenty of studies have shown that reducing carbs can be a very effective weight-loss strategy.  This study, however, replaced carbs with fat, while keeping protein intake unchanged. Additionally, it did not examine the effects of a low-carb diet.  The present findings are of limited use for people trying to lose weight. They are, however, of greater value for science, helping us understand how carbs affect body weight on a calorie-restricted diet.  Tags: Carbs , Starvation response , Weight loss

	Skipping Breakfast May Be Bad For Blood Sugar in Diabetics  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 22, 2015  Studies show that skipping breakfast may cause higher peaks in blood sugar levels for people with type 2 diabetes.  To investigate this further, a team of scientists examined the effects of fasting until noon on the rise in blood sugar levels after lunch and dinner.  The results were recently published by the American Diabetes Association.   Background  To a large extent, blood sugar control is affected by the body’s inner clock, also known as the circadian clock ( 1 ).  The circadian clock explains why the body’s metabolic activity and the production of hormones fluctuates over the day and night.  For example, the rise in blood sugar is higher after a meal in the evening, compared to an identical meal eaten in the morning ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Additionally, fasting until noon may disrupt the circadian rhythm, causing an elevated blood sugar rise after meals in both healthy individuals and people with type 2 diabetes ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Study Reviewed  This trial examined the effects of skipping breakfast on post-meal blood sugar control after an identical lunch and dinner.  Fasting Until Noon Triggers Increased Postprandial Hyperglycemia and Impaired Insulin Response After Lunch and Dinner in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial.  Basic Study Design  This was a randomized crossover trial in 22 overweight or obese men and women. All participants had type 2 diabetes and were used to eating breakfast regularly.  Participants were randomly assigned to one of two test groups:   Breakfast: Everyone in this group ate breakfast at 8 AM, lunch at 1:30 PM and dinner at 7 PM.  No breakfast: People in this group did not eat breakfast, and continued their overnight fast until noon. Then they ate two identical meals for lunch (1:30 PM) and dinner (7 PM).   The participants were asked to follow the study’s meal pattern for 2 days before each test day. All meals had an identical calorie and macronutrient content, with about 701 kcal, 20% fat, 26% protein, 54% carbs and 7% fiber.  The study had a crossover design, which means that all participants were in both groups on different days, separated by 2â4 weeks.  Before and after meals, the researchers measured various blood variables, including blood sugar, insulin, free fatty acids and glucagon.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized crossover trial in adults with type 2 diabetes. Its main purpose was to examine the effects of skipping breakfast on blood sugar control.  Finding 1: Skipping Breakfast Impaired Blood Sugar Control  Skipping breakfast and fasting until noon caused higher blood sugar levels after lunch and dinner, compared to eating breakfast.  Fasting until noon led to 40% and 25% higher peaks in blood sugar levels after lunch and dinner, respectively.  The chart below shows the differences in peak levels of post-meal blood sugar levels between test days.   The higher blood sugar levels were partly explained by lower insulin levels and a delay in the production of insulin.  In fact, insulin levels peaked 30 minutes later after lunch when breakfast was skipped. This delay in the insulin response was even greater after dinner, or 60 minutes later.  The chart below shows the differences in post-meal peak levels of insulin between test days.   What’s more, levels of glucagon , which is a hormone that increases blood sugar levels, were also higher after lunch and dinner on no-breakfast days.  These findings indicate that skipping breakfast impairs blood sugar control later in the day, causing higher post-meal peaks in blood sugar levels.  Additionally, the peaks in insulin levels after lunch and dinner were 24.7% and 10.8% lower, respectively, when breakfast was skipped.  These findings are supported by many previous studies. In fact, breakfast seems to be of major importance for blood sugar control ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ).  The beneficial effect of breakfast seems to be more pronounced when a large portion of the daily calories are eaten in the morning ( 16 , 17 ).  Several factors may affect the delay in insulin response after skipping breakfast:   Second meal phenomenon: The cells of the pancreas may produce more insulin, and respond faster, if they’ve had to produce insulin earlier in the day ( 9 , 18 , 19 ).  Fasting: Starvation or fasting may temporarily reduce the activity of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas ( 20 ).  Disrupted circadian rhythm: Sleeping and eating regularly is healthy. Sudden changes in this pattern may cause a disruption in various metabolic systems, including those involved with blood sugar control ( 21 , 22 ).   Bottom Line: Skipping breakfast resulted in impaired blood sugar control in diabetic people who were used to eating breakfast.  Finding 2: Fasting Until Noon Increased FFAs  Skipping breakfast also increased the levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) after meals later in the day.  Specifically, the levels of FFAs were 41% and 30% higher after lunch and dinner, respectively, compared to breakfast days.  This may have health relevance, since FFAs are associated with insulin resistance ( 23 ).  Bottom Line: Skipping breakfast also resulted in higher levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) after meals. The health relevance of this is unclear, but high levels of FFAs have been associated with insulin resistance.  Limitations  The design and execution of the study had no apparent limitations. However, its results may not apply to everyone.  For example, the study focused on people with type 2 diabetes. Although previous studies have found similar effects in healthy people, we can’t say for sure if the results can be generalized to non-diabetics ( 8 ).  Second, the results may not apply to those who always skip breakfast. People’s circadian rhythms may adjust to different eating patterns over time ( 24 ).  Finally, the test meals in the present study had a relatively high protein content, or about 45 grams per meal. If the meals had provided less protein, the study’s findings might have been different ( 25 ).  Bottom Line: The study had no obvious limitations. However, the results may not be generalized to everyone.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Skipping breakfast causes higher blood sugar levels after meals later in the day, and these effects may persist into the evening.  Conversely, eating breakfast may have beneficial effects on your blood sugar levels for the rest of the day. This may be especially important if you are diabetic and are accustomed to eating breakfast regularly.  The findings are consistent with many previous studies, showing that fasting until noon may impair blood sugar control in both healthy and diabetic people.  This may not, however, apply to those who always skip breakfast. The body may adapt to a fixed meal schedule.  Tags: Blood sugar , Breakfast , Diabetes , Fasting

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Dec 11th–Dec 18th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 18, 2015  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, Dec 11th, to Friday, Dec 18th, 2015.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two articles — one from the International Journal of Obesity , and the other from Clinical Nutrition .   Review : Eating Late at Night Burns Fewer Calories.  Study : Is the timing of caloric intake associated with variation in diet-induced thermogenesis and in the metabolic pattern? A randomized cross-over study.  Summary : This randomized, crossover trial compared the effects of breakfast and dinner on metabolic rate. Breakfast caused a greater increase in calories burned, compared to an identical meal eaten in the evening.   Review : Probiotics May Lower Blood Sugar in Diabetics.  Study : Clinical application of probiotics in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Summary : This randomized trial examined the effects of fermented goat’s milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis , compared to milk with Streptococcus thermophilus .  L. acidophilus and S. thermophilus had beneficial effects on blood sugar control and blood lipids.   New Research From Around the World  Many research articles and reviews were published this week. As usual, we selected the most interesting or relevant articles and categorized them by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Infections and Immune Health  Pregnancy Health  Sports Nutrition    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Decreasing the number of small eating occasions (<15 % of total energy intake) regardless of the time of day may be important to improve diet quality but not adiposity: a cross-sectional study in British children and adolescents.  This observational study suggests that meal or snack frequency has no effects on body weight in British children and adolescents.   Control of overweight and obesity in childhood through education in meal time habits. The ‘good manners for a healthy future’ programme.  In this study, adolescents were given instructions to eat slower but not change meal size. After one year, those who were given advice to eat slower had lost 3.4% of their body weight, while the control group experienced an 8.2% weight gain.   A comparison of effects of lard and hydrogenated vegetable shortening on the development of high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats.  This mouse study found that a lard-based, high-fat diet promoted weight gain, obesity and insulin resistance more than a high-fat diet based on hydrogenated vegetable shortening.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Indices of dietary fat quality during mid-pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes Quality of dietary fat and gestational diabetes.  This observational study suggests that high dietary intake of a type of fat called alpha-linoleic acid may protect against diabetes during pregnancy.   Acute effect of red meat and dairy on glucose and insulin: a randomized crossover study.  This randomized crossover trial compared the effects of a dairy meal and a red meat meal on blood sugar and insulin. Both meals contained equal amounts of carbs.  The study found that dairy and red meat had similar effects on the post-meal increase in blood sugar and insulin.   3. Heart Health  Irregularity of energy intake at meals: prospective associations with the metabolic syndrome in adults of the 1946 British birth cohort.  This observational study indicates that irregular eating patterns may increase the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke.   Astaxanthin has no effect on arterial stiffness, oxidative stress, or inflammation in renal transplant recipients: a randomized controlled trial (the XANTHIN trial).  Astaxanthin is an antioxidant that has been shown to reduce inflammation. Inflammation is linked to atherosclerosis , which causes the arteries to narrow and stiffen.  This randomized controlled trial in kidney transplant recipients found that supplementing with astaxanthin, 12 mg per day for 12 months, had no effects on inflammation, arterial stiffness or oxidative stress.   Is there a causal role for homocysteine concentration in blood pressure? A Mendelian randomization study.  Elevated levels of homocysteine have been associated with various chronic diseases, such as heart disease. Fortunately, B-vitamins can help lower these levels.  However, whether homocysteine has any direct role in heart disease is a matter of debate. This observational study did not find any significant links between homocysteine levels and the risk of high blood pressure.   Effects of grape seed extract beverage on blood pressure and metabolic indices in individuals with pre-hypertension: a randomised, double-blinded, two-arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial showed that drinking juice containing 300 mg of grape seed extract, every day for 6 weeks, caused a significant decrease in blood pressure in people with pre-hypertension.   A systematic review and meta-analysis of nut consumption and incident risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that eating a lot of nuts may lower the risk of death from heart disease.   Beneficial Effects of Omega 3 and Vitamin E Co-Administration on Gene Expression of SIRT1 and PGC1α and serum antioxidant enzymes in patients with Coronary Artery Disease.   This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with both omega-3 fat (4 g/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) for two months may improve the health of patients with coronary heart disease.  More specifically, omega-3 and vitamin E reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and appeared to increase the expression of health-associated genes.   Association of Coffee Consumption With Total and Cause-Specific Mortality in 3 Large Prospective Cohorts.  This observational study suggests that drinking coffee may reduce the risk of death from heart disease, neurological diseases and suicide.   4.

	Probiotics May Lower Blood Sugar in Diabetics  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 16, 2015  Imbalanced gut microbiota may be one of the underlying causes of type 2 diabetes, and changing this environment may help improve symptoms.  Recently, a team of scientists examined the effects of beneficial, probiotic bacteria on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetics.  Here is a detailed summary of their findings, published in Clinical Nutrition .   Background  Type 2 diabetes has been associated with dysbiosis — an imbalance in the bacterial community in the gut ( 1 ).  Two studies even suggest that high numbers of undesirable gut bacteria may play a direct role in the development of type 2 diabetes ( 2 , 3 ).  Supplementing regularly with probiotics may help change the gut environment. In diabetics, Lactobacillus probiotics may have beneficial effects on blood sugar control and blood lipids ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Study Reviewed  A group of scientists from Brazil looked at the effects of probiotic supplementation on several markers of diabetes.  Clinical application of probiotics in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Basic Study Design  This was a 6-week, randomized controlled trial examining the effects of probiotics on blood sugar control, blood lipids and inflammatory markers.  A total of 45 men and women with type 2 diabetes participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Probiotic group: Participants in this group consumed 120 grams of fermented goat’s milk every day for 6 weeks. The milk contained two kinds of probiotics, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis .  Control group: Participants in this group consumed 120 grams of conventional, fermented goat’s milk per day. It contained the probiotic Streptococcus thermophilus .   At the beginning and the end of the study, the researchers measured blood sugar markers, insulin, blood lipids and inflammatory markers.  Bottom Line: This was a 6-week, randomized controlled trial examining the effects of probiotics on blood sugar control, blood lipids, inflammation and other health factors in people with type 2 diabetes.  Finding 1: Probiotics Improved Blood Sugar  HbA1c is short for glycated hemoglobin . It forms when hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen throughout the body, joins with sugar (glucose).  Your HbA1c levels indicate how high your blood sugar levels have been in the past weeks or months, on average.  Like HbA1c, fructosamine is a glycated protein that reflects blood sugar levels in the previous 2 or 3 weeks.  In the present study, HbA1c and fructosamine both decreased significantly in the group that received probiotics. The graph below shows the results for fructosamine:   Conversely, fasting levels of blood sugar, insulin or insulin resistance did not change in either group. Taken together, these findings suggest that probiotics may improve blood sugar control in type 2 diabetics.  This is supported by previous studies showing that eating yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus for 6–8 weeks may reduce blood sugar and HbA1c in diabetic individuals ( 4 , 5 ).  Bottom Line: Drinking goat’s milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis appeared to improve fructosamine and HbA1c levels, compared to goat’s milk containing Streptococcus thermophilus .  Finding 2: Probiotics Improved Blood Lipids  There was a significant difference in the changes in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol between groups, as seen in the chart below.   Levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol increased significantly in the control group, but went down slightly in the probiotics group.  HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides did not change in either group.  Previous studies have also shown that Lactobacillus acidophilus may reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in type 2 diabetics ( 6 , 7 ).  Bottom Line: Drinking milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis promoted a better blood lipid profile, compared to milk that contained Streptococcus thermophilus .  Finding 3: Goat’s Milk May Reduce Inflammation  Systemic inflammation may be an underlying factor in the development of type 2 diabetes ( 8 ).  Therefore, the researchers measured levels of several inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and resistin .  TNF-α and resistin decreased significantly in both groups over the course of the study. For this reason, the researchers concluded that drinking fermented goat’s milk may improve inflammation.  Bottom Line: Drinking fermented goat’s milk that contained probiotics appeared to reduce inflammation. This happened in both groups.  Limitations  This study had several shortfalls.  First, levels of HbA1c were significantly higher in the probiotic group at the beginning of the study. This might have affected the decrease in HbA1c in the probiotic group.  Second, the control group got fermented milk that contained the probiotic bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus , which may have health benefits different from those of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis ( 9 ).  In a controlled trial, the experimental and control groups must not differ from each other except through the variables that are to be tested, which in this case are the probiotic effects of L. acidophilus and B. animalis .  For this reason, the study may not have had a true control group.  Bottom Line: The study’s design is questionable and it had a few limitations that make its results difficult to interpret.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study suggests that the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis may have health benefits in people with type 2 diabetes, compared to Streptococcus thermophilus .  They improved the blood lipid profile and appeared to have beneficial effects on blood sugar control.  This study adds to the growing evidence that probiotic bacteria can have wide-ranging health benefits.  Tags: Blood sugar , Diabetes , Probiotics

	Eating Late at Night Burns Fewer Calories  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 14, 2015  Eating food causes a temporary increase in metabolic rate, or calories burned. This is known as diet-induced thermogenesis, or the thermic effect of food (TEF).  Some studies indicate that TEF may be higher in the morning. Therefore, a team of researchers set out to examine how meal timing affects TEF.  Here is a detailed summary of their findings, recently published in the International Journal of Obesity .   Background  The body’s metabolic activities fluctuate throughout the day. For example, the metabolic responses to a meal are different in the morning than later in the day.  Most notably, insulin sensitivity is higher in the morning, causing faster blood sugar clearance after a meal. It decreases as the day goes on, reaching its lowest point during the night ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Previous studies have also found that the rise in metabolic rate after a meal, or TEF, is higher in the morning than in the evening ( 4 , 5 ).  Although TEF is only responsible for about 10% of the body’s total calorie expenditure, it is believed to play a role in the development of obesity ( 6 ).  In fact, several observational studies suggest that consuming a large part of your daily calories in the evening is associated with an increased risk of obesity ( 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Additionally, one randomized weight-loss trial also showed that a high-calorie breakfast caused greater weight loss than a high-calorie dinner ( 10 ).  However, the available evidence is not entirely conclusive. Studies suggest that skipping breakfast, and eating more in the evening and afternoon, has no effect on calories burned over a 24-hour period ( 11 ).  What’s more, one large randomized controlled trial, which we reviewed last September, showed that skipping breakfast for 4 months has no effects on body weight in overweight and obese adults ( 12 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers from Turin, Italy compared the effects of breakfast and dinner on blood sugar control and the post-meal increase in the body’s metabolic rate.  Is the timing of caloric intake associated with variation in diet-induced thermogenesis and in the metabolic pattern? A randomized cross-over study.  Basic Study Design  The main purpose of this randomized crossover trial was to compare the effects of breakfast and dinner on post-meal metabolic rate. It also examined the effects on blood sugar control and free fatty acids.  A total of 20 normal-weight men and women participated in the study. They were randomly divided into one of two groups:   Morning: Participants in this group got a standardized meal at 8 AM.  Evening: Participants in this group got an identical meal at 8 PM.   The meal had a relatively high protein content, or 30% of total calories. The fat and carb content were 31% and 39% of total calories, respectively.  A high protein content is known to promote calorie expenditure, or a greater thermic effect of food ( 13 , 14 ).  The trial had a crossover design, which means that the participants who got breakfast on the first day got dinner a week later, and vice versa.  The researchers measured resting metabolic rate, blood sugar, insulin and free fatty acids before each meal and again after the meal was finished.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized crossover trial that compared the effects of a standardized high-protein breakfast and dinner on metabolic rate (calories burned), blood sugar control and free fatty acids.  Finding 1: Earlier Meals Burned More Calories  The amount of calories burned was significantly greater after the morning meal, compared to the later meal, as seen in the chart below.   These findings are supported by a few previous studies ( 4 , 5 ).  Several factors may explain these differences. First, levels of the hormone epinephrine are higher in the morning than later in the day. Epinephrine may increase metabolic rate ( 15 , 16 ).  Second, insulin resistance may decrease metabolic rate, possibly explaining why it is lower in the evening ( 16 , 17 ).  Bottom Line: An early meal caused a greater increase in metabolic rate and calorie expenditure than an identical meal eaten in the evening.  Finding 2: Earlier Meals Affected Free Fatty Acids Less  In the study, the levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) increased less after the early meal, compared to the later meal.   Previous studies support these results. Circulating FFAs have been reported to be higher around noon or in the afternoon, compared to early morning ( 1 , 18 ).  Although elevated levels of FFAs are perfectly normal after a meal that contains fat, increased base levels of FFAs have been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome ( 19 ).  Bottom Line: The levels of free fatty acids increased less after earlier meals, compared to meals eaten later on.  Finding 3: Earlier Meals Raised Blood Sugar Levels Less  Blood sugar and insulin levels were significantly lower after earlier meals, compared to later meals.   This aligns with previous studies ( 1 , 2 ).  A few factors may be responsible for these effects:   Gastric emptying is slower in the evening, possibly leading to more efficient carb absorption ( 20 , 21 ).  Free fatty acids may impair blood sugar control ( 22 , 23 ).  Hormones fluctuate throughout the day ( 24 , 25 , 26 ).   Bottom Line: Later meals caused a greater increase in glucose and insulin levels, compared to earlier meals. This indicates that blood sugar control is not as efficient in the evening.  Limitations  This study appears to have been well designed and implemented. However, its results may not apply to all situations.  The test meal contained a relatively high amount of protein, or 30% of total calories. If the meal had contained a less protein, the differences resulting from timing may have been less pronounced.  Additionally, all of the subjects were of normal weight. These results need to be confirmed in overweight or obese people.  Bottom Line: The study was well planned and executed. However, the test meal had a high protein content and all participants were of normal weight, which may limit the generalizability of the results.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study suggests that meal timing is important for weight loss and maintenance.  An early meal resulted in more calories burned, compared to eating the same meal later on. The early meal also led to smaller increases in free fatty acids and blood sugar levels.  Taken together, the available evidence indicates that eating a greater proportion of calories earlier in the day, and avoiding big meals at night, may be useful for losing weight.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Dec 4th–Dec 11th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 11, 2015  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, Dec 4th, to Friday, Dec 11th.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two articles — one from the British Journal of Nutrition and the other from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Review:  The Food Additive MSG May Help You Eat Fewer Calories.  Study:  Monosodium l-glutamate in soup reduces subsequent energy intake from high-fat savoury food in overweight and obese women.  Summary: This randomized crossover trial examined the effects of monosodium glutamate (MSG), a food additive, on appetite and calorie intake in overweight and obese women.  The study showed that when participants ate a soup seasoned with MSG, they ate fewer calories at the lunch buffet that followed.   Review:  Sugary Drinks Make You Eat More.  Study:  No difference in ad libitum energy intake in healthy men and women consuming beverages sweetened with fructose, glucose, or high-fructose corn syrup: a randomized trial.  Summary: This study examined the effects of fructose-sweetened beverages on calorie intake, and compared them with beverages sweetened with glucose, high-fructose corn syrup or aspartame.  The study’s main finding was that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages promotes higher calorie intake, compared to aspartame-sweetened beverages.   New Research From Around the World  Every week, a large amount of research articles are published online.  Using feed services, we scan the headlines of over 100 nutrition and medical journals, selecting the most relevant and interesting articles.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Inflammation  Sports Nutrition  Vegetarian Diets    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Prawn Shell Chitosan Has Anti-Obesogenic Properties, Influencing Both Nutrient Digestibility and Microbial Populations in a Pig Model.  Chitosan is a carbohydrate processed from the shells of crustaceans, such as prawns, crabs and lobsters.  This study in pigs suggests that eating chitosan may reduce the risk of obesity. Pigs that got chitosan ate less, lost weight and had lower leptin levels. Chitosan also seemed to increase the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.   Little appetite for obesity: meta-analysis of the effects of maternal obesogenic diets on offspring food intake and body mass in rodents.  This meta-analysis of rodent studies suggests that the calorie intake of pregnant mothers does not affect appetite in their offspring, at least not when their calorie intake is adequate.  However, mothers on a weight-gain diet tended to have heavier offspring.   Perceived weight status and risk of weight gain across life in US and UK adults.  This observational study suggests that those who regard themselves as being overweight are at a greater risk of gaining weight in the future.  This association was significant, regardless of whether people were correct or incorrect about their weight status.   Adenovirus 36 infection: a role in dietary intake and response to inpatient weight management in obese girls.  Previous studies suggest that infection with adenovirus 36 (Adv36) is more common among children who are overweight or obese. This study did not find any significant differences in calorie intake between Adv36-positive and Adv36-negative girls.  However, being infected with Adv36 seemed to promote a greater decrease in abdominal obesity, but less decrease in skin fat, compared to Adv36-negative girls.   Adenovirus 36 DNA in human adipose tissue.  This study in 21 overweight or obese adults showed that 4 of them (19%) were infected with the human adenovirus 36 (Adv36).  The virus was detected in visceral fat samples. Currently, it is unclear what effects Adv36 has on fat cells. Further studies are needed.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Protein source in a high-protein diet modulates reductions in insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in fa/fa Zucker rats.  This rat study compared the effects of casein, soy protein and mixed proteins on insulin resistance and liver fat. The mixed-protein diet most effectively reduced insulin resistance and liver fat, while casein had minimal effects.  These findings suggest that the type of protein may play a role. Additionally, specific amino acids may be responsible for the benefits of protein on insulin resistance and liver fat.   Effects of intraduodenal hydroxycitrate on glucose absorption, incretin release and glycemia in response to intraduodenal glucose infusion in health and type 2 diabetes – a randomised controlled trial (NUT-D-15-00649 revised version).  Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is derived from the fruit Garcinia cambogia , and is marketed as a weight loss supplement. It has beneficial effects on blood sugar control in rodents, but its effects in humans are unknown.  This clinical study showed that 2,800 mg of HCA had modest benefits for blood sugar control in healthy adults. It had no significant benefits in people with type 2 diabetes.   Serum folate levels and fatality among diabetic adults: a 15-year follow-up study of a national cohort.  This observational study showed that high levels of circulating folate were associated with a greater risk of death from diabetes, as well as all other causes.   Clinical Application of Probiotics in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.  Dysbiosis is a term that refers to an unhealthy imbalance of the bacterial community in the digestive system. Type 2 diabetes has been associated with dysbiosis.  This randomized controlled trial of people with type 2 diabetes found that drinking 120 grams a day of fermented, probiotic milk for 6 weeks improved blood sugar control significantly. It also reduced markers of systemic inflammation.   3. Heart Health  Rice bran oil and canola oil improve blood lipids compared to sunflower oil in women with type 2 diabetes: A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial .  This was a randomized controlled trial of type 2 diabetics. It found that taking 30 grams a day of canola oil or rice bran oil, for 8 weeks, improved blood lipid levels, compared to sunflower oil. However, these oils did not affect HDL cholesterol.   Beneficial effects of Bifidobacterium lactis on lipid profile and cytokines in patients with metabolic syndrome: a randomized trial.  This randomized trial in people with metabolic syndrome showed that drinking probiotic milk containing Bifidobacterium lactis , 80 ml per day for 45 days, reduced body weight and improved levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.  Additionally, the probiotics improved markers for systemic inflammation.   Coffee and caffeine consumption and the risk of hypertension in postmenopausal women.  This observational study in postmenopausal women suggests that drinking coffee or decaffeinated coffee does not increase the risk for hypertension.   Weight loss therapy for clinical management of patients with some atherosclerotic diseases: a randomized clinical trial.  Atherosclerosis , characterized by the hardening and narrowing of arteries, is a common cause of heart attacks and strokes. This randomized controlled trial showed that an effective weight loss program may help treat atherosclerosis.   4. Cancer  Inflammatory potential of diet and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III Study.  This observational study indicates that a pro-inflammatory diet, which scores high on the dietary inflammatory index, is associated with a higher risk of death from cancer or heart disease.   5. Appetite and Eating  The impact of sugar sweetened beverage intake on hunger and satiety in minority adolescents.  This randomized crossover study suggests that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages may decrease fullness during a meal. However, drinking sugar-sweetened beverages also appeared to suppress ghrelin .   Is the timing of caloric intake associated with variation in diet-induced thermogenesis and in the metabolic pattern? A randomized cross-over study.  Eating causes a temporary increase in calories burned, sometimes called the thermic effect of food (TEF). Some studies indicate that the TEF is higher in the morning.  This trial also found that the TEF was higher after a morning meal, compared to the same meal eaten in the evening. The later meal also led to a greater increase in blood sugar.   6. Brain and Mental Health  Associations between obesity and cognition in the pre-school years.  This observational study suggests that boys who were obese when they were 3 years old were less intelligent at the age of 5, compared to normal-weight children.   25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Deficiency Independently Predicts Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.  This observational study indicates that vitamin D deficiency may impair cognitive performance in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus , an autoimmune disease.   Intakes of folate, vitamin B6 and B12 and risk of depression in community-dwelling older adults: the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Aging.  This observational study suggests that high intake of vitamin B6 from food may reduce the risk of depression in elderly women. Conversely, high intake of vitamin B12 appeared to reduce the risk of depression in elderly men.   7. Inflammation  Nigella sativa oil with a calorie-restricted diet can improve biomarkers of systemic inflammation in obese women: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.  Nigella sativa is a plant whose seeds are used as a spice in India and the Middle East. It is also known as nigella or kalonji.  This randomized controlled trial showed that taking 3 grams of nigella a day for 8 weeks, while on a low-calorie diet, caused greater improvements in markers of systemic inflammation, compared to a placebo.   8. Sports Nutrition  A 9-week docosahexaenoic acid-enriched supplementation improves endurance exercise capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in adult rats.  This rat study indicates that supplementation with the long-chain omega-3 fatty acid DHA may improve endurance.   Short-term creatine supplementation has no impact on upper-body anaerobic power in trained wrestlers.  This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with creatine for 5 days, 0.3 grams a day for each kg of body weight, had no effects on upper-body muscle power in trained wrestlers.   Effects of Pomegranate Juice in Circulating Parameters, Cytokines and Oxidative Stress Markers in Endurance-Based Athletes: A Randomised Controlled Trial.  This randomized controlled trial suggests that drinking pomegranate juice, 200 ml per day for 3 weeks, may reduce the oxidative damage caused by endurance exercise.   9. Vegetarian Diets  Mortality in vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians in the United Kingdom.  This observational study suggests that vegetarians and non-vegetarians from the UK have a similar all-cause risk of dying.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Sugary Drinks Make You Eat More  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 9, 2015  People who drink sugar-sweetened beverages tend to gain more weight over time.  However, it is not known whether all types of sugar are equally fattening.  For this reason, a team of scientists recently examined how different forms of sugar affect calorie intake.  Here is a detailed summary of their results, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Background  Sugar-sweetened beverages are a major source of calories in Western society ( 1 ).  Studies suggest that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages promotes excessive calorie intake, weight gain and obesity ( 2 ).  Several factors could explain this:   Liquid calories bypass the body’s appetite-regulating system. They are simply added on top of normal calorie intake ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Fructose doesn’t stimulate insulin release when ingested. For this reason, it may not suppress appetite as strongly as glucose ( 7 ).   However, exactly how or why this happens is not fully understood, and further studies are needed.  Study Reviewed  Scientists from Seattle examined the effects of fructose-sweetened beverages on calorie intake, and compared it with beverages sweetened with glucose, high-fructose corn syrup or aspartame.  No difference in ad libitum energy intake in healthy men and women consuming beverages sweetened with fructose, glucose, or high-fructose corn syrup: a randomized trial.  Basic Study Design  This study was based on the secondary analysis of two randomized, controlled crossover trials.  The main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of fructose-sweetened beverages on calorie intake, and to compare it with glucose, high-fructose corn syrup (trial B) or aspartame-sweetened beverages (trial A).  Trial A  A total of 9 healthy, normal-weight adults participated in this trial. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups:   Fructose: For 8 days, the participants consumed 4 servings of a fructose-sweetened beverage every day.  Glucose: During the same period, the participants consumed 4 servings of a drink sweetened with glucose. A small amount of aspartame was also added to match the sweetness of the fructose.  Aspartame: In this control group, the participants consumed 4 servings of aspartame-sweetened beverages per day.   The amount of glucose and fructose consumed daily was equivalent to 25% of each subject’s estimated calorie requirement. Conversely, the aspartame-sweetened drink provided only 4% of their estimated calorie needs.  The study had a crossover design, which means that all participants were in each of the three groups on different weeks, separated by 20 days.  All participants spent 8 days in each group, during which the study kitchen provided them with standardized food, or an amount equivalent to 125% of their estimated calorie requirements.  Trial B  A total of 24 healthy adults completed this trial. Half of them were overweight or obese, whereas the rest were normal-weight.  They were randomly assigned to one of three groups:   Fructose: For 8 days, the participants consumed beverages sweetened with fructose. As in trial A, the daily amount was divided between 4 servings.  Glucose: Participants in this group consumed fructose-sweetened beverages instead of glucose. A small amount of aspartame was added to make the sweetness equal to that of the fructose beverage.  High-fructose corn syrup: In this group, the participants got beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, which is essentially a mixture of fructose and glucose. A small amount of aspartame was also added.   Otherwise, trial B was identical to trial A.  Bottom Line: This study used data from two small randomized controlled trials examining the effects of fructose on calorie intake, and comparing it with glucose, high-fructose corn syrup or aspartame.  Finding 1: Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Increased Calorie Intake  In trial A, calorie intake was significantly higher among those who got 25% of their estimated calorie needs from sugar-sweetened beverages, compared to those who got aspartame.  Glucose- and fructose-sweetened beverages increased calorie intake equally.  The chart below shows the differences in calorie intake between groups, presented as the percent of estimated calorie requirement:   These results are supported by studies showing that sugar-sweetened beverages consistently promote weight gain ( 2 , 6 ).  In the present study, body weight did not change significantly between groups. This is probably explained by the low statistical power of the study, and its short duration.  Bottom Line: Sugar-sweetened beverages increase calorie intake, compared to beverages sweetened with aspartame. For this reason, they may promote long-term weight gain.  Finding 2: Fructose and Glucose Increased Calorie Intake Equally  Fructose, glucose and high-fructose corn syrup all had similar effects on calorie intake. Also, no differences were detected when the participants were divided into subgroups based on gender or body weight.  The chart below shows the differences in calorie intake between groups in trial B, presented as the percent of estimated calorie requirement.   These findings are in line with previous studies ( 8 , 9 ).  Bottom Line: Fructose, glucose and high-fructose corn syrup increased calorie intake to the same extent. Put simply, liquid sugar promotes weight gain, regardless of the type of sugar.  Limitations  The study was well planned and executed. However, it had several limitations.  First, both trials recruited a small number of participants, especially trial A, which included only 9 participants. This limited the statistical power, and means that smaller but significant findings may have been missed.  However, trial B included a greater number of participants than trial A, and was based on proper sample-size calculations.  Second, both trials were intentionally of short duration to prevent adverse health effects, such as weight gain. But this means that the results may not necessarily be generalized to longer periods.  Additionally, in trial A, the participants in the fructose and glucose groups were provided with more calories, or a total of 150% of their calorie requirements, compared to those in the aspartame group, which received only 129%.  This difference might have contributed to the differences in calorie intake between groups.  Finally, the participants were provided with a standardized diet that did not include snack foods high in sugar and fat. This limits the generalizability of the results further.  Bottom Line: The study was well planned and implemented. However, it had a few shortfalls that might have affected the results and limited the generalizability of the results.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, consuming sugar-sweetened beverages leads to a higher calorie intake, compared to aspartame-sweetened beverages.  Fructose, glucose and high-fructose corn syrup all had a similar effect. This indicates that liquid sugar increases calorie intake, regardless of the type of sugar.  Simply put, if you care about your weight, you should avoid sugar-sweetened beverages.  Tags: Sugar , Weight gain

	The Food Additive MSG May Help You Eat Fewer Calories  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 7, 2015  Studies have shown that the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) may reduce appetite.  However, this has only been examined in normal-weight adults, and the results have been inconsistent. For this reason, a group of researchers decided to research MSG consumption in overweight and obese women.  Here is a detailed summary of their findings, recently published in the British Journal of Nutrition .   Background  Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a type of seasoning. It’s well known for its umami taste , which is also known as the fifth taste.  MSG is composed of glutamic acid, a type of amino acid connected to sodium (salt). By making foods more tasty, it may be able to reduce appetite after meals.  This may be because it affects appetite centers in the brain. By binding to umami taste receptors, MSG may signal the brain and promote the release of satiety (appetite-reducing) hormones ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  However, clinical trials have provided inconsistent results.  Several studies have examined the effects of MSG on appetite and calorie intake. In a few long-term studies in institutionalized elderly people, MSG had no effects on calorie intake or body weight ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  Similarly, another study showed that adding MSG to soup had no significant effects on subsequent appetite or calorie intake ( 7 ).  One study even found that adding MSG to a high-protein meal increased calorie intake at the next meal, without affecting appetite ( 8 ).  Conversely, three other studies suggest that adding MSG to chicken broth or soup may reduce feelings of hunger and the desire to eat, resulting in a lower calorie intake after the meal ( 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Study Reviewed  A group of researchers set out to examine the effects of MSG on appetite and calorie intake in overweight and obese women.  Monosodium L-glutamate in soup reduces subsequent energy intake from high-fat savoury food in overweight and obese women.  Basic Study Design  This was a randomized crossover trial. It included a total of 68 overweight or obese, but otherwise healthy, women. None of them had an eating disorder.  They were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   MSG group: Participants in this group got 200 ml of vegetable soup with an added 1 gram of MSG.  Control group: Participants in this group got 200 ml of vegetable soup with an added 1 gram of salt, but no MSG.   In both groups, the participants received the soup 10 minutes before a lunch buffet, and again 10 minutes before a snack buffet in the mid-afternoon.  The study had a crossover design, which means that all participants were in the MSG group and the control group on different days.  During the lunch and the afternoon snacks, the participants were allowed to eat as much as they wanted, until comfortably full.  Their food selection and calorie intake were measured. Also, throughout the test day, the participants’ appetites were assessed using a questionnaire.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized crossover trial that examined the effects of MSG on subsequent appetite and calorie intake.  Finding 1: MSG Caused Lower Calorie Intake  The MSG soup led to lower calorie intake at the lunch buffet. Calorie intake was also lower during the afternoon snacks, but the difference was not statistically significant.  The chart below shows the differences in calorie intake between groups.   These findings are supported by previous studies ( 10 ).  Bottom Line: Eating a soup seasoned with MSG led to a slightly lower calorie intake at a subsequent lunch buffet, compared to the soup without MSG.  Finding 2: MSG Influenced Food Choice  The MSG soup reduced the subsequent calorie intake from high-fat, savory foods â such as cheese, chicken nuggets and hummus â at the lunch and afternoon snack buffets. This might explain the reduced calorie intake at lunch.  Supporting this, one previous study found that a savory meal, containing MSG, reduced the consumption of high-fat, savory foods at a subsequent buffet, compared to a sweet or bland meal that did not contain MSG ( 12 ).  Bottom Line: MSG-seasoned soup reduced the intake of high-fat, savory foods at subsequent lunch or afternoon snack buffets.  Finding 3: MSG Increased Feelings of Hunger  The MSG-seasoned soup caused higher subjective ratings of hunger and lower ratings of fullness, compared to the soup without MSG.  This is intriguing, since higher hunger ratings would be expected to increase calorie intake. However, in previous studies, calorie intake and appetite ratings have not always been consistent ( 7 , 9 , 13 ).  The cause of this is unclear. It is possible that subjective ratings of appetite, using a visual analogue scale, are simply not accurate enough.  Bottom Line: The MSG-seasoned soup led to increased hunger and reduced fullness, compared to the soup without MSG.  Limitations  The study was well designed and implemented. However, it had a few minor limitations.  Eating a soup seasoned with MSG 10 minutes before lunch or other meals may not reflect everyday eating habits.  Additionally, this study examined the short-term effects of MSG. Eating MSG for longer periods, such as many days or weeks, might provide different results.  Finally, this study included only overweight or obese women. The results may not necessarily apply to men or healthy-weight individuals.  Bottom Line: The study was well planned and executed. It had a few minor issues, in regard to generalizing the results.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study found that eating a soup seasoned with MSG reduced subsequent calorie intake at a lunch buffet.  This is even though MSG increased the feeling of hunger. MSG also affected food choice, decreasing the consumption of high-fat, savory foods.  A few previous studies support these findings, but the evidence is inconsistent overall.  More studies are needed before adding MSG can be recommended for the purpose of weight loss.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Nov 27th–Dec 4th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 4, 2015  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, Nov 27th, to Friday, Dec 4th.   Research Reviews  As usual, we reviewed two articles this week. One was recently published in Cell , while the other appeared in Appetite .   Review : Blood Sugar Levels After a Meal Depend on the Individual.   Study : Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.  Summary : This study examined which factors caused individual variability in blood sugar responses after identical meals. The authors also developed an algorithm to predict blood sugar responses.  The study showed that the rise in blood sugar after meals is highly variable between individuals. This is explained by multiple factors, such as the types of bacteria present in people’s digestive system.   Review : Eating Garlic Makes Men Smell More Attractive.  Study : Consumption of garlic positively affects hedonic perception of axillary body odour.  Summary : Garlic may improve the smell of men’s armpit sweat, reducing its intensity, as rated by women. Sweat that smelled less strong was considered more attractive.  Hypothetically, this may be because garlic’s antibiotic properties reduce the growth or activity of the skin bacteria responsible for sweat-related body odor.   New Research From Around the World  Tons of new research articles were published this week. As usual, we categorize the articles by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart and Vascular Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Brain and Mental Health  Digestion and Gut Health  Bone Health  Eyes and Vision  Infant Health  Inflammation  Sports Nutrition  Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals    1. Obesity and Weight Loss  Promotion of Weight Gain in Early Childhood Does Not Increase Metabolic Risk in Adolescents: A 15-Year Follow-Up of a Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.  This observational study suggests that temporarily encouraging weight gain in 12–18 month old children, in an interventional study, does not make them more likely to be overweight 15 years later.  Also, they were not more likely to have high blood pressure or to have worse blood lipid profiles, compared to children who were not encouraged to gain weight.   Eating Frequency Is Positively Associated with Overweight and Central Obesity in US Adults.  This cross-sectional observational study suggests that eating often — high meal and snacking frequency — makes US adults more likely to be overweight or obese. Eating frequency was also associated with abdominal obesity.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  A high-fat, high-saturated fat diet decreases insulin sensitivity without changing intra-abdominal fat in weight-stable overweight and obese adults.   This trial in overweight and obese adults showed that following a high-fat, high-saturated-fat diet for 4 weeks reduced insulin sensitivity, even without weight gain. This suggests a high-fat diet may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.   Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Is Lower in US Adults Taking Chromium-Containing Supplements.  This observational study suggests that taking chromium supplements may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.   The Apparent Relation between Plasma 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Insulin Resistance Is Largely Attributable to Central Adiposity in Overweight and Obese Adults.  Previous research indicates that low circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with insulin resistance. This observational study suggests that central or abdominal obesity is mainly responsible.   Fish oil supplemented for 9 months does not improve glycaemic control or insulin sensitivity in subjects with impaired glucose regulation: a parallel randomised controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial found that taking fish oil, 6 grams every day for 9 months, did not improve blood sugar control for those with impaired blood sugar control.   No effect of modest selenium supplementation on insulin resistance in UK pregnant women, as assessed by plasma adiponectin concentration.  This randomized controlled trial in pregnant women showed that taking selenium supplements, 60 µg per day from the 12th week of pregnancy until delivery, had no effects on the hormone adiponectin , which is a marker of insulin resistance.  These findings suggest that moderate selenium supplementation does not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes during pregnancy.   3. Heart and Vascular Health  Vitamin D 3 supplementation does not modify cardiovascular risk profile of adults with inadequate vitamin D status.   This randomized controlled trial showed that supplementing with vitamin D3, 20 µg per day for 12 weeks, did not improve risk factors for heart disease in German people with inadequate vitamin D levels.   Being constipated: a bad omen for your cardiovascular system?  This scientific review discusses the association of constipation and poor health. It concludes that chronic constipation may be linked with several diseases, including heart disease and increased risk of death.   Whole Soy Flour Incorporated into a Muffin and Consumed at 2 Doses of Soy Protein Does Not Lower LDL Cholesterol in a Randomized, Double-Blind Controlled Trial of Hypercholesterolemic Adults.  Previous studies indicate that soy protein may lower LDL-cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease.  This randomized controlled trial examined whether soy flour had similar effects. The study showed that taking 12.5 or 25 grams of soy protein from soy flour daily for 6 weeks did not reduce LDL-cholesterol or other risk factors for heart disease.   Association between fried food consumption and hypertension in Korean adults.  This observational study in Korean women suggests that eating fried food frequently may increase the chance of high blood pressure.   4. Cancer  Advanced Glycation End-Products and Colorectal Cancer Risk.  Poor blood sugar control may promote the formation of glyceraldehyde , which promotes the formation of unhealthy compounds known as glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end products (glycer-AGEs).  This prospective observational study suggests that high levels of circulating glycer-AGEs may increase the risk of rectal cancer. However, glycer-AGEs were not linked with colon cancer.   Folate, vitamin B6 , vitamin B12 and methionine intakes and risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Chinese adults: a matched case–control study.  This observational study in Chinese adults suggests that folate and vitamin B6 may protect against cancer in the upper part of the pharynx.   Dietary inflammatory index and endometrial cancer risk in an Italian case–control study.  This observational study in Italian women indicates that eating a diet that promotes inflammation may increase the risk of cancer in the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus.   Specific serum carotenoids are inversely associated with breast cancer risk among Chinese women: a case–control study.  Carotenoids are a class of antioxidant pigments found in plants. The best known carotenoid is beta-carotene, which can be changed into vitamin A in the body.  This observational study in Chinese women suggests that high circulating levels of the carotenoids alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin may protect against breast cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Monosodium  l -glutamate in soup reduces subsequent energy intake from high-fat savoury food in overweight and obese women.  Some studies suggest that monosodium glutamate (MSG) may increase the feeling of fullness in normal-weight adults. However, not all studies have provided consistent results.  This randomized controlled trial showed that 200 ml of vegetable soup with 1 gram of MSG reduced subsequent calorie intake, compared to the same soup without MSG.   6. Brain and Mental Health  The plausibility of maternal toxicant exposure and nutritional status as contributing factors to the risk of autism spectrum disorders.   This scientific review discusses the possibility that toxicants or micronutrients in the pregnant mother‘s diet may increase the risk of autism in the child.   Vitamin D Status Is an Independent Risk Factor for Global Cognitive Impairment in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.  Previous studies have identified vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for mental impairment. This observational study examined this association in peritoneal dialysis patients.  Peritoneal dialysis is a mechanical process that helps clean the blood of patients with poor kidney function. The study found that vitamin-D-deficient peritoneal dialysis patients had an increased risk of cognitive impairment.   Abnormal fatty acids in Canadian children with autism.  This study showed that autistic Canadian children had lower levels of certain fatty acids in their red blood cells, compared to healthy children.  These fatty acids were docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid and the ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.   Malnutrition and Its Determinants Are Associated with Suboptimal Cognitive, Communication, and Motor Development in Tanzanian Children.  This observational study in Tanzanian children indicates that chronic malnutrition may cause delays in brain and mental development.   Acute effects of a wild green-oat (Avena sativa) extract on cognitive function in middle-aged adults: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects trial.  This controlled, crossover trial showed that a single, 800-mg dose of wild green oat extract temporarily improved mental performance in healthy adults, aged 40 to 65 years.   7. Digestion and Gut Health  Moderately Fermentable Potato Fiber Attenuates Signs and Inflammation Associated with Experimental Colitis in Mice.  This study in mice with colitis suggests that potato fiber may reduce intestinal inflammation, possibly by promoting the formation of short-chain fatty acids.   Casein Compared with Whey Proteins Affects the Organization of Dietary Fat during Digestion and Attenuates the Postprandial Triglyceride Response to a Mixed High-Fat Meal in Healthy, Overweight Men.  This small, crossover trial in overweight men showed that casein, the most abundant type of milk protein, affects fat digestion and reduces the rise in circulating triglycerides after a meal.   Effect of bread gluten content on gastrointestinal function: a crossover MRI study on healthy humans.  In this randomized crossover study, bread with gluten and bread without gluten had similar effects on digestive function.   Gut Microbiota Orchestrates Energy Homeostasis during Cold.  This mouse study indicates that cold exposure may change the composition of gut bacteria. The authors called the resulting microbiota the “cold microbiota.”  Transplanting the cold microbiota into other mice resulted in changes associated with adaptation to cold environments. This study shows that the gut bacteria play an important role in how animals adapt to their environment.   Oatmeal porridge: impact on microflora-associated characteristics in healthy subjects.  This study examined the effects of eating oatmeal porridge, 60 grams daily for a week, on the activity of gut bacteria.  The results suggest that oatmeal porridge may have prebiotic properties, possibly stimulating the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.   8. Bone Health  Zinc Supplementation Increases Procollagen Type 1 Amino-Terminal Propeptide in Premenarcheal Girls: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  This randomized controlled trial in 9–11 year old girls showed that taking zinc supplements, 9 mg every day for 4 weeks, increased bone formation. However, it is unclear whether this results in improved bone strength.   The effects of different levels of calcium supplementation on the bone mineral status of postpartum lactating Chinese women: a 12-month randomised, double-blinded, controlled trial.  This was a randomized trial in lactating Chinese women. The study showed that taking 300 or 600 mg of calcium for 12 months did not have any effects on bone density.   Association of dietary and serum vitamin E with bone mineral density in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults: a cross-sectional study.  This observational study in Chinese adults showed that high circulating levels of vitamin E were associated with higher bone density in women, but not in men.   9. Eyes and Vision  Human Milk Feeding as a Protective Factor for Retinopathy of Prematurity: A Meta-analysis.  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease that affects the retinas of premature children. It may result in impaired vision or blindness. This meta-analysis of observational studies concludes that breastfeeding may help prevent ROP.   10. Infant Health  Role of selected amino acids on plasma IGF-I concentration in infants.   Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is a hormone that promotes growth in children. Previous studies have shown that a high protein intake may increase circulating IGF-1 levels.  This study in infants indicates that a high-protein diet alone is not sufficient to raise IGF-1 levels. Instead, specific amino acids, such as free tryptophan and phenylalanine, are more important.   11. Inflammation  Consumption of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 in yogurt reduced expression of TLR-2 on peripheral blood-derived monocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in young adults.   This randomized crossover study indicates that the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 may reduce systemic inflammation in healthy adults.  Taking B. animalis in yogurt, especially when added before fermentation, was more effective than B. animalis in capsules.   12. Sports Nutrition  Effect of Acute Dietary Nitrate Consumption on Oxygen Consumption During Submaximal Exercise in Hypobaric Hypoxia.  This randomized, controlled crossover trial suggests that drinking beetroot juice, rich in nitrate, does not reduce oxygen uptake during exercise at a high altitude, compared to beetroot juice without nitrate.   13. Nutrients, Vitamins and Minerals  Higher visceral fat area increases the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in Chinese adults.  This cross-sectional, observational study in Chinese adults indicates that high abdominal fat may increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency.   Zinc Intake Is Associated with Lower Cadmium Burden in US Adults.  Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal. Its absorption is possibly related to zinc intake.  This observational study suggests that a high dietary intake of zinc, and high circulating levels of zinc, may promote the absorption and accumulation of cadmium in the body. However, the health relevance of this is unclear.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Eating Garlic Makes Men Smell More Attractive  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  December 2, 2015  Garlic is known for causing bad breath ( 1 , 2 ).  This is because it contains a gas called allyl methyl sulfide , which can also affect the smell of breast milk ( 3 , 4 ).  A team of researchers looked into the effects of garlic on sweat, particularly armpit odor. Here is a detailed summary of the results, recently published in Appetite .   Article Reviewed  A small team of scientists from the Czech Republic and Britain investigated the effects of garlic on men’s body odor.  Consumption of garlic positively affects hedonic perception of axillary body odour.  Basic Study Design  The purpose of the study was to test whether eating garlic would change the characteristics of men’s armpit odor, as judged by women.  The study was divided into three experiments, which included 42 men and 82 women. In each, the participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Garlic group: These men ate garlic, but the amount varied by experiment.  Control group: The men in this group ate no garlic.   Each of the three experiments tested different amounts or forms of garlic:   Experiment 1: The body odor of 10 men was rated by 14 women. The garlic group got 6 grams of crushed, raw garlic, equivalent to 2 cloves of garlic.  Experiment 2: The body odor of 16 men was rated by 40 women. The garlic group ate 12 grams of crushed, raw garlic, equivalent to 4 cloves of garlic.  Experiment 3: The body odor of 16 men was rated by 28 women. The garlic group ingested 12 garlic capsules, each containing 1 gram of garlic extract dissolved in soybean oil, an amount equivalent to 12 grams of fresh garlic.   The experiments had a crossover design. This means that all of the men were in both control and garlic groups on different occasions, separated by one week.  To collect body odor, the male participants wore cotton pads in their armpits for 12 hours while fasting, immediately after eating the experimental meal.  Afterwards, the women sniffed the pads. They then ranked the odor for its intensity, attractiveness, pleasantness and masculinity, using a 7-point scale.  Bottom Line: This study examined the effects of garlic on the characteristics of men’s armpit odor, as rated by a group of women.  Finding 1: Garlic Improved Body Odor  In the first experiment, no significant differences were detected. However, when the amount of garlic was increased in experiments 2 and 3, the body odor of men who ate garlic was significantly less intense.  The chart below shows how eating garlic affected the intensity of body odor.   Why this happens is unclear. However, there is one plausible explanation. Fresh sweat produced in the armpits is virtually odorless, but after a while it starts to smell because of the action of skin bacteria ( 5 , 6 ).  Garlic is well-known for having potent antibacterial effects. It is possible that these antibiotics may find their way into sweat, reducing the activity or growth of the skin bacteria that cause unpleasant sweat odors ( 7 ).  For this reason, the findings of the study may not have been sex-specific, and might have provided similar results if men had ranked the body odor of women.  Bottom Line: After eating garlic, the armpit odor of men was less strong or intense. Hypothetically, garlic’s antibiotic effects might reduce the growth of skin bacteria responsible for strong body odors.  Finding 2: Garlic Decreased Masculinity  Experiments 2 and 3 found that the body odor of men who ate garlic was less masculine, compared to those who didn’t eat garlic. However, eating small amounts of garlic (experiment 1) had no statistically significant effect.  The chart below shows the effects of garlic on masculinity, in all three experiments.   This may be because women find strong or intense body odors as more masculine.  If the intensity of odor was rated as high, the masculinity rating of an odor tended to be high as well.  Bottom Line: The body odor of men who ate garlic was judged as less masculine. This is probably because the sweat of men who ate garlic also smelled less strong.  Finding 3: Garlic Increased Attractiveness  In the first experiment, no statistically significant differences were detected. Experiments 2 and 3, which used twice as much garlic, showed significant differences between groups.  The armpit odor of those who ate garlic was judged as more pleasant and attractive, compared to the odor of men who didn’t eat any garlic.  The chart below shows the differences between groups in all three experiments.   This finding may be explained by the association of odor attractiveness and intensity. More intense body odors were ranked as less attractive.  Alternatively, the women might have subconsciously perceived the body odor of garlic-eating men as more attractive because it exhibited subtle signs of health.  In our opinion, however, this is a much less likely explanation.  Bottom Line: The armpit odor of men who ate garlic was rated more attractive, compared to the odor of those who didn’t eat garlic. This is presumably because garlic reduced the intensity of sweat odors.  Limitations  This study appears to have been conducted well, but has one limitation.  The number of participants was lower in experiment 1, which weakens the statistical power of the findings and makes comparisons between experiments difficult.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study suggests that eating garlic improves armpit body odor, at least in men.  Garlic decreased odor intensity and increased attractiveness, as rated by women. However, it also decreased the perception of masculinity.  Although the real-life application of this study is questionable, the results are intriguing. Garlic may affect certain skin bacteria responsible for intense sweat odor.  Clearly, there is more to garlic than meets the mouth.  Tags: Body odor , Garlic , Men's health
https://authoritynutrition.com/research/individual-factors-and-blood-sugar/
	Blood Sugar Levels After a Meal Depend on the Individual  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 30, 2015  It has long been known that foods affect blood sugar levels differently.  However, individual factors may also play a role. People respond differently to foods, even when eating the exact same thing ( 1 , 2 ).  For this reason, a team of scientists studied these individual factors. Then, they developed an algorithm to predict blood sugar responses to meals.  Here is a summary of their findings, recently published in Cell .   Background  High blood sugar levels after meals are linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. For this reason, it is very important to keep these levels within healthy limits ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).  Typically, the carb content of meals or foods is used to determine blood sugar levels, or glycemic response . However, this is a poor method ( 6 , 7 ).  Other measures of blood sugar response include the glycemic index and the glycemic load. Yet they are based on average glycemic values for single foods, so it is difficult to assess the blood sugar response of mixed meals ( 9 ).  Additionally, the blood sugar response often varies between individuals. This calls for a more personalized approach to predicting blood sugar responses.  Study Reviewed  A team of researchers from Israel set out to explain the differences in blood sugar responses between individuals. They also developed an algorithm for predicting individual blood sugar responses.  Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.  Basic Study Design  Stage I  Stage I examined the factors causing the individual variability in blood sugar responses.  The researchers monitored blood sugar levels in 800 pre-diabetic, but otherwise healthy, individuals, aged 18â70 years. Each participant was connected to a blood sugar monitor for a week, and their levels were measured every five minutes.  The researchers tested the blood sugar response to three standardized meals, given twice to each participant.  Otherwise, the participants went about their daily routines during the study period. They self-reported all of their activities, food intake, exercise and sleep.  The researchers also measured various blood values, body weight, physical activity and the levels of various types of gut bacteria.  At the end of the study, the researchers added their data to a computer program that predicted personalized blood sugar responses to meals. The accuracy of this algorithm was then tested in a group of 100 people.  Bottom Line: This large study was divided into two stages. First, the researchers monitored blood sugar levels in 800 individuals for a week to assess factors responsible for individual variability in blood sugar responses.  Stage II  The second part of the study was a randomized controlled trial with 26 participants.  It examined whether personalized nutrition, based on the prediction algorithm, could improve blood sugar responses after meals.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Prediction diet: For two weeks, participants received a personalized diet, based on the prediction algorithm.   Prescribed diet: For two weeks, the participants received a personalized diet, planned by a health professional.   In both groups, the participants followed a diet predicted to cause low blood sugar levels after meals for one week. The other week, participants followed a diet that was predicted to cause high blood sugar levels after meals.  As in the previous study, the participants were continuously connected to blood sugar monitors, and the researchers collected the same information as before.  Bottom Line: This randomized controlled trial compared the glycemic effects of a diet based on a prediction algorithm to a diet planned by a health professional.  Finding 1: Blood Sugar Response is Individual  The study showed that the blood sugar response is highly variable between individuals, even when they consume identical meals.  For example, the average blood sugar response to a standardized meal containing bread was 44 mg/dl per hour.  However, 10% of the participants had average values less than 15 mg/dl per hour, and another 10% had average values above 79 mg/dl per hour.  This individual variability in blood sugar response is well known. It may be explained by several factors, including genetics, lifestyle habits, insulin sensitivity, and the activity of digestive enzymes and glucose transporters ( 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Bottom Line: The blood sugar response to meals or single foods is highly variable between individuals.  Finding 2: Factors Predict Blood Sugar Response  Several factors predicted higher blood sugar responses after a meal:   High carb content of meal.  High amounts of dietary fiber in the meal.  High sodium content of meal.  High blood cholesterol levels.  High levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in blood.  Time since sleeping.  Old age.   Others were linked with lower blood sugar levels:   High fiber consumption in the previous 24 hours.  High fat content of meal.  High water content of meal.  High alcohol content of meal.   Bottom Line: Multiple factors affect blood sugar response after meals. These include meal factors, individual health measures, age and time since sleeping.  Finding 3: Gut Bacteria Affect Blood Sugar Response  Several types of gut bacteria were linked to higher blood sugar levels after meals.  Notably, these included the species Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron . High numbers of these bacteria may be a risk factor for obesity ( 12 , 13 ).  However, other bacteria may help with blood sugar control. The most beneficial species appeared to be Eubacterium rectale .  This is supported by previous studies showing that Eubacterium rectale may ferment dietary carbs and improve blood sugar responses after meals. It has also been linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes ( 14 , 15 , 16 ).  Bottom Line: The study indicates that gut bacteria may be responsible for some of the individual variability in blood sugar responses. This is consistent with previous studies.  Finding 4: Dietary Sugars Affect Gut Bacteria  During the randomized controlled trial, the levels of certain gut bacteria changed.  Although many of these changes were individual, the numbers of certain species of bacteria changed consistently in most of the participants.  For example, during the low-glycemic diet, the levels of Bifidobacterium adolescentis decreased. Conversely, they increased on the high-glycemic diet. Previous studies indicate that low levels of B. adolescentis may lead to greater weight loss ( 17 ).  Roseburia inulinivorans , Eubacterium eligens and Bacteroides vulgatus also increased during the low-glycemic diet and decreased on the high-glycemic diet.  Low levels of these bacteria have been linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes ( 12 , 16 , 18 ).  Bottom Line: The study showed that increasing or reducing dietary sugars may have considerable effects on the growth of gut bacteria, determining which species decrease or increase in numbers.  Finding 5: Personalized Nutrition Improves Blood Sugar Response  Using the data from Stage I, the researchers developed an algorithm to predict individual blood sugar responses to meals.  It turned out to be an effective tool for predicting blood sugar responses, even in a separate group of 100 participants.  The final part of the study was a randomized controlled trial, based on the algorithm. The researchers found that personalized nutrition effectively lowered blood sugar responses after meals.  These results were compared to a control diet prescribed by a health professional, and the prediction diet turned out to be just as effective, or even more effective.  Bottom Line: A personalized diet, predicted by an algorithm, effectively lowered blood sugar levels after meals. It was even slightly better than a diet prescribed by a health professional.  Limitations  The study appears to have been designed and executed well.  Its main limitation is that the study of personalized diets was very small, including only 26 participants.  The study was also very short, and the results cannot be generalized to longer periods.  Bottom Line: The main limitations of this study are the small size of the randomized controlled trial and its short duration.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study shows that individual factors affect how our blood sugar levels respond to food.  Although following dietary recommendations can be important, they may not always be helpful.  Instead, a diet specifically tailored to the individual seems to be the best option.  Personalized nutrition will likely become a much more prominent tool in the future.  Tags: Blood sugar , Diabetes , Personalized nutrition

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Nov 20th–Nov 27th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 27, 2015  This is an overview of interesting nutrition research published from Friday, Nov 20th, to Friday, Nov 27th.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two articles: one from Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology , and one published in JAMA .   Review : Low-Fat vs. Higher Fat Diets: Whatâs Best for Weight Loss?  Study : Effect of low-fat diet interventions versus other diet interventions on long-term weight change in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Summary : This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness of low-fat diets on weight loss. It also compared low-fat diets with low-carb and other, higher-fat diets.  The main finding was that low-fat diets may be effective for weight loss. However, they are not as effective as low-carb diets or other, higher-fat diets.   Review : Are Energy Drinks Bad for Your Heart?  Study : A Randomized Trial of Cardiovascular Responses to Energy Drink Consumption in Healthy Adults.  Summary : This randomized, controlled crossover study examined the effects of an energy drink on heart function, blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar.  The study showed that the energy drink caused a sudden increase in blood pressure and a greater rise in the stress hormone norepinephrine, compared to a placebo. The authors concluded that these changes might increase the risk of heart disease.   New Research From Around the World  Lots of new research was published this week. Below is a selection of the most interesting papers, categorized by subject.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Heart and Vascular Health  Cancer  Appetite and Eating  Mental Health  Digestive Health  Liver and Kidney Health  Infections  Sports Nutrition   1. Obesity and Weight Loss  High respiratory quotient is associated with increases in body weight and fat mass in young adults.  Respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio of carbon dioxide formation to oxygen absorption in cells. This experiment showed that a high RQ predicted body fat and weight gain for 1 year, in young adults.   Chronic insufficient sleep and diet quality: Contributors to childhood obesity.  This observational study indicates that good sleep and a high-quality diet may reduce the risk of obesity in children.   A novel gastrointestinal microbiome modulator from soy pods reduces absorption of dietary fat in mice.  This mouse experiment investigated how fiber supplements affect a high-calorie diet. It found that taking soy pod fiber for 30 days prevented weight gain by decreasing fat and sugar absorption. There was also a shift in the gut microbiota.   Intermittent energy restriction and weight loss: a systematic review.  Intermittent fasting, or intermittent calorie restriction, is a dietary pattern characterized by alternating cycles of fasting and eating. This scientific review concludes that intermittent fasting is an effective weight loss strategy.   Sugar- and artificially sweetened beverages and intrahepatic fat: A randomized controlled trial.  This 12-week, randomized controlled trial found that replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with artificially-sweetened beverages decreased liver fat.  However, the dietary replacement did not cause changes in body weight, visceral fat or other aspects of metabolic health.   2. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Administration of resveratrol for 5 wk has no effect on glucagon-like peptide 1 secretion, gastric emptying, or glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial.  This was a small, randomized, controlled crossover trial in patients with type 2 diabetes.  It showed that taking resveratrol supplements, 500 mg twice daily for 5 weeks, did not improve blood glucose control and body weight, and had no effects on stomach emptying or calorie intake.   Ellagic acid in Emblica officinalis exerts anti-diabetic activity through the action on Î˛-cells of pancreas.  Amla , scientifically known as Emblica officinalis , is an herb used by alternative medicine practitioners. One of its active constituents is ellagic acid, which promotes insulin release after sugar consumption, thus increasing blood sugar control.  This animal study shows that giving rats supplements with amla and ellagic acid, 250 or 500 ml per kg of body weight, may have beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes.   Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.  This large study showed that foods do not affect blood sugar levels the same in all individuals. In fact, there was a high variability in this response, suggesting that general dietary recommendations have limited value.  Instead, personalized dietary plans appear to be much more effective.   3. Heart and Vascular Health  Dietary nitrate improves vascular function in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  This randomized, controlled trial found that drinking nitrate-rich beetroot juice, every day for 6 weeks, improved the health and function of blood vessels, compared to nitrate-depleted beetroot juice.   Weight loss therapy for clinical management of patients with some atherosclerotic diseases: a randomized clinical trial.  Previous studies indicate that fat gain and obesity may increase the chance of atherosclerosis, a disease that restricts blood flow in arteries.  This randomized controlled trial showed that weight loss may be an effective treatment for atherosclerosis.   Time-Course Analysis of Flow Mediated Dilation for the Evaluation of Endothelial Function After a High-Fat Meal in African Americans.  Flow-mediated dilation is a measure of endothelial dysfunction (ED), which causes the inner lining of blood vessels to constrict or dilate too much. ED can contribute to hypertension.  This experiment suggests that high-fat meals lead to ED in African American women.   Contribution Of Vitamin D Deficiency To The Risk Of Coronary Heart Disease In Subjects With Essential Hypertension.  Previous research indicates that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of heart disease. This observational study in people with hypertension supports this.  People who had the lowest levels of vitamin D were most likely to experience heart attacks or other serious heart disease events.   Association of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption During Early Adulthood With the Prevalence of Coronary Artery Calcium After 20 Years of Follow-Up: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study.  This observational study suggests that a high intake of fruit and vegetables in early adulthood may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis in blood vessels supplying the heart.   Association of Dietary Protein Consumption With Incident Silent Cerebral Infarcts and Stroke: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.  Previous studies on the association of protein intake and stroke have provided inconsistent results.  This observational study did not find any link between protein intake and stroke. However, it indicates that high red meat consumption may increase the risk of stroke.   Excess weight and life expectancy after acute myocardial infarction: the obesity paradox reexamined.  Heart attacks happen when blood flow to the heart is impaired. Interestingly, obese and overweight people are at a lower risk of dying after a heart attack, compared to normal-weight people. This is known as the obesity paradox.  This observational study found a similar association. Excess body fat appeared to increase life expectancy after a heart attack.   4. Cancer  Dietary patterns and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a population-based case-control study in a rural population.  This observational study in Chinese people suggests that a high intake of alcohol and processed foods may increase the chance of getting esophageal cancer. Conversely, a diet rich in fruit and vegetables reduced the risk of esophageal cancer.   Nutrient-wide association study of 57 foods/nutrients and epithelial ovarian cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study and the Netherlands Cohort Study.  This prospective observational study suggests that a high intake of saturated fat may increase the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.   Associations of red and processed meat with survival after colorectal cancer and differences according to timing of dietary assessment.  This 5-year, prospective observational study indicates that high intake of red and processed meat does not predict a higher risk of death from colorectal cancer.   Vegetable and fruit consumption and the risk of hormone receptor-defined breast cancer in the EPIC cohort.  This huge, prospective observational study suggests that high intake of vegetables may reduce the risk of breast cancer. In contrast, fruit consumption was not associated with breast cancer risk.   Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil May Reduce Breast Cancer Risk.  This observational study was a part of the PREDIMED trial. It suggests that the Mediterranean diet, supplemented with virgin olive oil, may reduce the risk of breast cancer.   Relation between Breast Cancer and High Glycemic Index or Glycemic Load: A Meta-analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that a diet with a high glycemic index or glycemic load is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.   5. Appetite and Eating  Reduced dietary intake of simple sugars alters perceived sweet taste intensity but not perceived pleasantness.  This experiment suggests that those who reduce their sugar intake may gradually experience an increased sensitivity to the sweet taste of sugar. More studies are needed to find out if this changes the preference for sweet foods.   Gut Commensal Proteins Activate Host Satiety Pathways following Nutrient-Induced Bacterial Growth.  This experiment suggests that gut bacteria, such as E. coli , may be involved in the control of satiety (fullness).   6. Mental Health  Glycemic index, glycemic load, and common psychological disorders.  The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of the extent to which foods raise blood sugar levels after eating.  This observational study suggests that foods high on the glycemic index may increase the risk of depression. Conversely, a high glycemic load reduced the risk of mental disorders and anxiety.   7. Digestive Health  Randomized study of the effect of synbiotics during neoadjuvant chemotherapy on adverse events in esophageal cancer patients.  Synbiotics are nutritional supplements that contain both probiotics and prebiotics.  This randomized, controlled trial in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy showed that taking synbiotic supplements reduced the risk of diarrhea. They also helped maintain the numbers of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells.   Dietary guidance normalizes large intestinal endocrine cell densities in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.  This study showed that reducing the intake of FODMAPs may improve symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome. This was also associated with a beneficial change in the density of the endocrine cells lining the colon.   Effect of inulin and fructo-oligosaccharide on the prevention of acute radiation enteritis in patients with gynecological cancer and impact on quality-of-life: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Radiotherapy for cancer in the abdominal region may negatively affect gut bacteria.  This randomized controlled trial in women receiving radiotherapy found that supplementation with prebiotics improved stool consistency and regularity, indicating better digestive health.   8. Liver and Kidney Health  Vitamin E Attenuates the Progression of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Caused by Partial Hepatectomy in Mice.  This mouse study indicates that vitamin E supplements may slow the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease caused by the surgical removal of part of the liver.   Isoliquiritigenin in licorice functions as a hepatic protectant by induction of antioxidant genes through extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated NF-E2-related factor-2 signaling pathway.  This test-tube experiment suggests that isoliquiritigenin , one of the active constituents of licorice, may help protect the liver against oxidative damage.   Serum Magnesium and Sudden Death in European Hemodialysis Patients.  In patients with dysfunctional kidneys, hemodialysis is a mechanical procedure that helps clean the blood and remove excess fluid.  This observational study indicates that high levels of circulating magnesium may increase the risk of sudden death in patients undergoing hemodialysis.   9. Infections  High Dietary Folate in Mice Alters Immune Response and Reduces Survival after Malarial Infection.  This mouse study showed that high circulating folate levels increased the risk of death after a malaria infection.   The Effectiveness of Lactobacillus Beverages in Controlling Infections among the Residents of an Aged Care Facility: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Trial.  This randomized controlled trial in elderly people found that supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus casei , once daily for 6 months, decreased the frequency of fever and improved digestive health.   10. Sports Nutrition  Examining the effect of Withania somnifera supplementation on muscle strength and recovery: a randomized controlled trial.  Withania somnifera is a plant, often known as ashwagandha , used in traditional herbal medicine. This randomized controlled trial in young men showed that 300 mg of ashwagandha root, twice daily for 8 weeks, increased muscle mass and strength.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Are Energy Drinks Bad for Your Heart?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 25, 2015  Energy drinks are very popular, especially among young people.  These beverages contain stimulants, such as caffeine, which are supposed to provide a physical and mental boost.  However, drinking too many energy drinks may have serious effects on heart function and other aspects of health ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Today’s study takes a look at how energy drinks affect heart health.   Study Reviewed  Researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota conducted a small study on how energy drinks affect blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar and norepinephrine levels.  A Randomized Trial of Cardiovascular Responses to Energy Drink Consumption in Healthy Adults.  Basic Study Design  This was a randomized, controlled crossover study that examined how energy drinks affect heart function. It included 25 healthy men and women, aged 26 to 31 years.  There were two study groups:   Energy drink: The participants drank 480 mL (16 fl oz) of Rockstar, a type of energy drink. It contained several stimulants: caffeine (240 mg), taurine (2000 mg), and extracts of ginseng root, milk thistle and guarana seed.   Placebo: Another day, the participants got the same amount of a placebo drink. It was similar to the energy drink, but didn’t contain any of the stimulants.   On both occasions, the participants were fasting. They also hadn’t had any energy drinks, coffee or alcohol for at least 24 hours prior to each study day. Additionally, all study drinks were finished within 5 minutes.  Since this was a crossover trial, the participants got both drinks in random order on separate days, with less than 2 weeks apart.  Before and after drinking the energy drink and the placebo, the researchers measured circulating levels of caffeine, blood sugar, norepinephrine, blood pressure and heart rate.  Blood pressure and heart rate were also measured while the participants were under 2 minutes of stress. Responses to three types of stress were measured: physical stress, mental stress and cold stress.  Bottom Line: This small, randomized, controlled crossover study examined the effects of an energy drink on blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar and norepinephrine.  Finding 1: Energy Drinks May Increase Blood Pressure  Blood pressure increased after the energy drink, whereas the placebo drink did not cause any statistically significant changes in blood pressure.  The chart below shows the changes in mean blood pressure in both groups:   After the energy drink, systolic blood pressure increased by 6.2% and diastolic blood pressure increased by 6.8%.  Although the study did not examine how long the effects on blood pressure lasted, they were probably only temporary.  Blood pressure also rose during physical, mental and cold stress, but the energy drink didn’t add to this increase.  Additionally, the energy drink did not affect heart rate, which remained normal after both drinks.  Bottom Line: Blood pressure increased significantly after the energy drink. Conversely, the placebo drink did not lead to any significant changes.  Finding 2: Norepinephrine Increased More After the Energy Drink  Also called noradrenaline, norepinephrine is a stress hormone that helps prepare the body for action.  For this reason, its levels are lowest during sleep, and highest during periods of stress and/or fear. It is one of the body’s “fight or flight” hormones.  High levels of norepinephrine have been linked with an increased risk of heart disease in predisposed individuals ( 5 , 6 ).  In the present study, levels of norepinephrine increased after both drinks.  However, the rise was significantly higher after the energy drink, compared to the placebo.  The chart below shows the differences between groups:   As with the rise in blood pressure, the rise in norepinephrine was probably just temporary. Therefore, its health relevance is unclear.  Bottom Line: Norepinephrine levels increased after both the energy drink and the placebo. However, the increase was higher after the energy drink.  Finding 3: Blood Sugar Increased Similarly in Both Groups  Both the energy drink and the placebo drink contained equal amounts of sugar. For this reason, the blood sugar levels rose similarly after both drinks, as expected.  Several previous studies have shown that caffeine may blunt the insulin response to sugar intake for those who are not regular caffeine consumers ( 7 , 8 , 9 ).  However, this does not seem to be the case here.  Many of the participants might have been regular coffee drinkers, or the statistical power of the study was simply not great enough to detect the between-groups difference as significant.  Bottom Line: The energy drink and the placebo contained the same amount of sugar, and blood sugar levels increased similarly after both drinks.  Limitations  The main limitation of this study is the small number of participants. The study may not have had enough statistical power to detect smaller between-group differences.  Another limitation is that the energy drink contained several stimulants: caffeine, taurine, guarana, milk thistle and ginseng root. This makes it impossible to isolate the effects of the individual ingredients.  This study also only examined one energy drink, which contained a mixture of commonly used stimulants like caffeine. Other brands and products may have different ingredients.  Otherwise, this study appears to have been designed and executed well.  Bottom Line: The study’s main limitation is its small size and limited statistical power.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This small study shows that energy drinks may cause a sudden rise in blood pressure and norepinephrine.  The authors concluded that over time, these factors may possibly increase the risk of heart disease ( 6 , 10 ).  However, the extent of this risk is unclear, and needs to be studied further before any solid conclusions can be reached.  At the end of the day, energy drinks should be used sparingly, if at all. In addition to possibly harmful stimulants, they also contain sugar and other unhealthy ingredients.  Plain coffee is a much healthier alternative.

	Low-Fat vs. Higher Fat Diets: What’s Best for Weight Loss?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 23, 2015  The effects of low-fat diets on weight loss have been debated for many years.  Even though a lot of researchers have studied this, the evidence is still inconclusive.  For this reason, a team of US scientists analyzed trials comparing the effectiveness of low-fat diets to other types of diets.   Background  Many studies have examined how macronutrients — carbs, fat and protein — affect weight loss, but the best ratio of the three has yet to be determined.  One common belief is that higher-fat diets cause weight gain. As a result, many weight-loss diets are low in fat.  This is mainly because fat contains more than twice as many calories as carbs and protein. So, gram for gram, replacing fat with another macronutrient should promote weight loss.  However, the evidence is inconsistent. Randomized controlled trials do not always find low-fat diets to be effective for long-term weight loss ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, comparing the effectiveness of low-fat diets with higher-fat diets for long-term weight loss.  Effect of low-fat diet interventions versus other diet interventions on long-term weight change in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Basic Study Design  This meta-analysis examined the effectiveness of low-fat diets for long-term weight loss, compared to other types of diets.  These included low-carb diets, higher fat diets or the participants’ normal diets.  The analysis included 53 trials and a total of 68,128 participants. All of the trials were long-term, lasting for more than 1 year.  However, they were not all weight-loss trials, and the low-fat diet ranged in fat content from under 10% of calories to under 30% of calories from fat.  Bottom Line: This meta-analysis assessed how low-fat diets affected weight loss, compared to low-carb diets, higher fat diets or no participants’ normal diets.  Sub-Analyses of the Main Study  Not all of the included studies provided the same results.  This inconsistency is, at least partly, explained by how the studies were designed.  For example, the present meta-analysis suggests that study intensity may have influenced the effectiveness of the investigated diets.  Study intensity depended on several factors, such as the level of support given to participants, and whether or not the diets were calorie-restricted.  For more accurate results, the researchers did a sub-analysis of studies with a similar intensity.  Bottom Line: In addition to combining the results of all studies, this meta-analysis also compared studies of similar intensity to minimize risk of bias.  Finding 1: Low-Fat Is Not Better Than Higher-Fat  The average weight loss of all the trials was 2.7 kg (6.0 lbs).  There were no significant differences in weight loss between low-fat and higher-fat diets, when all the studies were analyzed together. This is consistent with one previous meta-analysis ( 5 ).  On the other hand, the average weight loss was 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs) in the analyses of trials where the diets were also calorie-restricted.  When the study diets differed by more than 5% of total calories from fat, higher-fat diets led to significantly greater weight loss.  Also, if the change in circulating triglycerides differed by 0.06 mmol/L or more between diets, the higher-fat diet was more effective than the low-fat diet.  Simply put, when the studies were designed for weight loss, and compliance was adequate, higher-fat diets caused more weight loss than low-fat diets.  These results are not supported by a previous meta-analysis concluding that reducing total dietary fat leads to significantly greater weight loss, compared to other dietary patterns ( 6 ).  However, this previous analysis selected studies of shorter duration, excluded trials that had calorie-restricted diets, and didn’t take study intensity into account.  Bottom Line: Overall, low-fat diets are not more effective for weight loss than higher-fat diets. In fact, higher-fat diets were more effective than low-fat diets when they differed by more than 5% of calories from fat.  Finding 2: Low-Fat Is Not Better Than Low-Carb  When compared to low-carb diets, low-fat diets were found to be slightly less effective for weight loss.  This analysis found that, on average, low-carb diets caused 1.2 kg (2.5 lbs) more weight loss than low-fat diets.  These results are supported by previous meta-analyses, which estimated a 0.9â2 kg (2â4.4 lbs) greater weight loss on a low-carb diet, compared to a low-fat diet ( 7 , 8 ).  Bottom Line: Low-carb diets caused more weight loss than low-fat diets. This is also supported by previous studies.  Finding 3: Low-Fat Is Better Than Nothing  Low-fat diets were more effective for weight loss than no dietary intervention at all.  The analysis found that people on a low-fat diet lost 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs) more weight, on average, than those who did not alter their diet.  This indicates that low-fat diets are not completely useless for weight loss. Going on a low-fat diet is definitely a better weight loss strategy than continuing to eat a Western diet.  However, higher-fat and low-carb diets are even more effective.  These results are supported by one previous meta-analysis showing that low-fat diets caused greater long-term weight loss, compared to the participants’ regular diets ( 5 ).  Bottom Line: Low-fat diets caused significantly more weight loss than habitual diets. Although a low-fat diet is not the best option, it is much better than adhering to the typical Western way of eating.  Limitations  This meta-analysis appears to be as good as they get. The main limitation is the variability of the trials, since they differed considerably in design and intensity.  However, the researchers tried to minimize this bias by doing comparisons of similar-intensity studies.  Additionally, most of the studies allowed participants to eat on their own. Food was not provided or monitored, and the studies relied on self-reporting.  Bottom Line: This was a high-quality meta-analysis with no obvious design flaws. However, the strength of the evidence is limited by the variability and shortfalls of the included trials.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Simply put, low-fat diets are not the best option for weight loss.  However, they are better than no dietary changes at all. This study just shows that other diets, such as higher-fat and low-carb diets, are much more beneficial.  If you are considering going on a weight loss diet, then you don’t necessarily need to reduce your fat intake.  Instead, you should reduce the amount of carbs in your diet, while making your food choices healthier overall.  Tags: Low-carb diets , Low-fat diets , Weight loss

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Nov 13th–Nov 20th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 20, 2015  This is an overview of interesting nutrition studies published from Friday, Nov 13th, to Friday, Nov 20th.   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two articles: one published in PLoS One , and the other from the International Journal of Obesity .   Science of Diet Review : Everything in Moderation: Helpful or Harmful Advice?  Study : Everything in Moderation — Dietary Diversity and Quality, Central Obesity and Risk of Diabetes.  Summary : This was an observational study that examined how dietary diversity or quality is linked with the risk of weight gain and diabetes.  The study doesn’t support the idea that eating many types of food promotes better health. It suggests that people should focus on dietary quality, rather than diversity.   Science of Diet Review : Slow Down! Eating Too Fast May Cause Weight Gain.  Study : Association Between Eating Rate and Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Summary : This was a meta-analysis of observational studies examining the association between the speed of eating and obesity.  The study concluded that eating quickly may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this findings.   New Research From Around the World  Currently, we follow over 100 journals in the field of nutrition and medicine, sifting through the headlines and bringing you summaries of the most interesting papers.  As usual, we organize the week’s selection by subject.   Obesity and Weight  Diabetes and Blood Sugar Control  Heart Health  Cancer  Fitness, Diet and Sleep  Women’s Health  Brain and Mental Health  Digestive Health  Kidney Function  Inflammation and Blood  Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients    Obesity and Weight  Mediterranean and Nordic diet scores and long-term changes in body weight and waist circumference: results from a large cohort study.  This prospective observational study suggests that adhering to the Nordic diet or the Mediterranean diet, at one point, does not predict future changes in body weight or waist circumference.   Sweet taste of saccharin induces weight gain without increasing caloric intake, not related to insulin-resistance in Wistar rats.  This rat study showed that yogurt sweetened with saccharin caused greater weight gain, compared to non-sweetened yogurt. This was despite a similar calorie intake.  This finding suggests that saccharin may lead to greater weight gain, without increasing calorie intake. There were no differences in leptin, peptide YY or insulin resistance between groups. However, the results need to be confirmed in humans.   Diabetes and Blood Sugar Control  A Randomised Crossover Trial: The Effect of Inulin on Glucose Homeostasis in Subtypes of Prediabetes.  This 2-week controlled crossover trial in people with pre-diabetes indicates that taking 30 grams of inulin per day may improve insulin sensitivity, compared to an equal amount of cellulose.  Supporting previous studies, these findings suggest that fermentable carbs, such as inulin, may help treat type 2 diabetes.   A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial on probiotic soy milk and soy milk: effects on epigenetics and oxidative stress in patients with type II diabetes.  This randomized controlled trial showed that drinking 200 ml of probiotic soy milk each day, for 8 weeks, improved antioxidant status and decreased DNA methylation in type 2 diabetics. This indicates that probiotics may help treat type 2 diabetes.   Heart Health  A Systematic Review of High-Oleic Vegetable Oil Substitutions for Other Fats and Oils on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Implications for Novel High-Oleic Soybean Oils.  This scientific review concludes that replacing saturated fat or trans fat with high-oleic acid oil may benefit the blood lipid profile and reduce the risk of heart disease. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fats may have similar effects.   Impact of Nutrients and Food Components on Dyslipidemias: What Is the Evidence?  This scientific review discusses the evidence about the beneficial effects of nutrients on the blood lipid profile. These include polyphenols, plant proteins, soluble fiber, monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat.   Plant Protein and Animal Proteins: Do They Differentially Affect Cardiovascular Disease Risk?  This study indicates that a diet rich in plant protein may reduce heart disease risk, compared to a diet high in animal protein. However, this review also shows that the evidence supporting this is inconclusive.   Red Blood Cell Dysfunction Induced by High-Fat Diet: Potential Implications for Obesity-Related Atherosclerosis.  This mouse study indicates that a high-fat diet may have negative effects on red blood cells. In turn, these cells may promote the development of heart disease.   Pro-inflammatory dietary intake as a risk factor for CVD in men: a 5-year longitudinal study.  Previous studies have shown that inflammation contributes to atherosclerosis . This observational study indicates that a pro-inflammatory diet may raise the risk of atherosclerosis, compared to an anti-inflammatory diet.   Cardiovascular Responses to Energy Drink Consumption in Adults.  This small randomized trial compared the health effects of an energy drink and a placebo drink. The energy drink contained caffeine, taurine, and extracts of guarana seed, milk thistle and ginseng root.  After drinking the energy drink, blood pressure increased temporarily by an average of 6.4%. The authors suggested that these changes may promote an increased risk of heart disease.   Mediterranean diet score and total and cardiovascular mortality in Eastern Europe: the HAPIEE study.  This observational study suggests that adhering to the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of heart disease in Eastern European populations.   Cancer  Potential for Dietary ω-3 Fatty Acids to Prevent Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Reduce the Risk of Primary Liver Cancer.  This scientific review concludes that consuming docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is an essential omega-3 fatty acid, may be useful in preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This, in turn, may reduce the risk of liver cancer.   Vitamins in Pancreatic Cancer: A Review of Underlying Mechanisms and Future Applications.  This scientific review suggests that vitamins A, C, D, E and K may help treat pancreatic cancer. However, this needs to be confirmed in clinical trials before any strong conclusions can be made.   The favourable effects of long-term selenium supplementation on regression of cervical tissues and metabolic profiles of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is the abnormal growth of cells on the surface of the cervix. A small amount of cases may turn into cervical cancer, if left untreated.  This randomized controlled trial found that selenium supplements — 200 mcg daily for 6 months — may help treat this condition.   Increased dietary levels of α-linoleic acid inhibit mammary tumor growth and metastasis.  This mouse study suggests that alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) may help prevent breast cancer.   Isoflavone and Soyfood Intake and Colorectal Cancer Risk: A Case-Control Study in Korea.  This observational study indicates that a high intake of soy foods, or dietary isoflavones, may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer — especially rectal cancer.   Green tea consumption and glutathione S-transferases genetic polymorphisms on the risk of adult leukemia.  Leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in bone marrow, causing abnormal numbers of white blood cells. This observational study in Chinese adults suggests that drinking green tea every day may reduce the risk of leukemia.   Fitness, Diet and Sleep  The Effects of Pre-Exercise Caffeinated-Coffee Ingestion on Endurance Performance: An Evidence-Based Review.  This review concludes that coffee, containing 3 to 8.1 mg/kg of caffeine, may temporarily help improve endurance performance.   Vegetarian and Omnivorous Nutrition – Comparing Physical Performance.  This systematic review discusses the results of 7 randomized controlled trials, and one observational study, comparing the effects of vegetarian and omnivorous diets on physical performance.  It concludes that vegetarian diets did not improve or worsen physical performance in athletes, compared to omnivorous diets.   Health and dietary traits of organic food consumers: results from the NutriNet-Santé study.  This observational study showed that organic food consumers in France were more likely to be vegetarian.  Organic food consumers had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, but this only applied to men. Conversely, organic food consumers were more likely to report food allergies.   The effects of moderate energy restriction on apnoea severity and CVD risk factors in obese patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.  Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition that is associated with snoring, pauses in breathing and sleep disturbances, leading to daytime fatigue.  This 16-week randomized trial shows that moderate calorie restriction may reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea.   Women’s Health  Western dietary pattern is related to premenstrual syndrome: a case–control study.  Premenstrual syndrome may occur one or two weeks before women have their period. The symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, headache, emotional sensitivity and mood swings.  This observational study suggests that the Western dietary pattern may increase the risk of premenstrual syndrome.   Are Dieting and Dietary Inadequacy a Second Hit in the Association with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Severity?  Polycystic ovary syndrome is a group of adverse symptoms caused by a hormonal imbalance in women. The symptoms may include irregular or no periods, acne and excess body hair.  This observational study indicates that going on a diet, especially a diet that is nutritionally inadequate, may increase the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.   Early pregnancy vitamin D status and risk for adverse maternal and infant outcomes in a bi-ethnic cohort: the Behaviors Affecting Baby and You (B.A.B.Y.) Study.  This observational study suggests that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may decrease the birth weight of the child. Additionally, women who were vitamin D deficient were more likely to become diabetic during pregnancy.   Maternal obesity and gestational weight gain are risk factors for infant death.  This observational study indicates that high body mass index before pregnancy, and high weight gain during pregnancy, may increase the risk of infant death. However, very low weight gain during pregnancy was also a risk factor.   Influence of obesity on vertebral fracture prevalence and vitamin D status in postmenopausal women.  This observational study found that obese, postmenopausal women had a higher bone mineral density and a lower risk of osteoporosis, compared to lean women.  The risk of fractures was significantly associated with higher age, lower body weight, lower bone mineral density and vitamin D deficiency.   Brain and Mental Health  Consumption of garlic positively affects hedonic perception of axillary body odour.  This experimental study indicates that women are more attracted to the body odor of men who have recently eaten garlic, compared to those who haven’t.   Individual differences in bitter taste preferences are associated with antisocial personality traits.  This study suggests that those who generally like bitter-tasting foods and drinks are more likely to have antisocial personality traits.   Digestive Health  Efficacy and safety of a natural mineral water rich in magnesium and sulphate for bowel function: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.  This randomized controlled trial showed that drinking natural mineral water, rich in magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate, reduced constipation and improved regularity, compared to a placebo.   Kidney Function  Probiotics and chronic kidney disease.  This review discusses the potential of using probiotics in the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Test-tube experiments and animal studies have provided some promising evidence, but clinical trials are still lacking.   Excess 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 exacerbates tubulointerstitial injury in mice by modulating macrophage phenotype.  This mouse study indicates that too much vitamin D may have adverse effects on kidney function.   Inflammation and Blood  Effect of Nutritional Status and Dietary Patterns on Human Serum C-Reactive Protein and Interleukin-6 Concentrations.  C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are inflammatory markers involved in the development of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.  This scientific review discusses the association of CRP and IL-6 and dietary factors. The Mediterranean diet appears to be very effective against inflammation. The DASH diet and vegetarian diets may also be beneficial.   Dietary isoflavone intake is associated with a reduced risk of myelodysplastic syndromes.  Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of diseases that adversely affect the production of blood cells in bone marrow.  This observational study in Chinese adults suggests that a high intake of isoflavones, which are found in high amounts in soy foods, may reduce the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome.   Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients  Dietary intake and food sources of choline in European populations.  This study estimated the dietary intake of choline in Europe and identified its main dietary sources. The average daily intake of choline in adults was 291–468 mg. The main dietary sources of choline were meat, milk, grains, eggs and fish.   Increase in Adipose Tissue Linoleic Acid of US Adults in the Last Half Century.  This study in US adults indicates that linoleic acid (LA) in fat tissue has increased by 136%, on average, during the last half century. This is linked to an increase in dietary LA, but the health implications are unclear.   Tags: Weekly recap

	Slow Down! Eating Too Fast May Cause Weight Gain  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 18, 2015  Eating too fast has often been linked to weight gain, yet the available evidence is inconclusive.  For this reason, a team of Japanese researchers conducted a meta-analysis that combined the results of several previous studies.  Here is a detailed summary of their findings, recently published in the International Journal of Obesity .   Background  How eating behavior affects weight gain and obesity is an area of active research. One interesting part of this is eating rate, or the speed of eating.  Because eating speed is so important, slow and thoughtful eating is often recommended as an effective weight loss strategy ( 1 ).  This is supported by several observational studies, suggesting that eating slowly may reduce the risk of obesity ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ).  However, the available evidence is not entirely conclusive ( 6 , 7 ).  Article Reviewed  A team of Japanese scientists conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies about the association of eating speed with obesity.  Association between eating rate and obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Basic Study Design  This meta-analysis included data from 23 observational studies that investigated the link between eating speed and obesity.  Using the combined dataset, the researchers tried to answer the following two questions:   Is eating speed associated with body mass index (BMI) or obesity?   Is eating speed associated with weight gain?   In this study, “eating speed” refers to how quickly people finished a meal.  Bottom Line: This was a meta-analysis, combining the results of 23 observational studies. It examined the association between eating speed and weight gain or obesity.  Finding 1: Fast Eaters Are Much More Likely to Be Obese  The study showed that fast eaters tend to have a higher average BMI. They are also more likely to be obese, compared to those that eat slower.  The results can be seen in the plot below, which shows the obesity risk in relation to eating speed.   As you can see in the plot above, obesity is very strongly linked to eating quickly.  This association was weaker in diabetics, but was otherwise consistent across subgroups.  Bottom Line: This study shows that people who eat more quickly tend to have higher BMIs and obesity rates, compared to people with less fat mass.  Finding 2: Fast Eating is Linked to Weight Gain  The analysis included three studies examining the association of eating rate and weight gain or the risk of developing obesity.  One study in firefighters showed that those who ate quickly at the station gained 9.9 lbs (4.5 kg) over a 7-year period, compared to only 6.8 lbs (3.0 kg) among those who ate slowly ( 8 ).  The second observational study found that those who ate quickly gained 2.4 lbs (1.1 kg) more weight over an 8 year period, compared to those who ate more slowly ( 9 ).  Finally, the third study showed that university students who finished their meals quickly were at an increased risk of becoming obese ( 10 ).  Bottom Line: Overall, this meta-analysis suggests that eating quickly increases the risk of weight gain and obesity.  How Does Rate of Eating Affect Weight?  Other studies have proposed several possible explanations for the link between eating rate and obesity.  These include:   Greater calorie intake: Several observational studies and one meta-analysis indicate that a fast eating pace may lead to a higher calorie intake ( 11 , 12 , 13 ).   Eating ahead of brain signals: Fast eaters consume more calories before the satiety (appetite-reducing) signals kick in ( 14 ).   Lower levels of satiety hormones: One study has shown that eating a meal quickly causes lower levels of satiety hormones, such as peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( 15 ).   However, the present study does not support the above-mentioned theories. In this analysis, calorie intake turned out to be similar across different eating rates.  Instead, the authors suggested an alternative explanation.  Fast eaters may chew their food less than slow eaters. A lack of chewing may inactivate histamine, which is a type of neurotransmitter. This, in turn, may reduce fat burning ( 16 ).  Bottom Line: Several factors may explain how the speed at which you eat affects weight gain. The authors suggested that faster eating is linked to a reduction in fat burning.  Limitations  The study seems to have been well executed, but a few important limitations should be mentioned.  First off, this meta-analysis included only observational studies, which cannot prove a causal relationship. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish causality.  Second, in all of the included studies, save one, eating speed was assessed from self-reports. This may have caused some inaccuracies.  Third, many of the included studies categorized eating rates differently.  Finally, most of the participants were Japanese. This limits the generalization of the results to other populations, who may have different dietary habits.  Bottom Line: The study included results from observational studies, which can’t demonstrate causality. Additionally, the participants were mostly Japanese and the results may not be generalized to all populations.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This meta-analysis clearly suggests that the speed of eating affects weight.  Faster eaters have higher BMIs and are much more likely to be obese. People who eat quickly also gain much more weight when followed for several years.  One study suggests that retraining eating behavior, by reducing portions and slowing down the speed of eating, can lead to significant weight loss ( 17 ).  However, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings, which for now are only observational in nature.  Meanwhile, eating slowly and without distraction is definitely very sensible advice.  Tags: Obesity , Weight gain

	Everything in Moderation: Helpful or Harmful Advice?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 16, 2015  Most dietary guidelines recommend dietary diversity.  In other words, they say that people should eat lots of different kinds of food in moderation. “Everything in moderation” is a popular phrase.  However, it is unclear whether following this recommendation has any effects on people’s health.  A group of scientists tried to answer this question by examining the association of dietary diversity and abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes.   Background  Dietary diversity has never been clearly defined.  Most previous studies simply define it as the number of different foods you eat in a certain time frame.  However, this leaves out some important factors, such as how the foods are spaced out or how different the foods actually are.  A few previous studies have investigated the effects of a diverse diet, but most focused only on diversity within selected food groups.  For example, one observational study links eating many different types of fruits and vegetables to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes ( 1 ).  Another observational study showed that eating a variety of vegetables may help prevent weight gain. However, eating many varieties of unhealthy foods may increase the risk of weight gain ( 2 ).  These studies suggest that dietary diversity can affect health in different ways, depending on what foods are eaten.  Article Reviewed  A team of researchers from the US examined how a varied diet affects the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes.  Everything in Moderation — Dietary Diversity and Quality, Central Obesity and Risk of Diabetes.  Basic Study Design  This study was a secondary analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a prospective observational study in people of Caucasian, Hispanic, African and Chinese descent.  The purpose of this secondary analysis was to examine the association of dietary quality with abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes.  A total of 2505 men and women, 45 to 84 years old, participated. None of them had type 2 diabetes. At the beginning of the study, their diet was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire.  To estimate dietary diversity, the researchers assessed:   Count : How many different foods were eaten more than once per week.   Evenness : How the diversity was spread out over the week.   Dissimilarity : How different the foods were.   After 5–7 years, the study staff measured body weight and waist circumference. Fasting blood sugar was measured 10–11 years later.  Bottom Line: This was a prospective observational study examining how the risk of weight gain and diabetes is linked with dietary diversity or quality.  Finding 1: Dietary Diversity Is Not Associated With Dietary Quality  The major finding of the study is that a diverse diet is not necessarily a healthy diet.  The count and evenness measures of dietary diversity were only weakly linked with dietary quality.  Conversely, greater food dissimilarity was linked with lower dietary quality — a lower intake of healthy foods and a higher intake of unhealthy foods.  Bottom Line: A diverse diet is not necessarily a healthy diet. Eating many different types of food doesn’t guarantee that those foods are high in quality.  Finding 2: Dietary Diversity May Promote Weight Gain  Greater food dissimilarity was linked with higher gain in waist circumference, which is a measure of belly fat.  This is probably because a higher food dissimilarity was associated with a higher intake of unhealthy food.  Supporting this, one observational study showed that greater dietary variation was associated with a higher intake of unhealthy foods ( 3 ).  Additionally, observational studies suggest that high dietary diversity may lead to increased calorie intake and fat gain ( 2 , 3 , 4 ).  Bottom Line: Eating many different kinds of food does not necessarily prevent belly fat. In fact, increasing diversity may even promote higher calorie intake and weight gain.  Finding 3: A Varied Diet Was Not Linked With Type 2 Diabetes  During the 10-year follow-up period, 24% of the participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  However, this was not linked to dietary diversity. Likewise, no significant associations were found when foods were categorized as either healthy or unhealthy.  In fact, a greater variety in fruit and vegetable intake did not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.  This is inconsistent with one observational study suggesting that eating a greater variety of fruits and vegetables may help prevent type 2 diabetes ( 1 ).  On the other hand, the present study found high dietary quality to be significantly associated with less risk of type 2 diabetes.  This means that diets should focus on high-quality food, rather than on diversity.  Bottom Line: A diverse diet did not protect against type 2 diabetes. However, a high-quality diet was linked with less risk of type 2 diabetes.  Limitations  The use of food frequency questionnaires to assess dietary variation is one of the main limitations of the study.  Food frequency questionnaires can only include a few types of food. For example, the fruit and vegetable category included only 23 different foods.  For this reason, dietary diversity may have been biased or underestimated.  Additionally, this was an observational study, not a controlled trial. Although the study was designed well, it can not prove causation.  For example, it can show that people who eat a diverse diet have a higher risk of weight gain, but it can not prove that the diverse diet itself caused the weight gain.  Bottom Line: The study was designed well. However, the use of food frequency questionnaires to assess dietary intake limited the researchers’ ability to fully evaluate dietary diversity.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study does not support the idea that eating whatever you want, even in moderation, promotes a healthier diet.  However, this doesn’t mean dietary diversity is a bad thing.  For example, in developing countries with limited food supplies, greater dietary diversity would increase nutrient intake ( 5 ).  It just means that, for many people, diet should focus on eating quality, whole foods — but not trying to eat “everything in moderation.”  Tags: Diabetes , Healthy eating , Obesity

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Nov 6th–Nov 13th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 13, 2015  This is an overview of interesting studies published on nutrition from Friday, Nov 6th, to Friday, Nov 13th.   Research Reviews  We reviewed two articles this week: a research summary, published in The Lancet Oncology , and a research paper, from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .  Monday  Link : Do Red Meat and Processed Meat Really Cause Cancer?  Study : Carcinogenicity of consumption of red and processed meat.  Summary : The International Agency for Research on Cancer released a research summary on the effects of red meat and processed meat on cancer risk. The full results will be published in the IARC Monographs at a later date.  According to the paper, there is sufficient evidence linking a high intake of processed meat with an increased risk of colon cancer. Conversely, there is limited evidence that red meat causes cancer.  Wednesday  Link : Water vs Diet Soda: Which is Better for Weight Loss?  Study : Effects on weight loss in adults of replacing diet beverages with water during a hypoenergetic diet: a randomized, 24-wk clinical trial.  Summary : This randomized weight loss trial compared the effectiveness of diet soda and water in obese and overweight women.  The main finding was that drinking pure water promotes significantly greater weight loss, compared to diet soda. However, other studies have shown different results.  New Research From Around the World  Lots of new research was published this week. Some of the papers may be more than a week old, as we are constantly updating the list of journals we follow.  Below is a selection of the most interesting papers, organized by subject.  Obesity and Weight Loss  Association between eating rate and obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis combined the results of 23 observational studies examining whether eating food quickly is associated with obesity.  Not surprisingly, eating quickly turned out to be associated with excess body weight. These results support the idea that mindful eating may help with weight loss.   Caffeine intake is related to successful weight loss maintenance.   This observational study suggests that drinking caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, may help people maintain a healthy weight.   Cluster analysis of behavioural weight management strategies and associations with weight change in young women: a longitudinal analysis.  This cluster analysis roughly categorized the different weight loss strategies used by the 8,125 women in the the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women’s Health.  The most common weight loss strategies turned out to be dieting, eating less and exercising. Healthy eating and exercising were the most effective methods.   Effect of adipose tissue volume loss on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: results from a 1-year lifestyle intervention in viscerally obese men.  This 1-year, weight-loss trial in men with central obesity showed that circulating vitamin D levels increased gradually with weight loss.  In fact, vitamin D levels increased by 26%, while visceral fat decreased by the same percentage.   Prebiotic consumption and the incidence of overweight in a Mediterranean cohort: the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra Project.  Prebiotics are dietary substances, such as fiber and non-digestible carbs, that feed the beneficial bacteria in our digestive system. Scientists have suggested that consuming prebiotics may protect against weight gain or obesity.  This prospective, observational study in middle-aged, normal-weight adults found that those who consumed high amounts of prebiotics, such as fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides, were less likely to be overweight.   In overweight and obese women, dietary iron absorption is reduced and the enhancement of iron absorption by ascorbic acid is one-half that in normal-weight women.  Iron deficiency is a common problem in both overweight and obese individuals. This study found that iron absorption in obese women was only two-thirds of that in normal-weight women.  Additionally, the effect of vitamin C, which is a common enhancer of iron absorption, was only one-half of that in normal-weight women. The authors suggested that inflammation in the digestive system may be responsible.   Low levels of physical activity are associated with dysregulation of energy intake and fat mass gain over 1 year.  Lack of physical activity is a well-known risk factor for obesity. This clinical trial supports previous studies, suggesting that sedentary lifestyles cause an imbalance in calorie intake and calories burned.   Appetite and Calorie Intake  No difference in ad libitum energy intake in healthy men and women consuming beverages sweetened with fructose, glucose, or high-fructose corn syrup: a randomized trial.  This randomized controlled trial in healthy adults found that calorie intake was higher in those who consumed sugar-sweetened beverages, compared with aspartame-sweetened beverages.  They also found that the type of sugar did not matter. Drinking beverages sweetened with fructose, glucose or high-fructose corn syrup affected calorie intake similarly.   Metabolic Syndrome  Vitamin D deficiency in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: The chicken or the egg?  Circulating vitamin D levels are often low in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  This weight-loss trial in patients with NAFLD found that weight loss increased vitamin D levels, even without vitamin D supplementation. Additionally, liver fat, liver enzymes and metabolic health improved.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Carbohydrate quality and quantity and risk of type 2 diabetes in US women.  This large, prospective observational study suggests that diets high in starch and low in fiber may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Similarly, a high ratio of starch to cereal fiber was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.   Zinc and Other Metals Deficiencies and Risk of Type 1 Diabetes: An Ecological Study in the High Risk Sardinia Island.  This observational study suggests that micronutrients, such as cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, nickel and zinc, may protect against type 1 diabetes.   Insulin resistance determines a differential response to changes in dietary fat modification on metabolic syndrome risk factors: the LIPGENE study.  This large, randomized controlled trial in individuals with metabolic syndrome found that those with greater insulin resistance responded differently to dietary changes to the type of fat.  For example, people with greater insulin resistance were more likely to respond negatively when switching over to a diet high in saturated fat. Similarly, they benefited more from replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats or omega-3.   Psyllium fiber improves glycemic control proportional to loss of glycemic control: a meta-analysis of data in euglycemic subjects, patients at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and patients being treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that psyllium fiber supplementation had beneficial effects on blood sugar control.  Taking psyllium fiber had greater benefits in patients who were being treated for type 2 diabetes, compared to those who were at risk for type 2 diabetes.   Metabolic response to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in patients with diabetic nephropathy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial in patients with diabetic nephropathy found that supplementation with omega-3 fat from flaxseed oil, 1000 mg per day for 12 weeks, reduced insulin levels and improved insulin sensitivity.  Additionally, omega-3 supplementation had beneficial effects on blood lipid levels. Conversely, the study didn‘t detect any improvements in inflammation or oxidative stress.   Heart Health  Vaccenic acid and trans fatty acid isomers from partially hydrogenated oil both adversely affect LDL cholesterol: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.  Vaccenic acid is the most abundant trans fat naturally found in dairy fat.  This randomized controlled trial showed that vaccenic acid is as bad for LDL-cholesterol levels as industrially produced trans fatty acids, when consumed in equal amounts.   Dietary fat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in a population at high risk of cardiovascular disease.  To reduce the risk of heart disease, improving fat quality is more important than reducing the total intake of dietary fat.  This observational study suggests that eating monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats may protect against heart disease. High intake of saturated fats and trans fatty acids was associated with an increased risk of heart disease.   Effects of tree nuts on blood lipids, apolipoproteins, and blood pressure: systematic review, meta-analysis, and dose-response of 61 controlled intervention trials.  This meta-analysis of controlled trials found that eating tree nuts may have beneficial effects on the blood lipid profile, improving the levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides.  These results indicate that consuming tree nuts on a regular basis may help prevent heart disease.   The effect of moderate alcohol consumption on biomarkers of inflammation and hemostatic factors in postmenopausal women.  This randomized crossover study in postmenopausal women found that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce inflammation.  Additionally, moderate alcohol consumption improved hemostatic factors, which are substances that mediate blood clotting and have been associated with increased heart disease risk.   Safety and efficacy of cocoa flavanol intake in healthy adults: a randomized, controlled, double-masked trial.  Previous evidence indicates that cocoa flavonoids may improve heart health. This randomized controlled trial in healthy adults suggests that taking cocoa flavonoids, 2000 mg/day for 12 weeks, is well tolerated.  Supplementing with cocoa flavonoids did not have any significant effects on blood pressure or platelet factors, compared with the control groups.   Cancer  The association of coffee intake with liver cancer risk is mediated by biomarkers of inflammation and hepatocellular injury: data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.  High coffee intake has been associated with a lower risk of liver cancer.  This observational study suggests that the protective effects of coffee may be due to its beneficial effects on inflammation and liver health.   Are strict vegetarians protected against prostate cancer?  This observational study suggests that vegan diets may lower the risk of prostate cancer.   Effects of Calcium Supplementation on Biomarkers of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Colorectal Adenoma Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  Calcium has been associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. This randomized controlled trial in patients with previous colon cancer tested two different supplementary doses of calcium, 1 g/day and 2 g/day.  The study did not reveal any protective effects of calcium supplementation. Markers for inflammation and oxidative stress were similar between groups.   Brain Function and Mental Health  Folate and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy has long-term effects on the attention system of 8.5-y-old offspring: a randomized controlled trial.  Folate is important for normal brain development. This randomized controlled trial suggests that folate supplementation during pregnancy improves cognition in the child.  Conversely, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil did not appear to have any significant effects on cognition.   Liver Health  Coffee Consumption Decreases Risks for Hepatic Fibrosis and Cirrhosis: A Meta-Analysis.   This meta-analysis of human trials shows that regular coffee consumption may reduce the risk of liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatic fibrosis.   Bone Health  Dietary acid load in early life and bone health in childhood: the Generation R Study.  Some scientists claim that acid-base balance in early life may affect bone mineral density in later life.  This prospective observational study in children does not support this idea. It suggests that dietary acid load in infancy is not associated with bone health in later childhood.   Cross-sectional and prospective associations between dietary and plasma vitamin C, heel bone ultrasound, and fracture risk in men and women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer in Norfolk cohort.  Adequate amounts of vitamin C may help prevent osteoporosis. This observational study found that higher vitamin C intake was significantly associated with greater bone mineral density in both men and women.  Additionally, circulating vitamin C levels were associated with decreased risk of fractures, but only in men.   Fertility and Pregnancy  Intake of carbohydrates during pregnancy in obese women is associated with fat mass in the newborn offspring.  This observational study indicates that if pregnant, obese women eat high amounts of carbs in late pregnancy, their children are more likely to be fat when they are born.   Short-term effects of a hypocaloric diet with low glycemic index and low glycemic load on body adiposity, metabolic variables, ghrelin, leptin, and pregnancy rate in overweight and obese infertile women: a randomized controlled trial.  This 12-week, randomized controlled trial in overweight or obese infertile women found that weight loss significantly improved fertility and increased pregnancy rate. It also reduced body mass index, body fat percentage and leptin levels.   Infant Nutrition  Neuroimaging identifies increased manganese deposition in infants receiving parenteral nutrition.Manganese is a trace element that is essential for normal growth and development. However, it is neurotoxic in high amounts.   This prospective observational study indicates that a high dietary intake of manganese in infants may cause manganese to accumulate in the brain. The health implications are unclear.   Healthy Aging  Plasma vitamin D biomarkers and leukocyte telomere length in men.   Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of DNA strands. Their lengths shorten with age. This shortening has been implicated as one of the causes of aging.  This cross-sectional observational study in men found no significant association between vitamin D levels and telomere length.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Water vs Diet Soda: Which is Better for Weight Loss?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 11, 2015  Many people think drinking diet beverages is a great way to lose weight.  However, most dietary recommendations say pure water is best. Recently, a team of scientists from Iran and the UK delved into this issue.  Here is a detailed summary of the results, recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .   Background  Sugar-sweetened beverages have long been linked to weight gain ( 1 , 2 ).  For this reason, beverages with low-calorie sweeteners have become a popular alternative for those who wish to maintain or lose weight ( 3 ).  Although the evidence is mixed, some studies actually suggest that diet beverages may be associated with weight gain as well ( 4 ).  Article Reviewed  A group of researchers from Iran and the UK compared the effectiveness of diet beverages and water on weight loss.  Effects on weight loss in adults of replacing diet beverages with water during a hypoenergetic diet: a randomized, 24-wk clinical trial.  Basic Study Design  This was a 24-week, randomized weight loss trial in 62 healthy, overweight and obese women. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 50 years.  Before the study started, all of the participants regularly consumed diet beverages.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Diet beverage group: Participants were provided with 250 ml (8.5 oz) of a diet beverage and were told to drink it after lunch, 5 times per week.   Water group: Participants in this group stopped drinking diet beverages and replaced them with equal amounts of water, provided by the study staff.   However, it is important to note that the contents of the diet beverage are not specified.  This study was designed to promote weight loss of 7â10%, during the research period. This involved a calorie-restricted diet that was high in carbs (60%), but low in fat (23%) and protein (17%).  Additionally, participants had professional support throughout the study, and were encouraged to gradually increase physical activity to 60 minutes, 5 days of the week.  The researchers measured body weight, insulin, blood sugar and blood lipids at the beginning, middle and end of the study.  Bottom Line: This was a randomized weight-loss trial in overweight and obese women. It compared the effectiveness of drinking diet beverages or replacing them with water.  Finding 1: Water is More Effective for Weight Loss  Participants in both groups achieved significant weight loss during the study.  However, drinking pure water resulted in a 13.6% greater weight loss than diet beverages.  However, the difference was small, amounting to 2.6 pounds, or 1.2 kg.  The chart below shows the difference in weight loss and body mass index (BMI) between groups.   Overall, drinking water led to greater weight loss and improvements to BMI, compared to drinking diet beverages.  Bottom Line: The study showed that drinking pure water leads to greater weight loss, compared to drinking diet beverages.  What Do Other Studies Say?  In general, these results are supported by studies showing that increased water intake can help with weight loss ( 5 ).  However, there are mixed results in studies that compared water and diet beverages. For example, one randomized controlled trial found that diet beverages caused significantly greater weight loss, compared to water ( 6 ).  Another trial found that weight loss was similar among those who drank water or diet beverages ( 7 ).  The cause of these inconsistencies is unknown, but they might be due to differences in the type of diet beverage or a lack of compliance.  Despite these disparities, the present study is significant because it is different from previous trials.  This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of replacing diet beverages with water, during a weight loss program, where participants were obese, regular drinkers of diet beverages.  Bottom Line: The study showed that replacing diet beverages with water led to greater weight loss. However, other studies have found no difference, and some have even found diet beverages to lead to more weight loss than water.  Finding 2: Water Caused Greater Improvements in Blood Sugar Control  Drinking pure water, rather than diet beverages, caused significantly greater improvements in blood sugar control.  The chart below shows the improvements in insulin and blood sugar levels 2 hours (2-hbs) after eating 75 grams of glucose.   Insulin resistance also improved significantly.  Additionally, although fasting blood sugar levels improved overall, the difference between groups was not statistically significant.  Bottom Line: Overall, the weight loss program caused significant improvements in blood sugar control. Drinking water caused greater improvements in fasting insulin and insulin resistance.  Finding 3: Water and Diet Beverages Had Similar Effects on Blood Lipids  The weight loss program caused substantial improvements in blood lipids in both groups.  The chart below shows the changes in both groups.   These improvements were not significantly different between groups.  Bottom Line: The blood lipid profile improved in both groups. However, there was no significant difference between groups. In general, this indicates that water and diet beverages may have similar effects on blood lipids.  Limitations  The study appears to have been well designed and executed.  However, the paper itself has one major limitation. It fails to provide information about the contents of the diet beverage used in the study, which makes interpreting the results difficult.  There are many different artificial sweeteners in the food supply. Different types may have different effects.  Also, according to self-reported food records, calorie intake and carb intake reduced slightly more in the water group, compared to the diet beverage group.  This may explain some of the differences between groups.  Bottom Line: The study appears to have been designed well. However, the paper fails to specify the contents of the diet beverage, which makes interpreting the results difficult.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study indicates that pure water promotes significantly greater weight loss, compared to diet beverages.  Additionally, drinking water caused greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, indicating improved metabolic health.  However, it is impossible to reach any conclusions based on this study alone, because other studies have shown completely different effects.  At the end of the day, this may depend on the individual.  If you like diet drinks, and they help you stick to a healthy diet, then there is probably no need to stop drinking them.  But if you are drinking them, and you have trouble losing weight or want to speed things up, removing these drinks may or may not help.  It’s definitely something that is worth experimenting with, but the science is not settled on this issue yet.  Tags: Diet drinks , Water , Weight loss

	Do Red Meat and Processed Meat Really Cause Cancer?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 9, 2015  Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a summary saying red and processed meat cause cancer.  The media went ablaze, with headlines such as “Processed meat ranks alongside smoking as major cause of cancer, World Health Organisation says.”  However, this is an oversimplification of the results. In this review, we will explain the WHO’s findings in more detail.   Background and Summary Reviewed  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is a department within the WHO, assessed the effects of red meat and processed meat on cancer risk.  A short summary was released in Lancet Oncology , but the full results will be disclosed in volume 114 of the IARC Monographs .  The information that was published is not new. The link between these types of meat and cancer has been known for many years, although the strength of the evidence has been a matter of debate.  The reason for the media headlines now is the source of the claims. A warning issued by the WHO should not be taken lightly.  In this article, we are going to review the IARC’s research summary, discuss the strength of the evidence and look at what that means.  Bottom Line: The IARC (a division of the WHO) released a summary recently saying red and processed meat cause cancer. It gained a lot of media coverage.  What Did the Research Summary Say?  The summary paper refers to a massive study conducted by an international group of 22 scientists.  Here are their main conclusions:   Processed red meat is carcinogenic to humans: It is categorized as a “group 1” carcinogen, which means that the evidence linking processed meat with cancer is sufficient.   Red meat is probably carcinogenic to humans: It is categorized as a “group 2A” carcinogen, which means that the evidence is limited. Red meat has not yet been established as a cancer cause.   This mainly refers to colon cancer, which is the third main cause of cancer-related death in the US ( 1 ).  Processed meat was classified as a “group 1” carcinogen, the category of highest risk. Tobacco smoking and radioactive materials are in the same group.  However, this does not mean that processed meat is as carcinogenic as nuclear waste. The IARC classifications refer to the strength of the scientific evidence, not the level of risk.  In fact, the cancer risk of eating processed meat is very small compared to the risk associated with smoking.  Bottom Line: The study concluded that processed red meat can increase the risk of colon cancer in humans, whereas unprocessed red meat is only probably carcinogenic.  How Strong is the Evidence?  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard of human research, are difficult when investigating the causes of cancer in humans.  There are two main reasons for this. First, cancer takes a very long time to develop. Second, exposing humans to something potentially carcinogenic is not ethically acceptable.  Therefore, we have to rely on observational evidence, animal studies and test-tube experiments. The IARC study analyzed more than 800 studies, most of which were observational in nature.  In observational studies, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship. There might be other unhealthy lifestyle habits related to processed meat intake that are responsible for the observed association.  However, the evidence linking processed meat and cancer is consistent across different populations, which makes the chance of bias less likely. It is also supported by animal and test-tube experiments.  According to IARC’s research summary, the evidence linking processed meat with cancer is sufficient.  Bottom Line: As evaluated by the IARC, there is sufficient evidence that processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer. There is no major reason to doubt their conclusion.  How is the Cancer Risk Increased?  It is not fully understood how red meat or processed meat increase cancer risk.  However, there are several plausible mechanisms. Below is an overview of the three main suspects.  N-Nitroso Compounds (NOCs)  High consumption of red meat and processed meat promotes the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in the digestive system ( 2 ).  NOCs cause low-grade damage to the lining of the colon, which may increase the risk of cancer over time ( 3 , 4 ).  However, processed red meat is likely more harmful, as it contains chemicals that increase the formation of NOCs, especially when it is exposed to high heat ( 5 ).  Dietary fiber and chlorophyll, the green pigment in vegetables, may counteract this risk ( 6 , 7 ).  Heterocyclic Amines (HCAs)  Cooking meat at high temperatures leads to the formation of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) ( 8 ).  HCAs cause cancer in animals, and may possibly increase cancer risk in humans ( 9 ).  The risk of HCAs may be reduced by eating veggies, such as cruciferous vegetables, or marinating your meat with certain spices ( 10 , 11 ).  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)  High amounts of PAHs are formed when meat is cooked under high temperatures or smoked ( 12 ).  PAHs can damage the intestinal lining, but whether this happens after meat consumption in humans has not yet been investigated ( 13 ).  Bottom Line: High-temperature cooking promotes the formation of several carcinogenic substances, such as NOCs, HCAs and PAHs. Avoid charring your meat and use gentle cooking methods.  How Much Processed Meat Can You Safely Eat?  Conducting randomized controlled trials on meat and cancer is extremely difficult.  For this reason, we do not know exactly how much red meat or processed meat you can safely eat.  This probably depends on the individual and the dietary context.  Additionally, the effect is clearly dose-dependent, and excessive consumption of processed meat is risky.  One meta-analysis estimated that for every 50 grams of processed meat eaten per day, the risk of colon cancer increases by 18% ( 14 ).  Bottom Line: The amount of meat you can safely eat is unknown. However, the dose makes the poison, and eating high amounts of processed meat is not advised.  Some High-Quality Studies Disagree  All this being said, two long-term randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of a “low-fat” diet on the risk of cancer.  The participants in these studies changed many things at a time, including significantly reducing their consumption of processed meat and red meat.  These studies did not find a reduction in the risk of colon cancer ( 15 , 16 ).  This indicates that the advice to “eat less processed and red meat” may not be very effective at preventing colon cancer in the real world, at least not when combined with a conventional low-fat diet.  Bottom Line: Two long-term randomized controlled trials on low-fat diets, with less processed meat and red meat, did not find a reduction in the risk of colon cancer.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the IARC study concluded that eating high amounts of processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer.  Red meat, on the other hand, cannot be established as a cause of cancer. Yet, it was classified as a probable cause of cancer.  More evidence is needed on this subject. But for now, we can assume that it is best to limit the intake of processed meat.  If you’re going to eat red meat, then use gentler cooking methods and don’t burn or char your meat.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Oct 30th–Nov 6th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 6, 2015  This is an overview of interesting studies published on nutrition from Friday, Oct 30th, to Friday, Nov 6th, 2015.   Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two research papers, one published in Pediatric Obesity and one from PLoS One .  Monday  Link : Eating Less Sugar Has Multiple Health Benefits .  Study : Isocaloric Fructose Restriction and Metabolic Improvement in Children with Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome.  Summary : This trial in obese children examined the short-term effects of reducing added sugar and replacing it with starch.  The study showed that this had multiple health benefits, including reduced blood pressure, lower blood cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels and improved blood sugar control.  Wednesday  Link : Low-Fat vs Low-Carb Diet: Which is More Effective?  Study : Dietary Intervention for Overweight and Obese Adults: Comparison of Low- Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets. A Meta-Analysis.  Summary : This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared the effectiveness of low-carb diets and low-fat diets on several factors. These were: body weight, risk factors for heart disease, blood lipids and blood pressure.  Low-carb diets turned out to be more effective for weight loss than low-fat diets, and better at reducing risk factors for heart disease.  New Research From Around the World  Tons of research papers were published this week, on a wide range of subjects.  New issues of the Journal of Nutrition , the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and the British Journal of Nutrition came out, to name a few.  Below is a selection of the most interesting papers, organized by subject.  Obesity and Weight Loss  Resistant starch and protein intake enhances fat oxidation and feelings of fullness in lean and overweight/obese women.  Diets that are high in resistant starch and/or protein have been found to be effective in weight management.  This randomized crossover study showed that a diet high in both resistant starch and protein increased the feeling of fullness and the amount of calories burned.   Short-term variability in body weight predicts long-term weight gain.  This study in young women shows that fluctuations in weight over a period of a few months may be a sign of future weight gain.   Relationship between sleep duration and body mass index depends on age.  Poor sleep quality and short sleep duration are associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. This observational study examined how this association changes with age.   Ambient Temperature and Prevalence of Obesity: A Nationwide Population-Based Study in Korea.  Previous studies have suggested that high outdoor and indoor temperatures might increase the risk of obesity. This South Korean observational study supports this, with the authors mentioning adaptive thermogenesis as a possible explanation.   Effects of carbohydrate quantity and glycemic index on resting metabolic rate and body composition during weight loss.  This 17-week randomized, weight-loss trial examined the effects of four standardized diets that varied in percentage of calories from carbs. The carb amount ranged from 55% to 70%.  The study showed that the percentage of calories from carbs did not affect changes in fat mass, lean mass and metabolic rate during weight loss. However, this study did not test the effectiveness of a low-carb diet.   Skipping breakfast in early childhood and its associations with maternal and child BMI: a study of 2–5-year-old Australian children.  This Australian observational study found that skipping breakfast was associated with higher body mass index (BMI) in both children and their mothers.   Association of food consumption with total volumes of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue in a Northern German population.  This cross-sectional observational study from Northern Germany found that potatoes and cakes were associated with increased belly fat.   Resting metabolic rate varies by race and by sleep duration.  Poor sleep quality and short sleep duration are associated with an increased risk for obesity. This randomized trial in healthy adults found that short sleep duration resulted in lower metabolic rate the morning after.  In other words, poor sleep causes the body to burn fewer calories. This association was stronger in African-Americans, compared to Caucasians.   Appetite  Plasma acyl-ghrelin increases after meal initiation: a new insight.  Ghrelin is the appetite hormone. For this reason, high appetite is accompanied by high levels of ghrelin. Ghrelin levels fluctuate throughout the day, generally rising before meals and falling after meals.  This study found that ghrelin levels rose after a meal had started. This probably temporarily increased appetite during the meal. After the meal finished, ghrelin levels fell, as was expected.   Metabolic Syndrome  Everything in Moderation – Dietary Diversity and Quality, Central Obesity and Risk of Diabetes.  This observational study suggests that diet quality is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. However, it did not find any significant links between dietary diversity and central obesity or diabetes.  To improve metabolic health it is simply not enough to eat many different foods in moderation — these foods also have to be healthy.   Metabolically Healthy Obesity Is Not Associated with Food Intake in White or Black Men.  This observational study suggests that healthy obesity is not associated with a healthy diet. In other words, overeating healthy food does not guarantee that you’ll become healthily obese. There are other, as yet, unknown factors at work.   Could the beneficial effects of dietary calcium on obesity and diabetes control be mediated by changes in intestinal microbiota and integrity?  This review discusses the possibility that the benefits of dietary calcium on obesity and diabetes could be affected by intestinal bacteria.   Blood Sugar Control and Type 2 Diabetes  Radiologic evidence that hypothalamic gliosis is associated with obesity and insulin resistance in humans.  Gliosis is a term that refers to changes in glial cells as a response to central nervous system damage. Glial cells are the most common cells in the nervous system. They surround neurons, supporting and insulating them.  This human study found an association between gliosis in the brain and insulin resistance. The association was independent of the amount of fat mass.   Two healthy diets modulate gut microbial community improving insulin sensitivity in a human obese population.  Bacteria in the digestive system, also called the gut microbiota, are affected by specific dietary patterns, especially if they are followed for a long period.  This randomized trial in obese individuals showed that following the Mediterranean diet, or a low-fat diet high in complex carbs, helped protect against type 2 diabetes by causing beneficial changes in the gut microbiota.   The effect of soy intake on metabolic profiles of women with gestational diabetes mellitus.  This randomized controlled trial in women with gestational diabetes suggests that soy protein may improve blood sugar control, lower triglycerides and reduce oxidative stress, compared to animal protein.   Consumption of meat is associated with higher fasting glucose and insulin concentrations regardless of glucose and insulin genetic risk scores: a meta-analysis of 50,345 Caucasians.  This large meta-analysis of observational studies did not find any significant links between red and processed meat intake and fasting glucose and insulin, after adjustment for other potential causal factors.   Effects of Mediterranean-style diet on glycemic control, weight loss and cardiovascular risk factors among type 2 diabetes individuals: a meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that the Mediterranean diet may improve blood sugar control, body weight and heart disease risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes.   The evaluation of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers on coffee–diabetes association: results from the 10-year follow-up of the ATTICA Study (2002–2012).  This observational study suggests that long-term coffee consumption may protect against type 2 diabetes.  Although this doesn’t proove a causal relationship, anti-inflammatory compounds in coffee may possibly explain the association.   Heart Health  Egg consumption and risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke: results from 2 prospective cohorts.  In general, this observational study did not find any significant associations between egg consumption and heart disease in individuals with diabetes.  However, it found an increased risk of heart failure in men when eggs were eaten more than once per day.   Artery Health  L-carnitine intake X atherosclerosis risk.  L-carnitine is a substance found in foods, such as red meat, and is also taken as a supplement. Dietary L-carnitine is changed into trimethylamine by bacteria in the digestive system. In the liver, it is metabolized into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO).  This mouse study indicates that TMAO may slow down the development of heart disease. More specifically, it can slow down the formation of lesions in the body’s main artery, the aorta.   Oral microbiota in patients with atherosclerosis.  Previous studies indicate that bacteria in the mouth may affect the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis.  This study showed that the bacterial community in the mouth was similar in healthy individuals and patients with atherosclerosis. However, patients with atherosclerosis had greater numbers of Anaeroglobus .   Blood Pressure  Concordance with DASH diet and blood pressure change: results from the Framingham Offspring Study (1991–2008).  DASH stands for “dietary approaches to stop hypertension.” It is a dietary pattern designed and promoted by the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  This observational study suggests that following the DASH diet does not improve blood pressure in middle-aged adults.   Long-term intake of animal flesh and risk of developing hypertension in three prospective cohort studies.  Previous studies indicate that red and processed meats may have adverse effects on heart health. Conversely, seafood is believed to be protective, whereas the relevance of poultry is controversial.  This observational study found that long-term consumption of meat and poultry was associated with high blood pressure. Additionally, it found a weak but significant association between seafood and high blood pressure.   The Effect of the Mediterranean Diet on Hypertension: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  This meta-analysis combined the results of 6 trials examining the effects of the Mediterranean diet on high blood pressure.  The study found that following the Mediterranean diet for at least one year reduced blood pressure. However, the authors concluded that the evidence was weak.   Association of Processed Meat Intake with Hypertension Risk in Hemodialysis Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study.  This cross-sectional observational study in hemodialysis patients showed an association between processed meat intake and high blood pressure.   Acute effects of calcium supplements on blood pressure and blood coagulation: secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial in post-menopausal women.  Some previous studies suggest that calcium supplements may increase the risk of heart disease.  This randomized controlled trial in post-menopausal women found that calcium supplements increased blood pressure and blood coagulation.   Longitudinal association of dairy consumption with the changes in blood pressure and the risk of incident hypertension: the Framingham Heart Study.  This observational study suggests that consuming dairy products may improve blood pressure.   Blood Lipids  Effects of Vegetarian Diets on Blood Lipids: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  This meta-analysis combined the results of 11 randomized controlled trials examining the effects of vegetarian diets on blood lipids.  The study showed that vegetarian diets effectively lower blood fats, including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol. For this reason, they may be useful for people with disorders that cause high levels of blood fats.   Fruit and vegetable consumption and hypertriglyceridemia: Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) 2007–2009.   This cross-sectional observational study suggests that high fruit consumption may reduce blood triglyceride levels in South Korean people.   Randomised controlled trial of the effect of long-term selenium supplementation on plasma cholesterol in an elderly Danish population.  This 5-year randomized controlled trial in elderly people did not find any significant effects of selenium supplementation on circulating cholesterol levels.   Cancer  Beta-Sitosterol: A Promising but Orphan Nutraceutical to Fight Against Cancer.  Beta-sitosterol is a type of sterol found in plants, categorized as a phytosterol. This review discusses beta-sitosterol’s potential use in cancer treatment.   Carotenoids, retinol, tocopherols, and prostate cancer risk: pooled analysis of 15 studies.  This study combined results from 15 observational studies. It found that high blood levels of retinol (vitamin A) were linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer.  Conversely, high levels of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) were associated with a reduced risk for prostate cancer.   Alcohol consumption and risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma in women and men: 3 prospective cohort studies.  High alcohol consumption has been associated with an increased frequency of sunburns, which is a risk factor for skin cancer.  This prospective observational study supports previous studies. Alcohol consumption was linked with a higher risk of skin cancer in both men and women.   Prospective associations between vitamin D status, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.  Previous studies suggest that vitamin D may protect against cancer caused by tobacco use. This prospective observational study suggests that high vitamin D status may protect against tobacco-related cancers.   The effect of fruit and vegetable intake on the development of lung cancer: a meta-analysis of 32 publications and 20 414 cases.  This meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that high intake of fruit and vegetables may protect against lung cancer. The association was stronger in women than men.   Brain and Mental Health  Docosahexaenoic acid biostatus is associated with event-related functional connectivity in cortical attention networks of typically developing children.  Previous studies suggest that long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are important for nervous system development.  This cross-sectional observational study indicates that good DHA status is linked with improved brain activity in developing children.   Maternal Obesity and Excessive Gestational Weight Gain Are Associated with Components of Child Cognition.  This observational study found that the children of obese mothers were, on average, less intelligent than children of normal-weight mothers. Additionally, mothers who gained more weight during pregnancy had children that were less intelligent.   Adherence to the DASH diet in relation to psychological profile of Iranian adults.  DASH stands for “dietary approaches to stop hypertension.” It is a dietary pattern designed and promoted by the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  This observational study in Iranian adults found that following the DASH diet was associated with increased risk of depression.   Digestive Health  Low-FODMAP formula improves diarrhea and nutritional status in hospitalized patients receiving enteral nutrition: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial.  FODMAPs are a category of carbs that are poorly absorbed. They may cause digestive discomfort in some people, especially those with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease.  This randomized trial in patients receiving enteral nutrition showed that a diet low in FODMAPs improved diarrhea and nutritional status while also promoting recovery.   Respiratory Health  Investigating the effects of arctic dietary intake on lung health.  This observational study suggests that a diet high in vegetables and arctic marine mammals, such as seals, may improve lung function in Inuits from Greenland.   Dental Health  Higher Intakes of Fruits and Vegetables, β-Carotene, Vitamin C, α-Tocopherol, EPA, and DHA Are Positively Associated with Periodontal Healing after Nonsurgical Periodontal Therapy in Nonsmokers but Not in Smokers.  Periodontitis, or gum disease, is characterized by inflammation in the tissues that surround the teeth. It is caused by a strong immune reaction to the bacteria that live on the teeth.  This observational study found that high fruit and vegetable intake, including high amounts of beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E, is associated with less periodontitis after treatment. This association was not significant in smokers.   Bone Health  Identification of a dietary pattern prospectively associated with bone mass in Australian young adults.  This observational study in young, Australian adults found that diets high in protein, calcium and potassium were associated with higher bone mineral density.   Nutrient and food intakes in early life and risk of childhood fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis combined the results of 18 observational studies. It found that the risk of bone fractures was higher in children who avoided milk products and those who were not breastfed as infants.  Consuming a high amount of calories, cheese and sugar-sweetened beverages was also associated with an increased risk of fractures.   No increase in risk of hip fracture at high serum retinol concentrations in community-dwelling older Norwegians: the Norwegian Epidemiologic Osteoporosis Studies.  This observational study in elderly Norwegian adults found no association between circulating vitamin A or vitamin D and the risk of hip fractures.   Fertility and Pregnancy  Urinary Phytoestrogens Are Associated with Subtle Indicators of Semen Quality among Male Partners of Couples Desiring Pregnancy.  Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that resemble the female sex hormone, estrogen. Nuts and soy products are among the richest dietary sources of phytoestrogens.  This observational study suggests that high levels of phytoestrogens in semen may indicate high male fertility and semen quality. However, they were not associated with couple fertility.   Infant Nutrition  Effects on childhood body habitus of feeding large volumes of cow or formula milk compared with breastfeeding in the latter part of infancy.  This observational study in children indicates that consuming high amounts of cow’s milk or milk formula in late infancy is associated with faster weight and height gain, compared to breastfeeding.   Immune Health, Inflammation and Infections  High-dose vitamin D3 in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.  Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by a certain type of bacteria. It typically affects the lungs and is characterized by persistent cough, bloody mucus and fever. Individuals with tuberculosis are often vitamin D deficient.  This randomized controlled trial in tuberculosis patients found that vitamin D supplementation improved circulating vitamin D levels, but did not improve the symptoms of tuberculosis.   High salt reduces the activation of IL-4– and IL-13–stimulated macrophages.  This mouse study indicates that excessive salt consumption may have harmful effects on the immune system. It may raise the risk of exaggerated inflammation and autoimmune disorders.   A Single Meal Containing Raw, Crushed Garlic Influences Expression of Immunity- and Cancer-Related Genes in Whole Blood of Humans.  This small randomized crossover trial showed that eating garlic, 5 g/day for 10 days, increased the activity of 7 genes related to immune function, programmed cell death, and the metabolism of foreign substances in the body.   The effect of vitamin D supplementation on selected inflammatory biomarkers in obese and overweight subjects: a systematic review with meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis concludes that vitamin D supplementation does not have any significant effects on systemic inflammation in obese and overweight people.   Allergies and Food Intolerances  Gluten consumption during late pregnancy and risk of celiac disease in the offspring: the TEDDY birth cohort.  According to this observational study, the amount of gluten eaten during late pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of gluten intolerance in the child.   Eye Health  Adherence to a Mediterranean diet, genetic susceptibility, and progression to advanced macular degeneration: a prospective cohort study.  Macular degeneration is a condition that results in loss of vision because of damage to the retina of the eye. It usually affects elderly adults and is one of the main causes of blindness.  This observational study suggests that following the Mediterranean diet may protect against age-related macular degeneration. Genetic predisposition can modify this association.   Hearing Health  Latent iron deficiency at birth influences auditory neural maturation in late preterm and term infants.  Latent iron deficiency among pregnant mothers in India is associated with poor maturation of neurons involved with hearing in preterm infants.   Carotenoids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folate and risk of self-reported hearing loss in women.  This observational study indicates that higher intake of folate, beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin may protect against hearing loss.   Healthy Aging  The Role of Energy Balance in Successful Aging Among Elderly Individuals: The Multinational MEDIS Study.  This observational study indicates that excessive calorie intake is associated with lower quality of life in elderly people.   Two-Year Whey Protein Supplementation Did Not Enhance Muscle Mass and Physical Function in Well-Nourished Healthy Older Postmenopausal Women.  This was a 2-year, randomized controlled trial that studied post-menopausal women. It found that supplementing with 30 grams of protein per day, on top of a diet that already provided adequate protein, did not increase muscle mass or physical function.   Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Intake of macro- and micronutrients in Danish vegans.  This study showed that the diet of Danish vegans was low in certain micronutrients. It did not reach recommendations for protein, vitamin D, iodine and selenium. Among vegan women, vitamin A intake was also below recommendations.  On the other hand, the intake of added sugar, sodium and fat was more in accordance with official recommendations, compared to the general public in Denmark.   Vitamins and Minerals  A randomized two way cross over study for comparison of absorption of vitamin D3 buccal spray and soft gelatin capsule formulation in healthy subjects and in patients with intestinal malabsorption.  This was a randomized crossover trial in healthy adults and patients with poor digestive absorption.  It showed that a mouth spray, containing vitamin D3, is more effective at raising circulating vitamin D levels than vitamin D in gelatin capsules.   Selenium deficiency occurs in some patients with moderate-to-severe cirrhosis and can be corrected by administration of selenate but not selenomethionine: a randomized controlled trial.  Selenomethionine is the main form of selenium in the diet. After absorption, the liver converts it to selenide, the active form of selenium. However, this conversion is impaired in patients with liver disease, such as cirrhosis.  For this reason, patients with cirrhosis often have mild selenium deficiency. This randomized controlled trial showed that selenate is more effective than selenomethionine in patients with cirrhosis.   {alpha}-Tocopherol bioavailability is lower in adults with metabolic syndrome regardless of dairy fat co-ingestion: a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.  Taking vitamin E supplements with fat is presumed to increase vitamin E absorption. However, this randomized crossover study showed that absorption of vitamin E is not increased when it is taken with dairy fat, regardless of health status.  Additionally, the study found that people with metabolic syndrome have a lower alpha-tocopherol absorption, compared to healthy individuals.   Association between body weight and composition and plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the Diabetes Prevention Program.  This cross-sectional observational study found that higher body weight was associated with lower circulating vitamin D levels in adults with pre-diabetes.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Low-Fat vs Low-Carb Diet: Which is More Effective?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 4, 2015  A low-calorie, low-fat diet is frequently recommended for weight loss.  However, strong evidence suggests that low-carb diets may be more effective ( 1 , 2 ).  Recently, scientists set out to examine this issue further. They conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared low-fat diets to low-carb diets.  Here, we provide a detailed summary of the main results.   Background  Low-fat diets have traditionally been recommended for weight loss.  There are two reasons for this.  First off, fat is the most energy-dense macronutrient. Second, saturated fat used to be believed to increase the risk of heart disease ( 3 ).  However, many studies do not support the idea that low-fat diets are very effective for weight loss ( 4 , 5 , 6 ).  In fact, strong evidence points toward low-carb diets being more effective. These diets typically limit carbohydrate intake to less than 20–30% of total calorie intake, and are higher in protein and fat ( 7 , 8 ).  Study Reviewed  A group of US researchers compared the effectiveness of low-carb and low-fat diets on causing weight loss and improving risk factors for heart disease.  Dietary Intervention for Overweight and Obese Adults: Comparison of Low- Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets. A Meta-Analysis.  Basic Study Design  This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared the effectiveness of two weight loss diets: low-carb and low-fat.  The researchers selected 17 randomized controlled trials that included a total of 1797 overweight and obese participants.  These trials had a few things in common:   They ranged from 8 to 24 months in duration.  The low-carb diet contained less than 120 grams of carbs per day.  The low-fat diet contained less than 30% of calories from fat per day.   This analysis compared the effects of low-fat and low-carb diets on changes in body weight, blood lipids and blood pressure.  Bottom Line: This was a meta-analysis that combined the results of 17 randomized trials. These trials compared the effects of low-carb and low-fat diets on weight loss and risk factors for heart disease.  Finding 1: Low-Carb Diets Cause More Weight Loss  While both low-carb and low-fat diets may cause significant weight loss, low-carb diets seem to be more effective.  In fact, the probability of greater weight loss on a low-carb diet, compared to a low-fat diet, was more than 99%.  The chart below shows the difference in weight loss between groups.   These findings are supported by previous studies on low-carb diets ( 8 ).  Part of the reason for this may be that low-carb diets also tend to be higher in protein than low-fat diets. Protein can have beneficial effects on body weight.  Bottom Line: Both low-fat and low-carb diets can help you lose weight, but people tend to lose more weight on low-carb diets.  Finding 2: Low-Carb Diets Are Better For Heart Health  Both diets reduced risk factors for heart disease.  Low-carb diets caused greater improvements in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, while low-fat diets affected total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol more favorably.  The chart below shows the changes in blood lipids in both groups.   Additionally, improvements in systolic blood pressure were slightly better in the low-carb group, with a difference of 1.7 mmHg between groups.  The probability of a low-carb diet causing a greater reduction in heart disease risk was calculated as 98%.  Overall, these results are consistent with previous studies on low-carb diets ( 8 , 9 ).  Bottom Line: Low-carb diets caused greater improvements in several heart disease risk factors. The differences were modest, but statistically significant.  Limitations  This study appears to have been well-designed and followed a precise protocol.  However, there were a few limitations to the trials included in the analysis.  First, patient-level data was not available for all of the studies. This limited the researchers’ ability to fully evaluate the quality of the studies they used.  Second, a substantial amount of the studies’ participants dropped out, and the drop-out rate differed significantly between studies. However, according to analyses, this should not have affected the overall results.  Finally, the scores calculated for heart disease risk were based on assumptions that were not verifiable.  The study was supported by a grant from Atkins Nutritionals, a company that produces low-carb products. This does not invalidate the findings, but should be mentioned.  Bottom Line: This study was well-designed and followed a strict protocol. The limitations appear to be minimal.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study found low-carb diets to be more effective for weight loss than low-fat diets.  Additionally, low-carb diets appeared to be slightly better at improving risk factors for heart disease, such as blood lipids and blood pressure.  All that being said, the best diet for you is the one you can stick to in the long run. A low-carb diet can work very well, but only if you stick to it.

https://authoritynutrition.com/research/health-benefits-of-reducing-sugar/
	Eating Less Sugar Has Multiple Health Benefits  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  November 2, 2015  Excessive fructose consumption is believed to be one of the main causes of metabolic syndrome.  Fructose makes up 50% of table sugar, which is the most commonly consumed sweetener in the world.  A recent study, published in Pediatric Obesity , investigated whether replacing sugar with starch would improve markers of metabolic syndrome in children.  Here is a detailed summary of the findings.   Background  Although metabolic syndrome is mainly associated with obesity, some normal-weight children have similar symptoms ( 1 ).  Additionally, type 2 diabetes is more common than obesity in Chinese and Indian children. This indicates that metabolic syndrome is not solely explained by excessive calorie intake ( 2 ).  In fact, one of the main suspects is fructose, a type of sugar found in virtually all sugar-sweetened foods.  Fructose has several properties that make it particularly unhealthy when eaten in high amounts:   Liver fat accumulation: Excessive intake leads to liver fat accumulation and increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).   Oxidative stress: Fructose increases oxidative stress, which may disrupt cellular function ( 6 ).   Overeating: Fructose does not suppress appetite as efficiently as glucose, and may therefore promote overeating ( 7 , 8 ).   For these reasons, limiting fructose from added sugars may have many health benefits.  Study Reviewed  Researches from California set out to investigate the metabolic effects of replacing sugar with starch for children with obesity and metabolic syndrome.  Isocaloric Fructose Restriction and Metabolic Improvement in Children with Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome.  Basic Study Design  This 9-day trial in 43 obese children with metabolic syndrome investigated the short-term health effects of reducing sugar and fructose.  The participants’ normal diets were characterized by high amounts of added sugar. Their average sugar intake was 28% of total calories.  To examine the effects of fructose restriction, the participants followed a weight-maintenance diet that reduced sugar and fructose to 10% and 4% of total calories, respectively, and replaced it with starch .  The diet contained similar proportions of protein, fat and carbs as their habitual diet before the study.  At the beginning and end of the study, the researchers measured body composition, blood sugar, insulin, blood pressure and blood lipids.  Bottom Line: This was a 9-day trial in obese children with metabolic syndrome. Its purpose was to examine the health effects of reducing dietary sugar and fructose and replacing it with starch.  Finding 1: Eating Less Fructose Improved Blood Pressure  During the study period, diastolic blood pressure decreased by 4.9 mmHg, on average.  Conversely, systolic blood pressure did not decrease significantly.  These results are supported by observational studies in children and adolescents that found an association between dietary fructose intake and both diastolic and systolic blood pressure ( 9 , 10 ).  Bottom Line: Reducing sugar intake significantly improved diastolic blood pressure, but not systolic blood pressure.  Finding 2: Less Dietary Sugar Improved Blood Lipids  The blood lipid profile also improved significantly during the study:   Fasting triglycerides: -46%.  LDL-cholesterol: -13%.   These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that high-fructose diets can have adverse effects on the blood lipid profile ( 11 , 12 ).  Bottom Line: Eating less fructose improved the blood lipid profile, causing a significant reduction in fasting triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol.  Finding 3: Eating Less Sugar Improved Blood Sugar Control  Blood sugar control improved substantially during the course of the study:   Fasting blood sugar: -6%.  Fasting insulin: -53%.  Peak insulin: -56%.  Insulin resistance: -58%, according to HOMA-IR .   Also, the body’s response to glucose ingestion improved significantly, according to the results of an oral glucose tolerance test .  These improvements were not associated with either weight loss or a calorie deficit. This suggests that the benefits were mostly caused by the reduction in sugar intake.  Bottom Line: Reducing sugar intake improves blood sugar control, fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin and insulin resistance.  Finding 4: Eating Less Sugar Caused Weight Loss  During the study, body weight decreased by 1%, or 0.9 kg (2 lbs), on average.  Since the participants were supposed to have been on a weight-maintenance diet, the weight loss is probably not explained by substantial fat loss.  There are a few factors that likely contributed to the weight loss:   Reduced water retention: Less sugar intake may have decreased water retention . The weight loss took place in the first 4 days, suggesting loss of water weight.   Decreased lean mass: Lean mass decreased significantly, or by 0.6 kg (1.3 lbs). Since water weight is a part of the lean mass measurement, this further supports that the weight loss may have been due to reduced water retention.   Less food intake: 77% of the participants reported that they were unable to eat all of the food provided by the researchers. This may have led to weight loss. However, fat mass reduction was not significant, according to DXA .   Although most participants did lose weight, a total of 10 participants did not lose weight during the study. However, these participants still experienced health benefits similar to the children who did lose weight.  The researchers concluded that the health benefits seen in the present study could not be explained by the small amount of weight loss.  Bottom Line: Overall, the participants lost weight during the study. This weight loss may be largely attributed to less water retention.  Limitations  This was a well-designed and well-executed study. However, there were a few limitations.  By replacing sugar with starch and adding fiber, the overall glycemic index of the diet was reduced.  It is possible that some of the findings were, at least, partly caused by a reduction in the glycemic index of the diet, rather than a decrease in fructose ( 13 ).  Also, the study had no control group. For this reason, we do not know if other study-related factors had an effect.  Bottom Line: The study was designed well and there is no reason to doubt the results. The findings are also supported by previous studies.  Summary and Real-life Application  The study showed that eating less sugar has multiple health benefits.  In summary, reducing sugar and fructose intake:   Reduced blood pressure.  Lowered blood cholesterol.  Decreased triglyceride levels.  Improved blood sugar control.   These results happened in only 9 days. Restricting fructose for a longer period of time may have resulted in even greater health benefits.  Simply put, reducing your intake of added sugar is one of the best things you can do for your health.  Tags: Fructose , Metabolic syndrome , Obesity , Sugar

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Oct 23rd â Oct 30th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 30, 2015  This is an overview of interesting studies published on nutrition from Friday, Oct 23rd, to Friday, Oct 30th, 2015.   Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two research papers, one published in Diabetes and one from the British Journal of Nutrition .  Monday  Link : Type of Dietary Fat May Affect Body Composition.  Study : Overfeeding polyunsaturated and saturated fat causes distinct effects on liver and visceral fat accumulation in humans.  Summary : This randomized trial compared the effects of eating high amounts of saturated fat or polyunsaturated fat.  The study found that high amounts of saturated fat from palm oil led to a greater increase in visceral fat than polyunsaturated fat from sunflower oil. Additionally, sunflower oil led to an almost three times greater increase in lean body mass.  Wednesday  Link : The Benefits of Vitamin D May Depend on Your Genes.  Study : Vitamin D receptor Cdx-2-dependent response of central obesity to vitamin D intake in the subjects with type 2 diabetes: a randomised clinical trial.  Summary : This randomized trial examined the effects of daily vitamin D supplements on body fat and blood sugar control. It also compared the response of different genotypes to vitamin D supplements.  The study showed that not all people benefit equally from vitamin D supplements. While vitamin D may promote weight loss and improve blood sugar control in some people, others do not achieve similar benefits. This depends on people’s genes.  Other Research From Around the World  As usual, many papers were published this week, ranging from randomized controlled trials to scientific reviews.  Below is an overview of the most interesting nutrition research, categorized by subject.  Obesity and Weight Loss  Sugar and artificially sweetened beverage consumption and adiposity changes: National longitudinal study.  This observational study in children found that consuming both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages is associated with body fat gain in the UK.   Weight loss-induced changes in adipose tissue proteins associated with fatty acid and glucose metabolism correlate with adaptations in energy expenditure.  Weight loss causes the body to start conserving energy — a condition called “starvation mode.” This 8-week trial found that weight loss causes changes in the levels of specific proteins involved in the metabolism of fat cells.   A randomized controlled trial: the effect of inulin on weight management and ectopic fat in subjects with prediabetes.   Inulin is a type of fermentable dietary fiber. Animal studies indicate that fermentable dietary fiber may promote weight loss.  This 18-week randomized controlled trial found that inulin supplementation improves the effectiveness of a weight loss diet, compared with cellulose. Additionally, inulin caused a greater reduction in liver and muscle fat.   Effect of low-fat diet interventions versus other diet interventions on long-term weight change in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that during a calorie deficit, high-fat diets lead to greater weight loss, compared to low-fat diets. Low-fat diets lead to greater weight loss only when compared to a “usual” diet.  Overall, there is no evidence to support low-fat diets over other types of weight loss diets.   Energy Expenditure Responses to Fasting and Overfeeding Identify Phenotypes Associated With Weight Change.   This trial investigated whether individual responses to fasting and overfeeding were associated with future changes in body weight.  The study found that those who had a greater reduction in calories burned during a 24-hour fast were more likely to have gained weight 6 months later. Simply put, those who are better at conserving energy are predisposed to weight gain.   Metabolic Syndrome  Effects of different dietary approaches on inflammatory markers in patients with metabolic syndrome – a systematic review and meta analysis.  Sustained low-grade inflammation is associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of health conditions including central obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension and a poor blood lipid profile.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that low-fat and low-carb diets may be effective against inflammation.   Isocaloric fructose restriction and metabolic improvement in children with obesity and metabolic syndrome.   This trial in obese children with metabolic syndrome found that reducing dietary fructose for 9 days improved blood pressure, glucose tolerance, and circulating levels of triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and insulin.   Heart Disease  Reduced ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to arachidonic acid is associated with early onset of acute coronary syndrome.  Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a term for any conditions that suddenly reduce blood flow to the heart. Low ratios of omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids have previously been implicated in the development of ACS.  This observational study supported earlier findings. It found that low ratios of omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids increased the risk of early ACS in men, but not in women.   Does increased red and processed meat consumption lead to an elevated cardiovascular disease risk in women?  This observational study suggests that eating high amounts of red and/or processed meat may increase the risk of heart disease in women. These associations were stronger for processed meat.   Blood Sugar Control and Type 2 Diabetes  Phosphorus ingestion improves oral glucose tolerance of healthy male subjects: a crossover experiment.  This small cross-over experiment in men found that taking 500 mg of phosphorus with 75 g of glucose reduced subsequent blood sugar levels and insulin, and improved insulin sensitivity, compared with the ingestion of glucose alone.   Cancer  Circulating Concentrations of Vitamin B6 and Kidney Cancer Prognosis: A Prospective Case-Cohort Study.  Previous observational studies indicate that low circulating levels of vitamin B6 may increase the risk of kidney cancer.  This observational study supports previous studies. Additionally, it found low levels of vitamin B6 to be associated with increased risk of death from kidney cancer.   Digestive Health  Intestinal Microbiota Profiles of Healthy Pre-School and School-Age Children and Effects of Probiotic Supplementation.  This study in children found that probiotic supplementation caused a significant improvement in the digestive environment by increasing the numbers of beneficial bacteria, while reducing undesirable species of bacteria.  However, 6 months after the supplementation stopped, the digestive environment had returned back to its original state.   Single High-Dose Oral Vitamin D3 Therapy (Stoss): A Solution to Vitamin D Deficiency in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease?  Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in children with inflammatory bowel disease.  This study showed that taking a single, high dose of vitamin D3 maintained an adequate vitamin D status for at least 6 months in children with inflammatory bowel disease.   Brain Health and Function  Vitamin D Status at Birth and Future Risk of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  This observational study found no association between vitamin D status at birth and attention deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) disorder later in life, compared with children without ADHD.   Diets  Micronutrient status and intake in omnivores, vegetarians and vegans in Switzerland.  This observational study in Swiss vegans, vegetarians and non-vegetarians suggests that all three diets can fulfill dietary requirements for vitamins and minerals. However, they need to be well-balanced and supplements are necessary in some cases.  Non-vegetarians had the lowest intakes of magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin and folic acid. Conversely, vegans consumed low amounts of calcium, and had very low intakes of vitamin D and B12.   Vitamins and Minerals  The impact of MTHFR 677 C/T genotypes on folate status markers: a meta-analysis of folic acid intervention studies.  MTHFR is an enzyme that serves an essential function in folate metabolism. In some people, MTHFR is slightly different, making them predisposed to folate deficiency. These people are of the MTHFR 677TT genotype.  This meta-analysis supports previous studies. Those with the MTHFR 677TT genotype had higher homocysteine levels in blood, less folate and did not respond as well to folate supplementation, compared to other people.   Supplements  Adulteration of Dietary Supplements by the Illegal Addition of Synthetic Drugs: A Review.  This review discusses the addition of illegal substances to dietary supplements. They are most frequently added to supplements intended for weight loss, muscle building and improved exercise performance. This is a rising health concern.   Plant Compounds  Health Benefits of Punicic Acid: A Review.   Punicic acid is polyunsaturated fatty acid, categorized as a conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Pomegranate seeds are the main dietary source of punicic acid.  This review discusses the potential health benefits of punicic acid. It is considered more potent than ordinary CLAs, and some studies indicate that it may help prevent diabetes, obesity and cancer.  Tags: Weekly recap

	The Benefits of Vitamin D May Depend on Your Genes  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 28, 2015  Even though obesity has been associated with poor vitamin D status, the evidence that vitamin D affects obesity is not entirely conclusive ( 1 ).  For this reason, researchers set out to examine the effects of vitamin D supplements on body fat levels, insulin sensitivity and circulating vitamin D levels. They also looked at the effects of genetics on responses to vitamin D ( 2 ).  Here is a detailed summary of the results, recently published in the British Journal of Nutrition .   Background  Central obesity involves having a lot of fat around the waist. It is primarily caused by excessive belly fat, especially around the organs.  Central obesity has been associated with various chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  Some people are more prone to central obesity than others, which may be partially explained by genetic factors.  Nutritional factors, such as poor vitamin D status, may also play a role ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Study Reviewed  Iranian researchers examined the effects of daily vitamin D supplements on markers for central obesity. They also investigated whether these effects depended on individual genetic make-up.  Vitamin D receptor Cdx-2-dependent response of central obesity to vitamin D intake in the subjects with type 2 diabetes: a randomised clinical trial.  Basic Study Design  This was a 12-week, randomized trial in 60 Iranian men and women with type 2 diabetes. 88% of the participants were obese, while the rest were overweight.  Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Vitamin D group: Twice a day for 12 weeks, participants consumed a 250 ml yogurt drink fortified with 12.5 Âľg of vitamin D3.   Placebo group: The participants consumed the same yogurt drink, containing no vitamin D3.   At the beginning and the end of the study, the researchers measured body weight, total body fat, visceral fat, circulating vitamin D levels, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HbA1c.  These values were then compared between groups.  In the second part of the study, the genetic make-up of participants in the vitamin D group was examined. This is discussed below.  Bottom Line: This was randomized trial in diabetic and overweight Iranian men and women. Participants were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D supplementation or a placebo.  Genotype Groups  A genotype simply refers to the genetic make-up of each individual.  For example, when referring to individuals that have different variants of a specific gene, we talk about different genotypes.  The present study focused on variants of the Cdx-2 gene, which is associated with vitamin D function.  The participants were divided into three groups, depending on their genotype:   AA genotype: 52% had the AA variant of the Cdx-2 gene.   AG genotype: 32% had the AG variant of the Cdx-2 gene.   GG genotype: 16% had the GG variant of the Cdx-2 gene.   The benefits of vitamin D supplementation were then compared between genotypes.  Other studies have also examined the frequency of these genotypes, which appears to vary by race. For example, the AA genotype is found in 18% of South Asians, but only 4% of Europeans ( 8 , 9 ).  Bottom Line: The study divided the study participants into three groups based on genotype. The benefits of vitamin D supplementation were then compared between genotypes.  Finding 1: Vitamin D Levels Did Not Increase in All Genotypes  Overall, circulating vitamin D levels increased significantly in many of the participants who were given vitamin D supplements.  However, vitamin D levels did not increase for everyone receiving supplements.  They only rose significantly in people who had the AA genotype, or in about 52% of the participants in the vitamin D group. Vitamin D levels did not increase for people who had the AG or GG genotype.  The table below shows the rise in vitamin D between genotypes.   These results indicate that not all people benefit from vitamin D supplementation.  This unexpected finding needs to be confirmed by other studies before any solid conclusions can be reached.  Bottom Line: Vitamin D levels did not increase in all of those who were supplemented. In fact, they rose only in those who had the AA genotype.  Finding 2: Vitamin D Decreased Body Fat  Waist circumference, visceral fat, truncal fat and fat mass percentage all decreased more in the vitamin D group, compared to the placebo.  Additionally, within the vitamin D group, waist circumference, visceral fat, fat mass percentage and truncal fat decreased more in participants with the AA genotype.  The table below shows the difference in total fat percentage between genotypes.   These results indicate that supplementing with vitamin D may be a useful weight loss strategy, at least for some people.  Bottom Line: Supplementing with vitamin D reduced central obesity. However, this effect was only significant in participants with the AA genotype.  Finding 3: Vitamin D Improved Insulin Sensitivity  Insulin sensitivity increased significantly in the vitamin D group, compared with the placebo.  Within the vitamin D group, insulin sensitivity increased most among those with the AA genotype.  No significant differences were seen in other markers of blood sugar control.  Bottom Line: Vitamin D supplementation appears to improve insulin sensitivity, benefitting people with type 2 diabetes. These effects were more pronounced in participants with the AA genotype.  Limitations  This study appears to have been well-designed and executed.  However, some of the research methods were inaccurate. For example, the researchers used bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure body fat.  BIA may underestimate body fat percentage as fat levels get higher ( 10 ).  The results also cannot be generalized to all people, since the participants were Iranian. These findings need to be confirmed in other racial groups.  Additionally, the participants were middle-aged and elderly, as well as diabetic and overweight or obese. Vitamin D supplementation may have different effects in healthy, young people.  Finally, the study period was only 12 weeks. Although this is a relatively long period for a randomized trial, a longer study might have told a different story.  Bottom Line: The study appears to have been well-designed and executed, although some of the methods were inaccurate. The results also may not be generalized to all people or supplementation time frames.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, this study shows that vitamin D supplementation can have many health benefits.  These include better vitamin D status, reduced fat mass and improved blood sugar control.  However, not all people benefit equally from vitamin D supplementation. The benefits appear to depend on people’s genes.  This reminds us that generalizing is not always appropriate in nutritional science. People sometimes react differently to what they are eating.  At the end of the day, vitamin D supplementation may provide many health benefits. The magnitude of these benefits varies, depending on people’s genetic make-up.

	Type of Dietary Fat May Affect Body Composition  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 26, 2015  The role of dietary fat in body fat distribution is not well known.  However, some interesting results from the LIPOGAIN study were published in the July, 2014 issue of Diabetes .  This study compared the effects of overfeeding saturated and polyunsaturated fat on fat accumulation and body composition.  Here is a detailed summary of the findings.   Background  Visceral fat accumulates in the abdominal cavity, around organs such as the intestines, liver and pancreas.  Conversely, ectopic fat accumulates inside the organs themselves, mainly the liver and pancreas.  Both visceral and ectopic fat are associated with an increased risk of chronic disease, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Combined, the adverse health consequences of visceral and ectopic fat are known as metabolic syndrome . For this reason, well-designed research on the causes of visceral and ectopic fat is extremely valuable.  Study Reviewed  A team of Swedish scientists set out to investigate the effects of eating high amounts of saturated fat and polyunsaturated fat on body composition and the accumulation of visceral and ectopic fat.  Overfeeding Polyunsaturated and Saturated Fat Causes Distinct Effects on Liver and Visceral Fat Accumulation in Humans.  Basic Study Design  This was a 7-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial in 39 young and normal-weight men and women.  The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of eating high amounts of either saturated fat or polyunsaturated fat.  Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Saturated fat group: Participants were overfed with muffins high in saturated fat for 7 weeks. The fat was in the form of refined palm oil, which is rich in palmitic acid , the most common saturated fat in the modern diet.   Polyunsaturated fat group: Participants were overfed with muffins high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fat for 7 weeks. The fat was in the form of refined sunflower oil, which is rich in linoleic acid .   The amount of muffins was adjusted so that each participant would achieve a 3% weight gain during the study period.  On average, the daily amount of oil added to the muffins was about 40 grams, and the calorie excess was 750 kcal per day.  The researchers measured total body fat, visceral fat, abdominal skin fat, liver fat, pancreatic fat and lean tissue.  Bottom Line: This study was a randomized controlled trial in healthy, normal-weight individuals. It compared the effects of overeating palm oil and sunflower oil on fat accumulation and body composition.  Finding 1: Fat Mass and Lean Mass Gain Were Affected  Participants in both groups gained equal amounts of weight, or 1.6 kg (3.5 lbs).  However, those who were fed saturated fat gained significantly more fat mass, whereas polyunsaturated fat led to a greater increase in lean mass .  In fact, the ratios of lean and fat tissue gain in the polyunsaturated and saturated fat groups were approximately 1:1 and 1:4, respectively.  The chart below shows changes in fat mass and lean mass in both groups.   This difference remained, even when total body water content was taken into account.  These findings are supported by previous studies, one in postmenopausal women and one in rats ( 4 , 5 ).  However, exactly how this works is unknown. It is also unclear what the current study’s increase in lean tissue actually represents or signifies.  Bottom Line: Eating high amounts of saturated fat caused more fat accumulation than eating polyunsaturated fat. Additionally, polyunsaturated fat appeared to cause a greater increase in lean mass.  Finding 2: Saturated Fat Caused More Visceral Fat Gain  There are two types of belly fat:   Subcutaneous : This type of belly fat is stored directly underneath the skin.   Visceral: This type of belly fat is stored inside the abdominal cavity , surrounding the intestines, liver and pancreas.   Visceral fat is much more harmful than subcutaneous fat, and is associated with various chronic diseases.  In the present study, participants who were fed saturated fat gained significantly more visceral fat, compared with those who got polyunsaturated fat. In fact, the difference was nearly two-fold.  The chart below shows the differences in visceral fat changes between groups.   These results suggest that overeating polyunsaturated fat may cause less fat accumulation in the abdominal cavity, compared to saturated fat.  That being said, overeating is still unhealthy, no matter what you are eating â overeating polyunsaturated fat just seems to be less bad.  Bottom Line: Eating high amounts of saturated fat from palm oil caused more visceral fat accumulation than eating polyunsaturated fat from sunflower oil.  Finding 3: Saturated Fat Caused More Liver Fat Gain  Participants who were overfed with saturated fat gained significantly more liver fat than those who ate polyunsaturated fat.  The chart below shows the differences in liver fat changes between groups.   These results are well supported by several other studies.  Observational studies have found high dietary intake of saturated fats, and low intake of polyunsaturated fats, to be associated with increased liver fat ( 6 , 7 , 8 ).  Fatty livers also contain low levels of polyunsaturated fat. Additionally, a clinical trial found that the polyunsaturated fat in sunflower oil reduced liver fat, compared to a diet rich in saturated fat ( 7 , 9 , 10 ).  Accumulation of liver fat may lead to an adverse condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFLD). NFLD is present in up to 75% of obese people ( 11 ).  Fatty liver is believed to contribute to the development of many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ).  Bottom Line: Eating high amounts of saturated fat from palm oil caused greater liver fat accumulation than eating polyunsaturated fat.  Finding 4: Pancreatic Fat Decreased in Both Groups  On average, pancreatic fat decreased by 31%. There was no significant difference between groups.  This unexpected finding cannot be explained based on the study’s results, and needs to be confirmed by other studies before any solid conclusions can be reached.  Bottom Line: Pancreatic fat decreased significantly in both groups. The finding needs to be confirmed in other studies before any conclusions can be made.  Limitations  This high-quality study appears to be well-designed and executed. Nevertheless, there are several limitations worth mentioning.  Sunflower Oil Contains More Vitamin E  Sunflower oil contains more vitamin E than palm oil, and vitamin E may reduce liver fat ( 17 ). However, the amount of vitamin E in the sunflower oil was probably too low to have any significant effects.  The Results May Not Be Generalized  The study tested palm oil and sunflower oil, and may not be generalized to all saturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Other Nutrients May Play a Role  The dietary context may play an important role in how the body reacts to high amounts of fat.  The muffins provided to participants were also high in fructose and refined carbs, which could have affected the findings.  The Study Examined Only Lean Individuals  All study participants were lean, so the results may not apply to obese or diabetic individuals.  Bottom Line: The study was well designed and executed. There are a few limitations, so the results should not be generalized.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study shows that dietary fat type may affect fat distribution and body composition.  To summarize the findings:   High amounts of palm oil (palmitic acid) led to greater liver and visceral fat gain, compared to sunflower oil.   High amounts of sunflower oil (linoleic acid) led to almost a three times greater increase in lean body mass, compared to palm oil.   Simply put, palm oil caused fat accumulation in places associated with adverse health outcomes. Conversely, sunflowers oil caused less fat gain overall and much greater gain in lean mass.  These results are of limited value for health-conscious consumers, since they may only apply to those that are overeating and gaining weight. However, a previous study showed a similar effect during a weight-maintenance diet ( 10 ).  That being said, this doesnât necessarily mean that saturated fat is unhealthy, only that eating too much of it may have worse consequences compared to eating an equal amount of polyunsaturated fat. At least in the context of a high-calorie diet.  At the end of the day, overeating should be avoided and fat intake should be balanced.  Tags: Body fat , Polyunsaturated fat , Saturated fat

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Oct 16th – Oct 23rd)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 23, 2015  This is an overview of interesting research articles published from Friday, Oct 16th, to Friday, Oct 23rd.   Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two research papers, one from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and one from Obesity .  Monday  Link:  The Paleo Diet May Help Fight Metabolic Syndrome.   Study:  Paleolithic nutrition for metabolic syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis.  Summary: This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared the paleo diet with other dietary patterns.  The study showed that the paleo diet may have moderate benefits for metabolic syndrome, compared to diets based on official nutrition guidelines.  Wednesday  Link:  Probiotics May Help Prevent Weight Gain.   Study:  Probiotic supplementation attenuates increases in body mass and fat mass during high-fat diet in healthy young adults.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial examined whether a broad-spectrum probiotic supplement could reduce weight gain on a high-fat, high-calorie diet.  The study showed that people who took a probiotic supplement gained significantly less weight than those who took the placebo.  Other New Research From Around the World  Tons of new studies were published this week. Many journals released new papers online and a new issue of the British Journal of Nutrition came out.  Here is an overview of the most interesting nutrition research, categorized by subject.  Obesity and Weight Loss  NMR-based metabolic profiling in healthy individuals overfed different types of fat: links to changes in liver fat accumulation and lean tissue mass.  This paper presented results from the LIPOGAIN study, a randomized trial that compared the effects of eating high amounts of saturated fats (SF) or polyunsaturated fats (PF).  SF caused greater total fat gain and accumulation in the liver and belly than PF, even though the weight gain was the same. It was hypothesized that overfeeding with PF may be associated with higher insulin sensitivity than overfeeding with SF.   Effects of overweight and obesity on motor and mental development in infants and toddlers.  This observational study suggests that obese, young children are more likely to have delays in mental and motor development than their normal-weight counterparts.   Lean and obese dietary phenotypes: differences in energy and substrate metabolism and appetite.   This study examined the effects of a high-fat meal on appetite and metabolic profiles in lean, high-fat consumers; lean, low-fat consumers; and obese, high-fat consumers (OHF).  Appetite ratings were similar for all, but the LHF group had greater fat burning capacity than the LLF group. The hunger/appetite hormones ghrelin and PYY changed more in the lean groups, but this response was weaker in the OHF group.   Dietary Intervention for Overweight and Obese Adults: Comparison of Low-Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets. A Meta-Analysis.  This was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of low-carb and low-fat diets for weight loss. It concluded that both diets lead to significant weight loss. However, low-carb diets seem to be slightly more effective.   Metabolic Syndrome  High serum carotenoids associated with lower risk for the metabolic syndrome and its components among Japanese subjects: Mikkabi cohort study.  This observational study suggests that a diet rich in carotenoids may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in Japanese people.   Vitamin D status is associated with cardiometabolic markers in 8–11-year-old children, independently of body fat and physical activity.  This observational study suggests that good vitamin D status may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, poor blood lipid profile and metabolic syndrome.   Magnesium status and the metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that high magnesium levels are associated with reduced risk of metabolic syndrome. However, there was a large amount of variability between individuals.   Heart Health  Vinegar decreases blood pressure by down-regulating AT1R expression via the AMPK/PGC-1α/PPARγ pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats.  This rat study found that vinegar may lower blood pressure. The effect is caused by the acetic acid in vinegar.   Food supplementation with rice bran enzymatic extract prevents vascular apoptosis and atherogenesis in ApoE−/− mice.  This study showed that long-term supplementation with rice bran extract lowers cholesterol levels and prevents clogged blood vessels in mice that are predisposed to atherosclerosis.   Blood Sugar Control and Type 2 Diabetes  The glycaemic outcomes of Cinnamon, a review of the experimental evidence and clinical trials.  This reviewed the evidence of cinnamon’s effect on blood sugar control and type 2 diabetes. It concluded that cinnamon may be useful for treating type 2 diabetes, when combined with mainstream treatment and other healthy lifestyle strategies.  However, the evidence is inconclusive, and the high coumarin content of cassia cinnamon is a health concern. Ceylon cinnamon is a safer option.   The effect of macronutrients on glycaemic control: a systematic review of dietary randomised controlled trials in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes in which there was no difference in weight loss between treatment groups.  This systematic review concludes that there is no optimal diet for treating type 2 diabetes in overweight and obese people. Losing weight is crucial, but the dietary strategy is less important.   Urinary isoflavonoids and risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective investigation in US women.  Isoflavonoids, or isoflavones, are plant compounds found in legumes, especially soybeans. Two of the most common isoflavonoids in soy are daidzein and genistein.  This observational study found that the amount of daidzein and genistein in urine was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in US women.   Cancer  Inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell migration by plasma anthocyanins isolated from healthy volunteers receiving an anthocyanin-rich berry juice.  Anthocyanins are antioxidant plant compounds found in many colorful fruits and vegetables. After they are absorbed from the digestive tract, they are metabolized by the liver.  This study indicates that anthocyanin metabolites, isolated from the blood of healthy adults, may help prevent the spread of pancreatic cancer cells.   A Trial of Calcium and Vitamin D for the Prevention of Colorectal Adenomas.  Previous observational studies indicate that high intake of vitamin D or calcium may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.  This double-blind, randomized controlled trial found that daily supplementation with calcium (1200 mg), vitamin D3 (1000 IU) or a combination of both did not reduce the risk of recurrent colorectal cancer during a period of 3 to 5 years.   An update on Curcuma as a functional food in the control of cancer and inflammation.  Curcumin is a plant compound found in the Indian spice turmeric. This review discusses recent studies on the potential use of curcumin in the treatment of inflammation and cancer. Overall, its efficacy is considered questionable.   Egg and cholesterol intake and incident type 2 diabetes among French women.  This observational study in French women found that high cholesterol intake was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, egg consumption was not associated with type 2 diabetes.   Digestive Health  Effect of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis , BB-12®, on defecation frequency in healthy subjects with low defecation frequency and abdominal discomfort: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial.  This randomized controlled trial found that supplements of the probiotic bacterium Bifidobacterium animalis can increase the frequency of bowel movements.  This suggests that B. animalis may improve digestive health and reduce the risk of constipation.   Brain Health and Function  Consumption of anthocyanin-rich cherry juice for 12 weeks improves memory and cognition in older adults with mild-to-moderate dementia.  Anthocyanins are a group of antioxidant polyphenols responsible for the color of many fruits and vegetables.  This randomized controlled trial found that drinking 200 ml of cherry juice, rich in anthocyanins, daily for 12 weeks, may improve memory in older people with mild or moderate dementia. Juice that was low in anthocyanins did not have similar effects.   Prospective study on the association between diet quality and depression in mid-aged women over 9 years.  This observational study indicates that long-term adherence to an overall healthy diet may reduce the risk of depression.   The impact of gut microbiota on brain and behaviour: implications for psychiatry.  This review suggests that certain psychiatric disorders might be treated by changing the bacterial community in the gut.   Gluten-free and casein-free diets in the therapy of autism.  This review concludes that most studies on the efficacy of gluten-free and casein-free diets for treating autism are poorly designed. There is limited evidence to support the use of gluten-free and casein-free diets in the treatment of autism.   The beneficial effects of berries on cognition, motor behaviour and neuronal function in ageing.  This study of rats suggests that eating berries may improve motor function and cognition, especially memory.   Respiratory Health  Intake of high fructose corn syrup sweetened soft drinks is associated with prevalent chronic bronchitis in U.S. Adults, ages 20–55 y.  This cross-sectional observational study suggests that high consumption of sugary soft drinks, sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, may contribute to chronic bronchitis.   Infections and Immune Health  IgY antibodies in human nutrition for disease prevention.  This review hypothesizes that IgY antibodies, found in egg yolks, may be useful in the treatment or prevention of bacterial infections in the digestive system.   Allergies and Intolerance  B vitamins related to homocysteine metabolism in adults celiac disease patients: a cross-sectional study.  The only known treatment for celiac disease is the gluten-free diet. However, this small, cross-sectional observational study indicates that celiac disease patients adhering to a gluten-free diet had low folate intake and low levels of folate in blood.   Hearing  Low-fat and low-protein diets are associated with hearing discomfort among the elderly of Korea.  This observational study showed that low protein and fat intake was associated with hearing problems among elderly people.   Supplements  Emergency Department Visits for Adverse Events Related to Dietary Supplements.   This study estimated that dietary supplements are responsible for 23,000 emergency department visits every year in the US. This includes 2154 hospitalizations. Weight loss supplements were most often involved.   Higher plasma quercetin levels following oral administration of an onion skin extract compared with pure quercetin dihydrate in humans.  Quercetin is one of the most common antioxidant flavonoids found in plant foods. It is also sold as a supplement.  This randomized controlled trial showed that quercetin aglycone, found in the skin of onions, is much better absorbed than quercetin dihydrate, found in many supplements.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Probiotics May Help Prevent Weight Gain  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 21, 2015  Probiotics are bacteria that have health benefits when consumed. They are found in probiotic supplements and some fermented foods.  Several studies indicate that probiotics can be useful in the battle against weight gain and obesity ( 1 ).  This study examined the effects of a broad-spectrum probiotic supplement on weight gain during a high-fat, high-calorie diet.   Background  People who have obesity and/or type 2 diabetes may have more undesirable bacteria in their digestive system than beneficial bacteria ( 2 ).  Although the cause of this imbalance is not entirely clear, evidence indicates that high-fat, high-calorie diets may cause unfavorable changes in the bacterial environment in the gut ( 3 ).  This may be the cause of the systemic inflammation associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ).  For this reason, dietary strategies that positively affect the gut bacteria may potentially benefit people with obesity or metabolic diseases.  One such strategy is supplementation with probiotic bacteria, like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium .  Previous studies have shown that probiotics may decrease the growth of undesirable bacteria and reduce inflammation in the digestive system ( 7 ).  Study Reviewed  Researchers at Virginia Tech set out to examine whether a probiotic supplement would reduce weight gain on a high-fat, high-calorie diet.  Probiotic Supplementation Attenuates Increases in Body Mass and Fat Mass During High-Fat Diet in Healthy Young Adults.  Basic Study Design  This was a 4-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 20 healthy, non-obese men, aged 18–30 years.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Probiotic group: Participants received a broad-spectrum probiotic supplement called VSL#3. Two doses of VSL#3, each containing 450 billion probiotics of 8 different strains, were consumed daily in a milkshake.   Placebo group: Participants in the placebo group received milkshakes containing cornstarch instead of probiotics.   All participants were also put on a weight-gain diet, containing an excess of 1000 calories. This diet was high in fat, containing 55% fat, 30% carbs and 15% protein.  Several variables were measured at the beginning and the end of the study; these included body composition, insulin sensitivity, endotoxins and inflammatory markers.  Bottom Line: This was a 4-week, randomized controlled trial in 20 healthy, non-obese men. They were assigned to one of two groups: probiotic supplementation and placebo.  Finding 1: Probiotic Supplementation Reduces Weight Gain  The probiotic supplementation reduced gain in body mass and fat mass, compared to the placebo.  The chart below shows the difference in weight gain between groups.   These results are consistent with other studies that have reported weight loss in obese people taking probiotic supplements ( 8 , 9 ).  An additional study showed that taking probiotic supplements might reduce weight gain during 7 days of overfeeding ( 10 ).  The present study shows that these effects are sustained for up to 4 weeks.  How probiotics reduce weight gain is unclear, but it may have something to do with the amount of calories that are absorbed from the digestive system ( 11 , 12 ).  Further studies are needed to determine exactly how this works.  Bottom Line: Probiotic supplements reduced gain in body mass and fat mass in people who were fed a high-fat, high-calorie diet.  Finding 2: Effects on Insulin Sensitivity  The high-fat, high-calorie diet did not affect insulin sensitivity in the participants.  Probiotic supplementation also had no effects on insulin sensitivity, and these results are consistent with a few previous studies ( 13 , 14 ).  However, they conflict with one study showing that probiotic supplementation may prevent development of insulin resistance during 7 days on a high-fat, high-calorie diet ( 10 ).  Other studies also indicate that probiotic supplementation may reduce or prevent insulin resistance ( 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ).  The reason for this inconsistency is unclear.  Bottom Line: Neither the high-fat diet nor the probiotic supplements had any effects on insulin sensitivity. Other studies have provided mixed results.  Finding 3: Effect on Endotoxins  Endotoxins, also known as lipopolysaccharides , are found in the membranes of some gut bacteria.  These compounds may find their way into the blood circulation of individuals with an imbalance in the bacterial environment in the gut.  In fact, previous studies have shown that high-fat, high-calorie diets may cause a small increase in the levels of endotoxins in blood ( 3 , 19 ).  In the present study, the levels of endotoxins did not change in either group.  Bottom Line: A high-fat, high-calorie diet did not affect levels of endotoxins in blood. Probiotic supplementation did not affect endotoxins either.  Finding 4: Effect on Inflammation  Systemic inflammation is estimated by measuring inflammatory markers in the blood.  The present study measured three inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).  TNF-α increased significantly in both groups during the 4 weeks of the high-fat, high-calorie diet.  CRP did not change significantly during the study period. IL-6 seemed to increase, but the change was not statistically significant.  Probiotic supplementation had no effects on the change in inflammatory markers.  Bottom Line: The high-fat, high-calorie diet increased levels of TNF-α, a marker of inflammation. Probiotic supplementation did not affect this increase.  Limitations  The study was well designed. However, as in most studies, there were a few important limitations.  For starters, the number of participants was low. A larger number of participants would have increased the statistical power of the study.  Second, the study included only healthy, non-obese men. For this reason, the results cannot be generalized. The effects might be different in obese people or women.  The probiotic supplement also contained multiple strains of bacteria, which may have different effects on health. For this reason, it is unclear which probiotic bacteria were responsible for suppressing weight gain.  Bottom Line: This study was well designed and conducted. However, the number of participants was low and the findings may not apply to women or people with obesity.  Summary and Real-Life Application  This study evaluated whether probiotic supplements would help protect against the adverse effects of consuming a high-fat, high-calorie, weight-gain diet.  Neither the diet nor the probiotics had significant effects on insulin sensitivity or endotoxin levels.  The diet did cause an increase in one inflammatory marker, but the probiotics did not have any effect.  However, this study did show that people who took a probiotic supplement gained significantly less weight and fat mass. This indicates that probiotics may be an effective way to prevent weight gain and obesity.  Probiotics may even be useful for weight loss if the diet is not hypercaloric, but the current study did not test that.  Tags: Obesity , Probiotics , Weight loss

	The Paleo Diet May Help Fight Metabolic Syndrome  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 19, 2015  In the past decade, the Paleolithic diet (or paleo diet) has gained considerable popularity due to its claimed health benefits.  However, it differs from official dietary recommendations in many ways. For example, it excludes all grains, dairy products and industrially processed food.  Several studies have investigated the health effects of the paleo diet. This meta-analysis examined its effects on metabolic syndrome.   Background  Metabolic syndrome is a group of adverse conditions associated with abdominal obesity.  These include the following risk factors for type 2 diabetes and heart disease:   Abdominal obesity.  Elevated blood sugar.  Elevated blood pressure.  High blood triglycerides.  Low HDL-cholesterol.   An underlying cause of metabolic syndrome is thought to be the modern processed diet, causing low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance ( 1 , 2 ).  For this reason, it is very likely that diets based on unprocessed, whole foods, like the paleo diet, may improve health among people with metabolic syndrome.  Study Reviewed  Scientists from Bahrain and the Netherlands did a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared the paleo diet with other dietary patterns.  Paleolithic nutrition for metabolic syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis.  Basic Study Design  The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  They combined results from many conceptually similar studies and performed new statistical analyses.  This meta-analysis included four randomized controlled trials ( I , II , III , IV ) with a total of 159 participants.  The researchers then compared these findings to control diets based on nutrition guidelines from around the world.  The main research question of this review was: Does adhering to a Paleolithic diet improve metabolic risk factors?  Finding 1: The Paleo Diet Improved Body Composition  The paleo diet resulted in greater improvements in body composition than the diets based on official health recommendations.  Below is an overview of how the paleo diet differed from the control diets in the short-term. The numbers represent the mean difference.   Body weight: -2.69 kg (-5.9 lbs).  Waist circumference: -2.38 cm (-0.94 in).   Supporting this, a few other trials have shown that going on the paleo diet may reduce body weight and improve body composition ( 4 , 5 ).  Bottom Line: The Paleolithic diet resulted in greater reductions in body weight and waist circumference than diets based on official health recommendations.  Finding 2: The Paleolithic Diet Reduced Heart Disease Risk  Compared to the control diet, the Paleolithic diet also improved several other risk factors for heart disease.   Triglycerides: -0.40 mmol/L.  Systolic blood pressure: -3.64 mm Hg.  Diastolic blood pressure: -2.48 mm Hg.   HDL-cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels were also reduced, but the differences between the diets were not significant.  A few other human trials on the paleo diet have provided similar results ( 3 , 4 , 5 ).  Bottom Line: The Paleolithic diet resulted in greater improvements in heart disease risk factors than diets based on official nutritional recommendations.  Finding 3: Effects on Blood Sugar Control  The paleo diet resulted in significant reductions in both fasting blood sugar and insulin.  However, changes in blood sugar and insulin were not significantly different between diets.  One uncontrolled trial also showed significant improvements to blood sugar control on a paleo diet ( 3 ).  Bottom Line: The Paleolithic diet resulted in improvements in blood sugar control. However, the difference between diets was not significant.  How Does the Paleolithic Diet Improve Metabolic Syndrome?  There are several possible reasons why the paleo diet may have an advantage over conventional diets.   Paleolithic nutrition contains almost no carbs that are high on the glycemic index . Eating lots of high-glycemic foods may increase low-grade inflammation and the risk of insulin resistance ( 6 ).   Paleolithic diets contain no processed foods. They are exclusively based on whole foods, including fruits and vegetables.   Paleolithic diets contain no refined vegetable oils. Many vegetable oils are high in omega-6 fats, and may cause unfavorable ratios between omega-3 and omega-6. This may cause chronic, low-grade inflammation ( 7 , 8 ).   Bottom Line: Paleolithic diets do not contain any processed foods or foods that are high on the glycemic index. This may help prevent low-grade inflammation and reduce the risk of insulin resistance.  Limitations  This meta-analysis appears to be well designed and not have any serious limitations. The control diets were also relatively similar.  However, the included studies had a few potential limitations:   Most of the studies had few participants and were short in duration.   The paleo diet prescribed in the studies may not accurately represent what “paleo” eaters consume in the real world.   In three of the studies, the dietary intervention was in the form of advice and recommendations. Compliance may have been an issue in some of these studies ( 9 , 10 , 11 ).   None of the included trials were fully blinded. This might have affected their results.   Although the present meta-analysis tried to standardize the time-point data, the duration still ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months ( 10 , 11 ).   Although the test and control diets in all 4 studies were reasonably similar, there were some differences. Even slight variations in macronutrient composition may have strong effects on health outcomes.   One of the included trials had a baseline imbalance. Participants in the Paleolithic group had significantly worse outcome values at the start of the study compared to the control group ( 10 ).   Only one study reported adverse effects, and none of them assessed quality of life.   Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, the study shows that a paleo diet may have moderate benefits for metabolic syndrome.  However, the authors of the article believe that more evidence is needed before Paleolithic nutrition can be recommended in official guidelines.  Additionally, it is debatable whether total avoidance of dairy and grains is necessary, or even advantageous, for optimal health.  That being said, it is clear that avoiding processed foods and adhering to a diet based on whole foods is sound nutritional advice.  Tags: Metabolic syndrome , Paleo diet

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Oct 9th – Oct 16th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 16, 2015  This is an overview of interesting scientific articles published from last Friday (Oct 9th) until today (Oct 16th).   Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two papers, one from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and another from the Journal of Nutrition .  Monday  Link:  Butter vs Cream – Not All Dairy Fat is Equal.   Study:  Potential of Milk Fat Globule Membrane in Modulation of Plasma Lipoproteins, Gene Expression, and Cholesterol Metabolism in Humans: A Randomized Study.  Summary This randomized trial examined the effect of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) on blood lipids.  Butter oil contains virtually no MFGMs, while whipping cream is rich in them. Consuming butter oil caused an increase in blood cholesterol, but consuming whipping cream did not.  This indicates that MFGMs protect against the rise in cholesterol associated with saturated fat consumption.  Wednesday  Link:  High-Protein Breakfasts Burn Calories and Reduce Hunger.   Study:  Breakfasts Higher in Protein Increase Postprandial Energy Expenditure, Increase Fat Oxidation, and Reduce Hunger in Overweight Children from 8 to 12 Years of Age.  Summary This was a randomized crossover study in children that examined the effect of a high-protein breakfast on calories burned and appetite, compared to a high-carb breakfast.  The study found that a high-protein breakfast resulted in more calories burned and a greater reduction in appetite.  Other New Research From Around the World  Many new studies were published in the past week. New issues of the British Journal of Nutrition and the Proceedings of the Nutrition Society came out.  Here is an overview of the most interesting nutrition research, categorized by subject.  Obesity and Weight Loss  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with visceral abdominal tissue in Caucasian subjects.  This cross-sectional observational study found that people on the Mediterranean diet had lower body mass index, waist circumference and belly fat.   Mechanism of ER Stress and Inflammation for Hepatic Insulin Resistance in Obesity.  Insulin resistance in the liver is a common side effect of obesity. Although the exact cause of this association is unclear, it may be due to inflammation.  This review discusses inflammation and its role in metabolic diseases, obesity and insulin resistance.   Vitamin D receptor Cdx-2 -dependent response of central obesity to vitamin D intake in the subjects with type 2 diabetes: a randomised clinical trial.  This randomized clinical trial in subjects with type 2 diabetes found that taking vitamin D reduced fat in the abdominal area, especially around the organs.   Replacing sugary drinks with milk is inversely associated with weight gain among young obesity-predisposed children.  This was a secondary analysis of the Healthy Start Study, a randomized controlled trial in Danish children.  It found that sugary drinks were associated with weight gain among children who were predisposed to gaining weight. It also showed that milk may be a good alternative to sugary drinks.   Probiotic supplementation attenuates increases in body mass and fat mass during high-fat diet in healthy young adults.  This randomized controlled trial found that daily supplementation with probiotics reduced gain in body mass and fat during a 4-week, high-fat, weight-gain diet.   Elevated ghrelin predicts food intake during experimental sleep restriction.  Ghrelin is a hormone that increases hunger. This randomized crossover study found that lack of sleep increased ghrelin levels, when compared to normal sleep.  It also showed that higher ghrelin levels were associated with increased calorie intake, indicating that a rise in ghrelin may be how sleep loss promotes obesity.   Metabolic Syndrome  Very-low-fat diets may be associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome in the adult population.   This cross-sectional observational study in Korean adults suggests that very low fat intake, or less than 15% of the total calorie intake, is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome.   Heart Health  A Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil or nuts improves endothelial markers involved in blood pressure control in hypertensive women.  This was an analysis of the PREDIMED study, a randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effect of the Mediterranean diet on heart disease risk factors.  The study found that eating nuts and extra virgin olive oil lowered blood pressure in hypertensive women.   Effects of sodium and potassium supplementation on endothelial function: a fully controlled dietary intervention study.  Endothelial dysfunction (ED) affects blood vessel diameter. It may adversely affect blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease. This randomized, controlled crossover study found that an increased sodium intake had an adverse effect on ED.  Sodium raised the levels of endothelin-1, a peptide that causes blood vessels to narrow. The study also showed that an increased potassium intake had a beneficial effect on ED.   Dietary patterns and CVD: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.  This meta-analysis of observational studies showed that prudent or healthy dietary patterns are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.   Dietary flavonoid intakes and CVD incidence in the Framingham Offspring Cohort.  Flavonoids are a large group of antioxidants found in fruit, vegetables and other plant foods. This observational study suggests that dietary flavonoids do not reduce the risk of heart disease.  However, it indicates that flavonols, a subclass of flavonoids, may have modest benefits.   Total, insoluble and soluble dietary fibre intake in relation to blood pressure: the INTERMAP Study.  This cross-sectional observational study suggests that high dietary fiber intake may promote lower blood pressure. Insoluble dietary fiber was associated with lower blood pressure, whereas soluble fiber was not.   Digestive Health  Preventive rather than therapeutic treatment with high fiber diet attenuates clinical and inflammatory markers of acute and chronic DSS-induced colitis in mice.  This study of mice suggests that prebiotic fiber may reduce the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It indicates that fiber may have a preventive value, while not being effective as a treatment for IBD.   Brain Health and Function  The effects of chronic trans-resveratrol supplementation on aspects of cognitive function, mood, sleep, health and cerebral blood flow in healthy, young humans.  Resveratrol is a compound found in many plants, including grapes and blueberries. Single doses of resveratrol have been shown to increase blood flow in the brain.  This randomized controlled trial found that 28-day resveratrol supplementation caused less fatigue, and increased diastolic blood pressure and blood flow. It did not seem to have any significant effects on cognitive function, mood or sleep.   A randomised trial of a medium-chain TAG diet as treatment for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy.   This randomized controlled trial in epileptic dogs found that a ketogenic diet, consisting of medium-chain triglycerides, reduced the frequency of seizures.   Fertility and Pregnancy  Folic acid supplements and risk for oral clefts in the newborn: a population-based study.  This observational study found that the occurrence of oral clefts in newborns was not associated with folic acid supplementation among their mothers.  However, folic acid supplementation appeared to protect against oral clefts that occurred alongside other birth defects.   Healthy Aging  Nutritional interventions in sarcopenia: a critical review.  Sarcopenia is an age-related loss of muscle mass and strength. This paper reviewed intervention studies that investigated the efficacy of various strategies against sarcopenia.  These include strength training, ensuring adequate protein intake and supplementation with beta-methylbutyrate (HMB).   Eating Behavior  Perceived eating norms and vegetable consumption in children.   This study showed that children’s eating habits were influenced by the behavior of other children. For example, children ate more vegetables if they thought that other children had been eating vegetables.   Predictors of the frequency of Australian children’s consumption of unhealthy foods.  Social norms and pestering behavior appeared to be major factors influencing the consumption of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods among Australian children.   Self-comparisons as motivators for healthy behavior.  The way people compare themselves to others has an effect on their health behavior. For example, if people feel fatter than their friends, they are more likely to engage in health-related behavior, such as exercising or dieting.   Vitamins and Minerals  The relationship between iodine nutrition and thyroid disease in lactating women with different iodine intakes.  This observational study in breastfeeding women indicates that excessive iodine intake causes low-grade hypothyroidism.   Supplements  Comparison of availability and plasma clearance rates of β -hydroxy- β -methylbutyrate delivery in the free acid and calcium salt forms.  β-hydroxy-β–methylbutyrate (HMB) is a common supplement used to increase muscle strength, performance and reduce recovery time after training. In supplements, it is usually bound to calcium as Ca-HMB.  This randomized crossover study compared the bioavailability of Ca-HMB and the free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA). HMB-FA turned out to be better absorbed than Ca-HMB.  Tags: Weekly recap

	High-Protein Breakfasts Burn Calories and Reduce Hunger  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 14, 2015  Obesity is a serious health concern.  In both children and adults, it may increase the risk of several chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  For successful weight loss, multiple strategies are usually required. One effective approach may be to eat more protein ( 1 ).  For this reason, researchers set out to see if high-protein breakfasts could help burn calories and reduce appetite in overweight and normal-weight children.   Background  “Calories burned” refers to the rate at which the body uses energy.  In more scientific terms, it is known as energy expenditure. When energy expenditure rises after a meal, it is referred to as the thermic effect of food .  Compared to fat and carbs, protein has a greater thermic effect and is considered very weight-loss friendly ( 2 ).  Protein contains many fewer calories than fat, by weight. And, although its calorie content is equal to that of carbs, eating more protein appears to speed up our metabolism. This temporarily increases the amount of calories burned ( 3 , 4 ).  Article Reviewed  Researchers at the University of Arkansas set out to examine whether a high-protein breakfast could help burn calories and reduce appetite, when compared to a high-carb breakfast.  The results were recently published in the Journal of Nutrition :  Breakfasts Higher in Protein Increase Postprandial Energy Expenditure, Increase Fat Oxidation, and Reduce Hunger in Overweight Children from 8 to 12 Years of Age.  Basic Study Design  The study was a randomized, crossover study in normal-weight and overweight children, aged 8â12.  A total of 35 girls and boys participated, but only 29 completed the study.  The children were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   High-protein breakfast : This breakfast contained 21% protein (18 g), 52% carbs and 27% fat. The calorie content was 344 kcal. It consisted of an egg, egg whites, butter, orange juice and two slices of white bread.   High-carb breakfast : This breakfast contained 4% protein (3 g), 67% carbs, and 29% fat. The calorie content was 327 kcal. It consisted of a frozen waffle, butter, maple syrup and orange juice.   Since the study had a crossover design, all participants had both types of breakfast on separate occasions.  The two breakfasts had a similar calorie content. The fiber and fat content was also controlled.  Immediately after eating breakfast, energy expenditure, fat and carb oxidation, appetite and blood sugar were measured over a 4-hour period.  Additionally, food intake was estimated at the end of the testing period by providing participants with a free lunch buffet and recording how much they ate.  Bottom Line: The study was a randomized, crossover trial in overweight and normal-weight children. The study compared the effects of high-protein and high-carb breakfasts on appetite and calories burned.  Finding 1: High-Protein Breakfasts Help Burn More Calories  The high-protein breakfast increased the amount of calories burned in both the normal-weight and overweight children.  Here is an overview of the main results:   Fat oxidation was 16% higher after the high-protein breakfast, compared to the high-carb breakfast.   Carb oxidation was 32% higher 4 hours after the high-protein breakfast, compared to the high-carb breakfast.   The effect of protein on calories burned is well known. Many studies have shown that high-protein meals increase the amount of calories burned, compared to meals that are high in carbs ( 2 , 5 ).  Bottom Line: The high-protein breakfast increased the amount of calories burned after the meal more than the high-carb breakfast did. This is supported by previous studies.  Finding 2: Protein is More Filling Than Carbs  All participants were less hungry and felt more full after the high-protein breakfast, compared to the high-carb breakfast.  Here are the results:   Hunger was 14% less after the high-protein breakfast.  Fullness was 32% greater after the high-protein breakfast.  Desire to eat was 30% less after the high-protein breakfast.   All of these differences were independent of body weight.  These results are supported by previous studies showing that eating high-protein meals may increase fullness and reduce hunger ( 5 , 6 ).  However, in the present study there was no significant difference in food intake between groups at the lunch buffet.  This is supported by one study in children who had a low-glycemic breakfast. While they remained full for a longer time, there was no effect on food intake at lunch ( 7 ).  Bottom Line: The high-protein breakfast was more filling than the high-carb breakfast, resulting in decreased hunger and increased fullness.  Finding 3: Protein Helps Burn More Calories in Overweight Children  In overweight children, the high-protein breakfast appeared to increase fat oxidation and energy expenditure to a greater extent than in normal-weight children.  After the high-protein breakfast, the energy expenditure was 4.09 and 3.68 kcal/240 min among the overweight and normal-weight children, respectively.  This indicates that protein may have stronger effects on burning calories in overweight children.  Bottom Line: The high-protein breakfast helped burn more calories in overweight children than it did in normal-weight children.  Finding 4: High-Protein Breakfasts May Help Moderate Blood Sugar Levels  Both breakfasts resulted in similar increases in blood sugar.  However, there were some differences:   Blood sugar levels were 10% higher 30 minutes after the high-carb breakfast, but only among normal-weight children.   Blood sugar levels were 6.3% higher 240 minutes after the high-protein breakfast.   These results indicate that the high-protein meal is better at moderating blood sugar levels and preventing large fluctuations.  This is supported by previous studies showing that diets high in protein may improve blood sugar control ( 8 , 9 , 10 ).  Bottom Line: There were only small differences in blood sugar levels between groups. However, there were some indications that a high-protein breakfast may be better at stabilizing blood sugar levels.  Limitations  The study had a few limitations:   The effects of high-protein and high-carb breakfasts were examined with only one test meal for each.   The participants were children. It is unclear if the results can be generalized to adults.   The study had few participants. A greater number of participants might have given different results.   The overweight and normal-weight participants had breakfasts with a similar calorie content. Since overweight children presumably have higher calorie intakes, this might have affected the results.   The high-protein breakfast contained only 22% protein. A higher protein content could have given different results.   Summary  In short, the study shows that high-protein breakfasts can help burn calories and reduce hunger.  They temporarily cause more calories to be burned, when compared to high-carb breakfasts. Additionally, they may help reduce appetite for a few hours.  At the end of the day, adding protein to your meals may be a valuable long-term strategy against weight gain and obesity.

https://authoritynutrition.com/research/butter-vs-cream/
	Butter vs Cream – Not All Dairy Fat is Equal  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 12, 2015  Not all dairy fat is equal.  Sometimes the fat is enclosed in a layer called the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), composed of phospholipids and protein.  The presence of MFGM may be the reason that the various dairy products have different effects on health.  Cream contains twice as much MFGM as butter, so researchers set out to study the health effects of these two dairy products.   Background and Introduction  Observational studies indicate that the relationship between dairy fat and heart disease depends on the type of dairy product consumed ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Supporting this, randomized controlled trials have found that butter raises cholesterol levels more than cheese, even though the fat content is equal ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Most dairy fat is enclosed in a layer called the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), which may be the cause of these differences. This membrane is primarily composed of phospholipids, but around 20% is protein ( 8 , 9 ).  Butter is an exception. When butter is produced, the churning process removes most of the MFGMs from the fat. In comparison, cream contains twice as much MFGM ( 8 ).  Bottom Line: Studies have indicated that different dairy products have varying effects on health markers, such as cholesterol levels. This may be due to the presence and quantity of MFGMs, which enclose the dairy fat.  Study Reviewed  Many years ago, scientists hypothesized that the presence of MFGMs may contribute to how dairy products affect several aspects of health ( 10 ).  Researchers at the Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden set out to test this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial.  The results were recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition:  Potential of Milk Fat Globule Membrane in Modulation of Plasma Lipoproteins, Gene Expression, and Cholesterol Metabolism in Humans: A Randomized Study.  Here, we discuss the main results of this study and their relevance to human health.  Basic Study Design  This was an 8-week, single-blind, randomized trial in healthy, overweight men and women. A total of 57 participants were recruited, but only 46 completed the study.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:   Cream : Participants consumed 40 g of milk fat per day in the form of whipping cream, which is very high in MFGMs.   Butter : Participants consumed 40 g of milk fat per day in the form of butter oil, containing virtually no MFGMs.   Additionally, the study examined the effects of the two diets on gene expression and markers of cholesterol formation and absorption.  The main research hypothesis was that milk fat enclosed in MFGMs, such as in cream, would raise cholesterol much less than fat without MFGMs.  Bottom Line: The study was a randomized trial. Participants were divided into two groups that received 40 g of milk fat. The only difference between groups was that the cream group got milk fat with MFGMs, but the butter group did not.  Finding 1: MFGMs in Dairy Fat Prevent an Increase in Cholesterol  The study confirmed the research hypothesis.  It clearly showed that butter increased the levels of blood cholesterol, whereas cream did not. These differences are likely caused by the presence of MFGMs in cream.  This chart shows how blood cholesterol rose in the butter and cream groups.   Here is an overview of how eating butter oil changed the levels of blood lipids and lipoproteins, compared to cream:   Total Cholesterol: +0.30 mmol/L compared to -0.04 mmol/L.   LDL-Cholesterol: +0.36 mmol/L compared to +0.04 mmol/L.   Ratio of Apolipoprotein B to Apolipoprotein A-I: +0.03 mmol/L compared to -0.05 mmol/L.   Non-HDL Cholesterol: +0.24 mmol/L compared to -0.14 mmol/L.   Butter caused a significant increase in all of these factors, which are known risk factors for heart disease ( 4 , 11 , 12 ).  However, not all blood lipids were significantly different between groups. For example, there was no difference in HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL:HDL ratio and apolipoprotein A-I.  Additionally, body weight and body composition remained relatively constant during the study. Body weight decreased slightly in the butter group, but the change was not statistically significant.  Simply put, these results indicate that butter fat has adverse effects on the blood lipid profile, whereas cream fat does not.  Supporting these findings, several animal studies have also shown that MFGMs may counteract the rise in cholesterol caused by saturated fats ( 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ).  Conversely, human studies have provided conflicting results ( 19 , 20 , 21 ).  However, unlike previous studies, the present study used whipping cream, containing intact MFGMs.  Bottom Line: Milk fat without MFGMs, such as butter, causes a rise in blood cholesterol. On the other hand, cream that contains MFGMs does not cause a significant increase in cholesterol.  Finding 2: MFGMs Appear to Change Gene Expression  How MFGMs moderate the effects of milk fat on blood lipids is unclear.  However, animal studies indicate that the MFGMs can lower blood cholesterol levels by changing gene expression in the liver ( 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ).  In the present study, gene expression was examined in 30 women, randomly selected from both groups.  The study found a significant group difference in the expression of 19 genes. The expression of all of these genes were increased in the MFGM group, but reduced in the butter oil group.  Although the function of most of these genes is not completely understood, some of them may be involved in the regulation of blood lipids.  In fact, changes in the expression of some of these genes were associated with increases in cholesterol.  Bottom Line: MFGMs may work by affecting gene expression, preventing a rise in cholesterol.  Finding 3: MFGMs May Reduce Cholesterol Absorption  In addition to changing gene expression, MFGMs may affect blood lipids by reducing cholesterol absorption in the digestive system.  This is supported by animal studies showing that sphingolipids or a mixture of milk phospholipids may reduce cholesterol absorption ( 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ).  The current study did not indicate any differences in cholesterol absorption between groups. However, the measurements were based on indirect markers for cholesterol absorption.  Bottom Line: Animal studies indicate that MFGMs may decrease cholesterol levels by reducing its absorption. The present study does not support this.  Discussion of Cream Consumption and Limitations of the Study  This study indicates that cream does not raise the levels of blood cholesterol.  However, this does not mean that cream should be consumed in high amounts. Cream is very rich in fat and calories, and may contribute to weight gain and obesity.  Being overweight is, in itself, a risk factor for heart disease and a variety of other chronic diseases.  Additionally, the results of the current study cannot be generalized. There are several reasons for this:   The participants consumed 40 grams of dairy fat per day, which is 10 grams higher than the national average in Sweden. Amounts higher than that may have adverse effects.   The study used whipping cream. Participants were not allowed to heat, mix or whip the cream. It is unclear what effects these preparation methods have on MFGMs.   The study used butter oil rather than butter. This is unlikely to be a limitation since the nutritional characteristics of these two products are very similar.   Bottom Line: Excessive consumption of cream may contribute to weight gain and obesity. However, low or moderate consumption is fine.  Summary and Real-Life Application  Not all high-fat dairy products have the same health effects.  Butter oil increases the levels of cholesterol in blood, whereas cream does not. This may be explained by MFGM, which surrounds the fat globules and counteracts the cholesterol-raising effects.  Simply put, cream appears to be healthier than butter because it contains MFGMs. How this affects hard endpoints, such as heart disease, remains to be seen.  Additionally, other studies on this topic have provided mixed results. Few have been conducted on specific dairy foods, so more research is needed before solid conclusions can be drawn.  That being said, no evidence justifies eating excessive amounts of cream. All high-fat dairy products should be eaten in moderation.  People with lipid problems or a family history of heart disease should probably minimize their consumption of butter. Extra virgin olive oil is a much better choice.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Oct 2nd – Oct 9th)  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 9, 2015  This is an overview of interesting scientific articles that have been published in the past week, from last Friday (Oct 2nd) until today (Oct 9th).   Research Reviews  This week, we reviewed two new articles from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  One was about how the body responds to a severe calorie deficit, and the other was about the effects of low-carb and high-carb diets on blood sugar control and heart disease risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes.  Monday  Link : Starvation Mode: When You Eat Less, Your Body Burns Less   Study : Muller et al. Metabolic Adaptation to Caloric Restriction and Subsequent Re-feeding: The Minnesota Starvation Experiment Revisited . American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2015.  Summary : This was a 6-week intervention study that examined the effects of severe calorie restriction on adaptive thermogenesis, also referred to as starvation mode.  The study found that adaptive thermogenesis kicks in shortly after calorie restriction starts. It appeared to have no significant effects on fat regain when the calorie restriction ended.   Wednesday  Link : Low-Carb vs High-Carb For Type 2 Diabetes  Study : Tay et al. Comparison of Low- and High-Carbohydrate Diets for Type 2 Diabetes Management: A Randomized Trial . American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2015.  Summary : This was a randomized trial that compared the effects of low-carb and high-carb diets on managing type 2 diabetes. The participants were overweight or obese, and were on a weight loss diet and an exercise program.  The main conclusion of the study was that low-carb diets can lead to greater improvements in blood sugar control and blood lipid profile, as opposed to high-carb diets. There was no difference in weight loss between groups.  Other New Research From Around the World  A lot of new research came out in the past week. New issues of both the International Journal of Obesity and the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition were published.  Here is an overview of the most interesting nutrition research published in the past week, categorized by subject.  Obesity and Weight Loss  Effect of weight loss on mortality in overweight and obese nursing home residents during a 5-year follow-up.  This long-term, observational study found that unintentional weight loss increased mortality in elderly, frail and disabled nursing home residents. This was regardless of whether they were overweight or obese. Unintentional weight loss is often a sign of underlying disease.   Prenatal exposure to systemic antibacterials and overweight and obesity in Danish schoolchildren: a prevalence study.  This observational study suggests that exposure to antibacterial medications before birth may increase the risk of school-aged children becoming overweight or obese.   Prenatal exposure to vitamin-D from fortified margarine and milk and body size at age 7 years.  Vitamin D deficiency before birth is possibly linked with increased risk of obesity later in life. However, this observational study indicates that the mother’s vitamin D intake is not linked to the child’s body size at age 7.   Diet quality across early childhood and adiposity at 6 years: the Southampton Women’s Survey.  This observational study found that low-quality diet in early childhood is associated with obesity by the age of 6. A low-quality diet was defined as a diet low in fish, fruit and vegetables.   Nighttime sleep duration and hedonic eating in childhood.  This observational study suggests that shorter sleep duration in children is associated with an increased preference for foods like fast food. This may explain the link between shorter sleep duration and childhood obesity.   Cardiovascular Health  Effect of whole soy and purified daidzein on ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial function—a 6-month double-blind, randomized controlled trial among Chinese postmenopausal women with prehypertension.  This double-blind, randomized controlled trial showed that consuming 40 g of soy flour or 63 g of daidzein (a soy isoflavone) per day had no significant effects on blood pressure in postmenopausal women. All of the women were equol-producing and had prehypertension or untreated hypertension.   Saturated fatty acids are not off the hook.   This review study argues that the association of saturated fat and cardiovascular disease is still unclear. It stresses the importance of analyzing individual saturated fatty acids rather than assuming they are all equal. Additionally, it indicates that increased intake of palmitic acid and stearic acid may raise cardiovascular disease risk.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Impact of preloading either dairy or soy milk on postprandial glycemia, insulinemia and gastric emptying in healthy adults.   This crossover trial found that drinking either dairy or soy milk with white bread (co-ingestion), or 30 minutes before (preloading), reduces the rise in blood sugar after meals. Preloading combined with co-ingestion had a greater effect than co-ingestion alone.   Brain Health and Function  Cognitive effects following acute wild blueberry supplementation in 7- to 10-year-old children.  This double-blind crossover study indicates that eating 15-30 g of freeze-dried wild blueberries may temporarily improve cognitive performance in children.   The effect of an acute ingestion of Turkish coffee on reaction time and time trial performance.  This double-blind, randomized crossover study found that drinking Turkish coffee temporarily improved reaction performance and feels of energy, compared to decaffeinated Turkish coffee. Additionally, it increased systolic blood pressure. The Turkish coffee contained 3 mg of caffeine per kg of body weight.   Fertility and Pregnancy  The association between maternal dietary intake and neonatal anthropometry – secondary analysis from the ROLO study.   Vitamins and minerals are absolutely essential for fetal growth. This observational study indicates that during the third trimester of pregnancy, birth weight is negatively associated with vitamin D intake, yet positively associated with vitamin B12 intake.   Folic acid supplementation and dietary folate intake, and risk of preeclampsia.   Pre-eclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by elevated blood pressure and high amounts of protein in the urine. This observational study suggests that pre-eclampsia is significantly less common among women who take folic acid supplements or get high amounts of folate in their diet.   Dental Health  Influence of fruit consumption and fluoride application on the prevalence of caries and erosion in vegetarians – a controlled clinical trial.   This observational study found that dental erosion and cavities were more common among vegetarians than meat-eaters. Higher fruit consumption and less use of fluoride-containing toothpaste among vegetarians may explain this.   Supplements  A pilot comparison of phospolipidated lutein to conventional lutein for effects on plasma lutein concentrations in adult people.  Lutein from conventional supplements is much more poorly absorbed than lutein from eggs, which are rich in phospholipids. This human trial found that taking lutein with phospholipids increased the blood levels of lutein much more than taking lutein alone.   Nutrients  Iron and the female athlete: a review of dietary treatment methods for improving iron status and exercise performance.  This review discusses the strategies for improving iron status in female athletes. Instead of taking iron supplements, studies suggest that dietary changes may be more effective.   Nocturnal eating disturbs phosphorus excretion in young subjects: a randomized crossover trial.  The time of day that eating occurs has been thought to impact phosphorus levels in blood. This crossover trial suggests that nighttime eating may increase phosphorus levels by blocking nighttime phosphorus excretion.   Plant Compounds  Quercetin reduces obesity-induced hepatosteatosis by enhancing mitochondrial oxidative metabolism via heme oxygenase-1.  This rat study suggests that a diet high in quercetin, a common plant compound, may protect against obesity-related fatty liver.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Low-Carb vs High-Carb For Type 2 Diabetes  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 7, 2015  Type 2 diabetes is a common condition characterized by high levels of blood sugar, usually due to insulin resistance .  The treatment of type 2 diabetes involves medication, but lifestyle strategies are very important as well.  These include increased exercise, weight loss and diet management ( 1 ).  Although low-carb diets have become popular for managing type 2 diabetes, few high-quality studies have investigated their long-term effects on blood sugar control and risk factors for heart disease ( 2 ).   Article Reviewed  A team of Australian researchers set out to compare the long-term health effects of a low-carb diet and a high-carb diet, focusing on differences in blood sugar control and risk factors for heart disease.  Tay et al. Comparison of Low- and High-Carbohydrate Diets for Type 2 Diabetes Management: A Randomized Trial . American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2015.  Study Design  This was a randomized trial that spanned one year, or 52 weeks total.  A total of 115 obese and overweight adults with type 2 diabetes participated. Their age ranged from 35 to 68 years.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two diets that contained an equal amount of calories:   Low-carb diet (LC): Carbs, protein and fat comprised 14%, 28% and 58% of calories, respectively. The total carb content was under 50 grams per day.   High-carb diet (HC): Carbs, protein and fat comprised 53%, 17% and 30% of calories, respectively.   Both diets restricted calories in order to produce weight loss. Calories were restricted by 30%, which amounted to 500â1000 calories, depending on the individual.  The fat content of the diets was mainly unsaturated, with less than 10% of calories from saturated fats.  In addition, all participants had 60-minute, supervised exercise sessions three times per week. These sessions focused on moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise.  Blood samples were taken at the beginning, in the middle (24 weeks), and at the end (52 weeks) of the study.  Results  78 people completed the study, which is 68% of participants.  Due to regular exercise and the reduction of calories, participants in both groups lost weight and achieved significant health improvements.  This graph shows the weight changes in the two groups:   Changes in the following health markers were similar between groups:   Weight loss : The LC group lost 9.8 kg (21.6 lbs) and the HC group lost 10.1 kg (22.3 lbs).   HbA1c : Levels dropped by 1% in both groups.   Fasting blood sugar: Decreased by 0.7 mmol/L (27.02 mg/dL) in the LC group and 1.5 mmol/L (57.9 mg/dL) in the HC group.   LDL cholesterol: Levels dropped by 0.1 mmol/L (3.9 mg/dL) in the LC group and 0.2 mmol/L (7.7 mg/dL) in the HC group.   Blood pressure: Fell by 7.1 mmHg in the LC group and 5.8 mmHg in the HC group.   Inflammation: Estimated by the C-reactive protein, this decreased by 0.9 mg/L in the LC group and 1.2 mg/L in the HC group.   Insulin resistance: Also decreased substantially.   However, the low-carb group experienced significantly greater improvements in several health markers.  These included improvements in the following:   Medication: Greater reduction in the need for diabetes medication.   Glycemic variability: At least twice the decrease in glycemic variability, indicating greater stability in blood sugar levels.   Hyperglycemia: Less risk of experiencing high blood sugar levels.   Triglycerides: 0.4 mmol/L (7.2 mg/dl) reduction in triglycerides, versus a 0.01 mmol/L (0.18 mg/dl) reduction in the HC group.   HDL cholesterol: Increases of 0.1 mmol/L (1.8 mg/dl), versus 0.06 mmol/L (1.08 mg/dl) in the HC group.   Main Conclusions  For overweight or obese people with type 2 diabetes, calorie-restricted diets and regular exercise lead to weight loss, improved blood sugar control and reduced risk factors for heart disease.  This happens regardless of whether people follow low-carb or high-carb diets.  However, low-carb diets lead to greater improvements in blood sugar control and blood lipid profile than high-carb diets.  Additionally, low-carb diets decrease the need for diabetes medication and help stabilize blood sugar levels.  For this reason, low-carb diets can help effectively manage type 2 diabetes.  Limitations  This study was well designed, but had a few limitations.   It did not include a control group of participants who did not change their diet, which would have helped isolate the effects of the lifestyle modifications.   The assignment to diets was not blind.   The LC group’s protein intake was much higher. Protein can affect weight loss as well as glycemic control, so this may have impacted the results of the study.   By the end of the study, the LC group had increased their carbohydrate intake to 74 g, and saturated fat accounted for 11% of calories. Calorie intake was increased throughout the study in both groups.   Adherence to the diet was good but not perfect, which is a common limitation of these types of studies.    What Do Other Studies Say?  HbA1c  The main outcome variable of the current study was HbA1c.  HbA1c is also known as glycated hemoglobin. Measuring HbA1c gives clinicians and scientists an idea of the average blood sugar levels over the previous few months.  High HbA1c levels are associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes-related complications.  Some studies have found no significant differences in the effects of low- and high-carb diets on HbA1c ( 3 , 4 ).  Conversely, other studies have reported greater reductions in HbA1c with LC diets ( 5 , 6 , 7 ).  Weight Loss  Studies that have compared LC diets with calorie-restricted HC diets among patients with type 2 diabetes have provided mixed results.  Some reported that LC diets caused greater weight loss ( 2 , 7 ).  In the current study, both diets contained the same amount of calories, and weight loss was similar.  This suggests that the main cause of weight loss is calorie deficit rather than the nutrient composition of the diets. Several previous studies support this ( 3 , 4 , 8 , 9 ).  Blood Lipids  Supporting the present study, one 24-week randomized controlled trial in obese adults with type 2 diabetes showed that a LC diet caused greater improvements in blood sugar control and blood lipid profile than a HC diet ( 10 ).  Similarly, previous studies have reported greater reductions in triglycerides and higher increases in HDL-cholesterol with LC diets ( 11 , 12 ).  In the current study, similar reductions in LDL-cholesterol were seen in both the LC and HC diets.  In contrast, large reviews of previous trials suggest that very LC diets may have less favorable effects on LDL cholesterol than conventional high-carb, low-fat diets ( 13 , 14 ).  These differences may be explained by the type of fat replacing carbs in LC diets. In the present study, carbs were replaced with unsaturated fat, which may lower LDL-cholesterol.  Conversely, saturated fats may raise the levels of LDL-cholesterol ( 15 , 16 , 17 ).  Summary and Real-Life Application  In conclusion, reducing calories and increasing exercise can lead to weight loss and improved health — regardless of whether people are on a low-carb or high-carb diet.  However, for obese people who have type 2 diabetes, a low-carb diet seems to be more effective at improving blood sugar control and reducing the risk factors for heart disease.  This is supported by several studies showing that low-carb diets are effective for diabetics.  Tags: Diabetes , Low-carb diets , Low-fat diets

	Starvation Mode: When You Eat Less, Your Body Burns Less  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  October 5, 2015  Besides storing fat, the body has several methods to survive periods of food shortage and starvation.  One of them is called adaptive thermogenesis, sometimes referred to as “ starvation mode. ”  It involves a reduction in the amount of calories your body burns, resulting in slower weight loss and faster weight regain.  It is defined as a decrease in resting energy expenditure during calorie restriction, beyond what can be explained by reduced mass of muscles, organs and fat.  Adaptive thermogenesis is seen when people continuously restrict calories by dieting and/or exercising. It may also be caused by weight loss drugs or surgery ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Although adaptive thermogenesis is well-known, how it works remains unclear.   Article Reviewed  German researchers set out to investigate the causes and dynamics of adaptive thermogenesis ( starvation mode ).  They wanted to find out how body composition affects adaptive thermogenesis, whether it causes changes in hormones, and what effect it has on weight regain.  Muller et al. Metabolic Adaptation to Caloric Restriction and Subsequent Re-feeding: The Minnesota Starvation Experiment Revisited . American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2015.   Study Design  The article describes the results of two related studies from Christian Albrechts University, in Germany.  The design was similar to the famous Minnesota Starvation Experiment from 1950, one of the most important early studies on the effects of starvation in humans ( 4 ).  Study 1  This 6-week intervention study included 32 healthy, non-obese men, between 20 and 37 years of age.  Before the intervention started, participants spent 10 weeks at the university’s metabolic ward where their energy needs were calculated.  The intervention was divided into three parts:   Overfeeding: For one week, the participants were overfed so that their calorie intake exceeded their energy needs by 50%.   Calorie restriction: For three weeks, the participants were semi-starved so that their calorie intake was 50% lower than their energy needs.   Re-feeding: For two weeks, the participants were again overfed so that their calorie intake exceeded their needs by 50%.   All participants spent every day, from 8 AM to 6 PM, at the university’s metabolic ward, where they were measured and monitored.  Dietary intake was strictly controlled. All foods were weighed and all meals supervised.  Additionally, participants were encouraged to avoid any physical activity and to remain sedentary.  Compliance was ensured by using continuous 24-h glucose monitors, pedometers and dietary records.  Body composition was measured using various techniques. These included quantitative magnetic resonance and whole-body MRI.  The levels of various hormones and other relevant body processes were also analyzed throughout the study.  Study 2  A smaller follow-up study was done 1.5 years later than the original study.  This study included only eight of the participants that took part in the first study.  Its purpose was to estimate the effects of short-term calorie restriction on adaptive thermogenesis.  Additionally, it examined whether the results of the earlier study were reproducible.  It was divided into two parts:   Overfeeding : Participants were overfed for one week.   Calorie restriction : Participants were calorie restricted for one week.   Otherwise, the methods were similar to the first study.  Results  This chart below shows the changes in body composition over the course of the study (click to enlarge):   The top graph shows change in body weight, the middle graph shows a change in fat mass, and the bottom graph shows nitrogen balance, which indicates changes in lean mass (mostly muscles and organs).  After three weeks of calorie restriction, body weight decreased by 6 kg (13.2 lbs – 7.5%) and resting energy expenditure dropped by 266 calories per day, on average.  Adaptive thermogenesis was detected in 60% of participants in the early stages of calorie restriction. It became significant on the third day.  It was partly responsible for the decrease in energy expenditure, accounting for 108 calories/day.  Of these 108 calories per day, 36 were explained by changes in the composition of fat-free mass, leaving 72 calories for “true” adaptive thermogenesis.  Factors that were associated with adaptive thermogenesis included reduced insulin levels, heart rate, kidney function and body fluid balance. Increased formation of glucose in the liver also appeared to play a role.  Adaptive thermogenesis was not associated with changes in sympathetic nervous system activity, total body fat, belly fat, liver fat, organ mass, nitrogen and sodium balances.  It was also not linked to hormonal changes, such as in leptin , ghrelin, adiponectin and thyroid hormone levels (T3).  Lastly, adaptive thermogenesis appears to have no long-term effects on weight or fat regain after short-term calorie restriction. The effect was reversed within two weeks of re-feeding.  Here you can see how energy expenditure changes from adaptive thermogenesis developed during the course of the study:   As you can see, the increase during the re-feeding phase completely reversed the decrease seen during the calorie restriction phase.  Several other parameters changed significantly during 3 weeks of severe calorie restriction:   Fat mass: Decreased by 114 grams per day.  Lean mass: Decreased by 159 grams per day (muscles and organs combined, see below).  Muscle mass: Decreased by 5%.  Liver mass: Decreased by 13%.  Kidney mass: Decreased by 8%.  Heart rate: Went down by 14%.  Blood pressure: Went down by 7%.  Creatinine clearance: Went down by 12%.  Energy cost of walking: Decreased by 22%.  Sympathetic nervous system activity: Decreased by 38%.  Leptin levels: Decreased by 44%.  Insulin levels: Decreased by 54%.  Adiponectin levels: Decreased by 49%.  Triiodothyronine (T3): Decreased by 39%.  Testosterone: Decreased by 11%.   Main Conclusions  The main conclusions of the study were as follows:   Adaptive thermogenesis is modest and kicks in during the early stages of starvation, shortly after calorie restriction starts. It is maintained as long as you keep restricting calories.   Adaptive thermogenesis appears to have no long-term effects on weight or fat regain after short-term calorie restriction.   Adaptive thermogenesis was partially explained by reductions in heart rate and kidney function, and increased formation of glucose in the liver.   In early calorie restriction, adaptive thermogenesis is also associated with a drop in insulin levels.   Limitations  The study has no apparent limitations. It was tightly controlled and had highly significant results.  However, since the participants were limited to healthy, sedentary, non-obese men, the results may not be generalized to all people.  For example, it is possible that the dynamics of of adaptive thermogenesis are vastly different in people with obesity.  What Do Other Studies Say?  In general, adaptive thermogenesis (AT) is considered to be an automatic response to food shortage.  In the Minnesota Starvation Experiment from 1950, resting energy expenditure declined by 39% (600 calories/day). About 35% of this decline was not caused by changes in body composition, which indicates that AT also played a role ( 4 ).  Additionally, studies in obese patients have detected adaptive thermogenesis amounting to 504 calories/day ( 5 , 6 ).  Reduced levels of leptin and thyroid hormone (T3) have often been considered as major determinants of AT ( 7 , 8 , 9 ).  Although the current study showed reductions in both leptin and T3, it did not support a causal relationship between AT and changes in these hormones.  This is supported by studies on obese patients after weight loss. They found no significant associations between AT and reductions in leptin and T3 ( 5 , 6 ).  Some studies indicate that AT may contribute to increased weight regain after calorie restriction ( 4 , 10 ).  This effect has been referred to as the “fat overshooting” phenomenon ( 7 ).  According to the current study, this effect is reversed within 2 weeks of re-feeding.  Summary and Real-Life Application  In short, adaptive thermogenesis (AT) is one of the main reasons your body starts burning fewer calories when you lose weight.  It is a part of the reason why weight loss tends to slow down over time, and is often referred to as “starvation mode.”  In the current study, significant adaptive thermogenesis was detected as early as on the third day of calorie restriction.  Unfortunately, there is no known way to completely prevent this from happening.  However, two effective ways to partly reduce muscle loss and metabolic slowdown during weight loss include strength training and keeping your protein intake high ( 10 , 11 , 12 ).  Additionally, by exercising more and staying active throughout the day, you can negate some of the reduction in energy expenditure.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Sep 25th – Oct 2nd)  By Kris Gunnars, BSc  |  October 2, 2015  This is an overview of everything new and interesting that happened in nutrition science in the past week, from last Friday (Sep 25th) until today (Oct 2nd).   Research Review  This week, we reviewed two new studies. One was on the effects of saturated fat from meat and cheese on blood lipids, while the other was about the effects of different fruits and vegetables on weight change.  Monday  Link:  Effects of Saturated Fat From Meat and Cheese on Blood Lipids  Study: Thorning et al. Diets With High-Fat Cheese, High-Fat Meat, or Carbohydrate on Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Overweight Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Crossover Trial. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2015.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial looked at the effects of saturated fat from high-meat and high-cheese diets on blood lipids and lipoproteins. The control group followed a low-fat, high-carb diet.  In this study, the high saturated fat diets had very little effects, except that they increased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein-A1, the lipoprotein that carries HDL cholesterol in the blood.   Wednesday  Link:  Do All Fruits and Vegetables Help You Lose Weight?  Study: Bertoia et al. Changes in Intake of Fruits and Vegetables and Weight Change in United States Men and Women Followed for Up to 24 Years: Analysis from Three Prospective Cohort Studies. PLOS Medicine 2015.  Summary: This paper analyzed data from 3 observational studies with a total of 133,468 people. It looked at changes in intake of specific fruits and vegetables and effects on body weight.  They found that all fruits were associated with weight loss, especially berries. Vegetables were also associated with weight loss, except for starchy vegetables like potatoes, corn and peas – which were associated with weight gain.  Vegetables that were both high in fiber and had a low glycemic load (GL) were more strongly associated with weight loss over time.  New Studies From Around The Web  A ton of interesting studies were published in the past week, with new releases from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , Journal of Nutrition and British Journal of Nutrition .  Here is an overview of the most interesting studies, organized by category.  Obesity and Weight Loss  Frequent Self-Weighing with Electronic Graphic Feedback to Prevent Age-Related Weight Gain in Young Adults.  This randomized controlled trial showed that weighing oneself every day with Wi-Fi scales and receiving graphic feedback via e-mail prevented age-related weight gain in young college students. The intervention group lost 0.5 kg (1.1 lb), while the control group gained 1.1 kg (2.4 lbs) over 1 year.   Sympathetic Neuro-adipose Connections Mediate Leptin-Driven Lipolysis.  This study suggests that the lipolytic (fat-burning) effects of the hormone leptin are mediated by sympathetic nerves in fat tissue.   The Human Circadian System Has a Dominating Role in Causing the Morning/Evening Difference in Diet-Induced Thermogenesis.  This randomized crossover study showed that diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) was 44% lower in the evening compared to morning, which was mediated by the circadian system (the body’s internal clock). Eating food in the evening or at night may cause weight gain compared to eating it in the morning, when DIT is higher.   Metabolic adaptation to caloric restriction and subsequent refeeding: the Minnesota Starvation Experiment revisited.  This was an analysis from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment looking at metabolic adaptation to severe calorie restriction and subsequent refeeding. We will be reviewing this study in detail next week.   Examination of central body fat deposition as a risk factor for loss-of-control eating.  This study found that increased body fat in the abdominal cavity (visceral fat) was linked to increased body dissatisfaction and increased risk of loss-of-control eating. Depositing body fat “centrally” may raise the risk of eating disorders.   Breakfasts Higher in Protein Increase Postprandial Energy Expenditure, Increase Fat Oxidation, and Reduce Hunger in Overweight Children from 8 to 12 Years of Age.  This randomized crossover study found that a high-protein breakfast increased metabolism and fat burning and reduced hunger in both normal weight and overweight children.   Elevated BMI and Male Sex Are Associated with Greater Underreporting of Caloric Intake as Assessed by Doubly Labeled Water.  This study found that males, and those with a higher BMI, under-reported their calorie intake to a greater extent.   Cardiovascular Health  Longitudinal association of dairy consumption with the changes in blood pressure and the risk of incident hypertension: the Framingham Heart Study.  This analysis from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort found that yogurt intake was associated with reduced risk of developing high blood pressure. It also found that total dairy intake and total low-fat/fat-free dairy intake were linked to decreased diastolic blood pressure.   The Effect of a Dietary Portfolio Compared to a DASH-Type Diet on Blood Pressure.  This 24-week randomized controlled trial found that a cholesterol-lowering diet with soy protein, viscous fiber and nuts caused slightly greater reductions in blood pressure than a DASH-type diet.   Effect of improving dietary quality on carotid intima media thickness in subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a 12-mo randomized controlled trial.  This 12-month randomized controlled trial found that recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable intake slowed the progression of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.   Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and incident hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohorts.  This meta-analysis of 6 observational studies found that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages was linked to a 12% greater risk of developing high blood pressure. Each single serving per day was linked to an 8.2% greater risk.   Higher Plasma Phospholipid n–3 PUFAs, but Lower n–6 PUFAs, Are Associated with Lower Pulse Wave Velocity among Older Adults.  This observational study found that higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids in the blood were linked to increased stiffness of arteries, while levels of omega-3 fatty acids were linked to decreased stiffness.   Insulin Resistance and Metabolic Syndrome  Paleolithic nutrition for metabolic syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that a paleolithic diet caused greater short-term improvements in symptoms of metabolic syndrome compared to standard nutrition guidelines.   Type and amount of dietary protein in the treatment of metabolic syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial compared modified DASH diets high in either animal or plant protein in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. Both diets were effective and there was no difference between plant or animal protein.   Consumption of Yogurt, Low-Fat Milk, and Other Low-Fat Dairy Products Is Associated with Lower Risk of Metabolic Syndrome Incidence in an Elderly Mediterranean Population.  This analysis from the PREDIMED study found that low-fat dairy, low-fat yogurt, low-fat milk and whole-fat yogurt were linked to decreased risk of metabolic syndrome. However, cheese was linked to increased risk.   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Comparison of low- and high-carbohydrate diets for type 2 diabetes management: a randomized trial.  This 52-week randomized controlled trial in 115 obese individuals with type 2 diabetes compared calorie-restricted low-carb and high-carb diets. Both diets caused weight loss and improved blood sugar control. The low-carb diet had greater effects on blood lipids, blood sugar stability and caused a greater reduction in diabetes medication requirements.   A single serving of caffeinated coffee impairs postprandial glucose metabolism in overweight men.  This study found that a single serving of caffeinated coffee raised blood sugar levels in overweight men.   Cancer  Dietary fiber intake and risk of colorectal cancer and incident and recurrent adenoma in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.  This observational study did not find a statistically significant reduction in colorectal cancer based on total fiber intake. However, it did find a reduction in distal colorectal cancer risk and incident colorectal adenoma.   Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons of metabolic profiles between vegetarian and non-vegetarian subjects: a matched cohort study.  This observational study found that lacto-ovo vegetarians, lacto-vegetarians and vegans had reduced obesity, blood pressure and blood sugar compared to non-vegetarians. However, the vegetarians and vegans had lower HDL levels.   Foods and Food Groups  Consumption of Honey, Sucrose, and High-Fructose Corn Syrup Produces Similar Metabolic Effects in Glucose-Tolerant and -Intolerant Individuals.  This randomized crossover trial found that 50 grams of honey, sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup for 14 days had similar effects on inflammation, blood sugar control and blood lipids. All 3 increased blood triglycerides, but only increased blood sugar and inflammatory markers in individuals with insulin resistance.   Efficacy of fish intake on vitamin D status: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that fish (especially fatty fish) increased blood levels of vitamin D. On average, increased fish intake increased blood levels by 4.4 nmol/mL, but reached 8.3 nmol/L in the longer-term studies.   Systematic review of the effect of processing of whole-grain oat cereals on glycaemic response.  This systematic review compared different types of whole-grain oats cereals and their effects on blood sugar levels. Steel-cut oats, large-flake oats, muesli and granola had much smaller effects on blood sugar levels than than quick-cooking oats and instant oatmeal.   Impact of palm date consumption on microbiota growth and large intestinal health: a randomised, controlled, cross-over, human intervention study.  This study found that palm dates did not change levels of gut bacteria. However, the dates did increase bowel movements and stool frequency and reduced fecal genotoxicity, which may indicate reduced risk of colon cancer.   Supplements  Does vitamin-D intake during resistance training improve the skeletal muscle hypertrophic and strength response in young and elderly men? – a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle hypertrophy or muscle strength over 12 weeks in young or elderly individuals. However, there was some difference in muscle quality in elderly and fiber type morphology in young individuals.   Effects of intraduodenal infusion of the branched-chain amino acid leucine on ad libitum eating, gut motor and hormone functions, and glycemia in healthy men.  Infusing the amino acid leucine into the duodenum of lean men reduced calorie intake by 13%, increased blood levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) and reduced blood sugar and insulin levels.   The effect of melatonin treatment on postural stability, muscle strength, and quality of life and sleep in postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial found that melatonin supplementation for 12 months had no effects on postural balance, risk of falls, muscle strength, quality of life or sleep in postmenopausal women. However, there was a non-significant trend towards improved sleep in women who had sleep disturbances at the beginning of the study.   Effects of a quercetin-rich onion skin extract on 24 h ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial function in overweight-to-obese patients with (pre-)hypertension: a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over trial.  This randomized controlled trial found that quercetin from onion skin slightly reduced systolic blood pressure (-3.6 mmHg) in individuals with high blood pressure, but not in individuals with normal blood pressure.   Cocoa flavanol intake improves endothelial function and Framingham Risk Score in healthy men and women: a randomised, controlled, double-masked trial: the Flaviola Health Study.  This study found that cocoa flavanols significantly improved endothelial function. They also lowered blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, while increasing HDL cholesterol.   Vitamin E function and requirements in relation to PUFA.  A review that discusses how vitamin E requirements may be increased when people increase their intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids.   Muscle Building  Role of insulin in the regulation of human skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This is a review of the effects of the hormone insulin on skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown.   Differences in postprandial protein handling after beef compared with milk ingestion during postexercise recovery: a randomized controlled trial.  This crossover randomized controlled trial of 12 young men found that dairy protein had a greater effect on muscle protein synthesis in the 0-2 hour post-exercise phase, but there was no net difference over the 0-5 hour post-exercise phase.   Collagen peptide supplementation in combination with resistance training improves body composition and increases muscle strength in elderly sarcopenic men: a randomised controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial found that supplementing with collagen peptides improved body composition and increased muscle strength in elderly men with sarcopenia, when combined with resistance training.   Fertility and Pregnancy  Association between serum folate and vitamin B-12 and outcomes of assisted reproductive technologies.  Women with high blood levels of folate and vitamin B12 had much higher (62% and 104%, respectively) rates of successful live births using assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment.   Maternal prepregnancy obesity and cause-specific stillbirth.  This study found that overweight, obese and severely obese women had 40%, 80% and 100% greater risk of stillbirth, respectively, compared to lean women.   Aging and Longevity  Dietary inflammatory index and telomere length in subjects with a high cardiovascular disease risk from the PREDIMED-NAVARRA study: cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses over 5 y.  This study found that a diet with a high dietary inflammation index (DII) was associated with a shortening of telomeres. This indicates that an inflammatory diet can accelerate aging, and that an anti-inflammatory diet may slow aging.  Tags: Weekly recap

	Do All Fruits and Vegetables Help You Lose Weight?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 30, 2015  Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables has been associated with improved health and a reduced risk of chronic disease.  The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans even recommend them for weight loss.  However, not all fruits and vegetables are equal when it comes to weight loss or maintenance. They may have different metabolic effects, depending on their nutrient composition.  Body weight may be affected by glycemic load and amount of fiber, as well as polyphenols and sugar content ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ).   Study Reviewed  A team of researchers hypothesized that fruits and vegetables with a high fiber content or a low glycemic load would be more strongly associated with weight loss.  To prove or disprove this hypothesis, they did a meta-analysis of three observational studies that spanned up to 24 years.  Bertoia et al. Changes in Intake of Fruits and Vegetables and Weight Change in United States Men and Women Followed for Up to 24 Years: Analysis from Three Prospective Cohort Studies . PLOS Medicine 2015.  Aims  The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of increased fruit and vegetable intake and changes in weight over time.  Additionally, the researchers wanted to find out if fiber-rich, low-glycemic fruits and vegetables were more strongly associated with weight loss and weight maintenance than their fiber-poor and high-glycemic counterparts.  Study Design  The study combined data from three large observational studies, using a method known as random effects meta-analysis.  These three observational studies were the Nurses’ Health Study, the Nurses’ Health Study II, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.  They included a total of 133,468 health professionals from the US, and spanned 24 years, from 1986 to 2010.  With 4-year intervals, dietary and lifestyle habits were estimated using questionnaires. Similarly, body weight was self-reported.  The study used a so-called “change-on-change” analysis. In other words, it examined the effect of changes in the consumption fruit and vegetables and compared them with changes in body weight.  A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess food intake. It included more than 70 fruits and vegetables ( 5 ).  The foods were classified as either high- or low-fiber, and as high- or low-glycemic, based on their glycemic load. Glycemic load was calculated by multiplying the serving size with the glycemic index of the food.  When analyzing the dietary data, other lifestyle factors and diseases were taken into account. These included other dietary aspects, physical activity, alcohol and smoking status.  Additionally, the calculations were only based on whole foods. Processed foods, such as fruit juice , french fries and potato chips, were excluded.  Results  This chart shows the weight loss for different classes of fruits and vegetables, based on one serving size:   The numbers show the pooled weight loss over four years, for each serving. As you can see, eating berries was most strongly associated with weight loss.  Several individual fruits and vegetables were also associated with weight loss. These included apples , pears , blueberries, raisins, grapes, prunes, grapefruit, soy , tofu, cauliflower, peppers and carrots .  In contrast, a few starchy vegetables appeared to promote weight gain.   As you can see, potatoes , corn and peas were all associated with weight gain in the current study.  However, this only applied to servings that exceeded one serving per day.  Overall, these results indicate that eating fruits and (most) vegetables may help with weight loss and weight maintenance.  On the other hand, starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, peas and corn, may promote weight gain when eaten in excess.  All of these effects were stronger among overweight individuals than normal-weight individuals.  Fruits — Effect of Fiber and Glycemic Load  When fruits were examined, no association with weight change was found for fiber content or glycemic load.  Vegetables — Effect of Fiber and Glycemic Load  Low-fiber vegetables were associated with weight loss. Similarly, high-fiber vegetables were linked to weight loss, but only when potatoes were excluded.  Additionally, eating more than one serving of low-GL vegetables per day was linked to weight loss, but the significance was only marginal.  The results changed when high-fiber and low-GL vegetables were grouped together and compared with low-fiber, high-GL vegetables.  The difference was highly significant. High-fiber and low-GL vegetables were clearly better at promoting weight loss.  Main Conclusions   Increased vegetable and fruit consumption is linked to weight loss over time, especially among overweight individuals.   Fruits, especially berries, are more effective at promoting weight loss than vegetables.   Starchy, high-glycemic vegetables, such as potatoes, corn and peas, are associated with weight gain.   Limitations  This was an observational study (as opposed to a randomized controlled trial), and observational studies have many potential limitations.  They only provide hints, indicating a possible causal relationship, but cannot prove anything.  Even though the study showed strong associations, their cause remains unclear.  Additionally, the interpretation of observational studies is often difficult due to a type of bias known as confounding.  This means that factors, other than those that are being investigated, may be responsible for the observed relationship.  These factors are called confounders. In this study, the most important confounders — physical activity, smoking, and foods — were taken into account.  There are several other potential limitations.   The study used a validated food frequency questionnaire to estimate food intake ( 5 ). These questionnaires are prone to errors that may reduce the chance of finding significant associations.   It is possible that those individuals who were eating more fruit and vegetables for health reasons were also making other healthy lifestyle changes that were not completely captured by the study’s questionnaires.   Since the study mainly included white adults with graduate degrees, the results may not be generalizable to all people. However, the effects are unlikely to be different in other populations.   That being said, this study appears to be about as good as observational studies get.  What Do Other Studies Say?  Supporting the current study, other observational studies have found that increased fruit and vegetable intake is linked to weight loss ( 1 , 6 , 7 , 8 ).  One observational study found a similar association that only applied to fruit, but not vegetables ( 9 ).  In contrast, another observational study did not detect any significant association of fruit and vegetable intake and weight change. However, it did not do a change-on-change analysis like the current study ( 10 ).  Clinical trials have also provided mixed results.  In 103 overweight individuals with sleep-related eating disorders, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables caused weight loss over 3 months ( 11 ).  Conversely, increasing vegetable and fruit intake did not have any significant effects on weight in 690 healthy individuals over a 6-month period ( 12 ).  Trials that have focused on eating specific fruits and vegetables support that some of them may benefit weight loss. Among these are apples, pears and grapefruit ( 13 , 14 ).  Summary and Real-Life Application  Overall, the findings of the study support the dietary recommendations of eating fruits and vegetables for healthy weight.  However, not all vegetables are made equal.  The study indicates that excessive consumption of certain starchy vegetables may promote weight gain. These include potatoes, peas and corn.  In short, if you are overweight, consider eating more whole fruit and vegetables, but limit your intake of starchy vegetables.  Tags: Fruit , Vegetables , Weight loss

	Effects of Saturated Fat From Meat and Cheese on Blood Lipids  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 28, 2015  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in many countries, and high saturated fat intake has long been thought to be a major risk factor.  For this reason, health authorities have recommended limiting the intake of foods rich in saturated fat, such as meat and high-fat cheese.  However, studies indicate that high-fat cheese may actually protect against heart disease ( 1 , 2 , 3 ).  Additionally, several recent meta-analyses have been unable to find a link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease ( 4 , 5 ). However, there may be a small reduction in cardiovascular “events” when replaced with polyunsaturated fat ( 6 ).   Study Reviewed  This randomized crossover trial examined how saturated fat from meat and cheese affected blood lipids.  Thorning et al. Diets With High-Fat Cheese, High-Fat Meat, or Carbohydrate on Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Overweight Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Crossover Trial . American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2015 .  Aim  This study compared the effects of saturated animal fats and carbohydrates on blood lipids, apolipoproteins and fat digestibility.  Study Design  This 10-week study was a randomized crossover trial. A total of 19 postmenopausal women were recruited to participate.  Each participant’s energy requirements were calculated. Based on that, they were placed on a weight-maintenance diet to prevent weight changes during the study period.  The participants were then randomly assigned to one of three diets, each of which lasted for two weeks.   High-cheese diet: This diet focused on cheese, but no other dairy products were included.   High-meat diet: Participants on this diet were fed beef and pork, but no dairy products.   Control diet: The control diet contained high amounts of carbs and low amounts of fat, as well as protein from lean meat. The carbs mainly consisted of fruit, white bread, pasta, marmalade, rice, cakes, biscuits and chocolate.   These three groups were isocaloric, meaning they had an equal energy content. In the high-cheese and high-meat groups, the percentage of energy provided was:   Protein: 15%.  Fat: 35% (13% from saturated fat).  Carbs: 50%.   In the control diet, the percentage of energy provided was approximately:   Protein: 15%.  Fat: 25%.  Carbs: 60%.   All three diets contained similar amounts of protein. The only difference was the source of fat — from cheese or meat — and the amount of fat, which differed between the high-fat/high-meat diets and the control diet.  Since this was a crossover trial, all participants received each of the test foods at different points during the study. However, the order in which they got the foods was randomized.  Additionally, due to the nature of the diets, it was impossible to blind the participants.  Each of the study cycles was separated by a 2-week period, to stabilize blood lipids between diets.  At the beginning and end of each study period, blood samples were taken after a 12-hour fast. Fat digestibility was estimated by measuring fat in stools.  Results  A total of 5 participants dropped out during the study period, and 14 completed it.  Compared to the control diet, both the high-cheese and high-meat diets increased levels of the “good” HDL-cholesterol by 5% and 8%, respectively.  Apolipoprotein A-1 levels also increased by 8% and 4%, respectively. Apolipoprotein A-1 is the protein that carries HDL cholesterol in the blood, and having higher levels is a good thing.  In the high-cheese diet, the ratio of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-1 also went down by 5%, which indicates reduced heart disease risk.  Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides remained similar between groups.  Additionally, the fat in cheese did not seem to be efficiently absorbed.  Main Conclusions  The saturated fat in meat and cheese did not have adverse effects on blood lipids, compared to a high-carb, low-fat diet.  The study also found that some of the fat in cheese is not digested, and passes out of the body with feces.  Limitations  This study was well-designed and does not have any apparent shortcomings.  However, it has several limitations.   There were only 14 participants that completed the study.   The duration of the study was short.   The participant group was very specific — postmenopausal women.   Macronutrients were closely matched between diets, so the study does not provide a direct comparison of either cheese or meat as a whole.   There was not a direct comparison of the different saturated fats found in cheese and meat. However, isolating these fats would neglect the potential interaction of the different nutrients in whole foods.   What Do Other Studies Say?  A high-fat diet rich in dairy calcium significantly decreased LDL-cholesterol, compared to a low-calcium diet ( 7 ).  Contrasting the results of the current study, other studies have shown a reduction in HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 when saturated fat has been replaced with carbs ( 8 , 9 ).  Supporting the results, a few observational studies have found a positive association between cheese intake and levels of HDL-cholesterol and apo A-1 ( 10 , 11 ).  Summary and Real Life Application  For some time, health authorities have been recommending low-fat diets, saying that saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease.  However, the findings of this study (and many others) contradict those sources.  At the end of the day, saturated fat isn’t the demon it has been made out to be.  There is no reason to avoid saturated fat from whole foods, but there is no reason to glorify it and eat much of it either. It is neither good or bad, just neutral.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Sep 18th – Sep 25th)  By Kris Gunnars, BSc  |  September 25, 2015  This is an overview of everything new and interesting that happened in nutrition science in the past week, from last Friday (Sep 18th) until today (Sep 25th).   Research Review  This week, we reviewed two studies. One on breakfast and weight loss, the other on a Mediterranean diet and breast cancer.  Monday  Link:  Does Eating or Skipping Breakfast Affect Weight Loss?  Study: Dhurandhar et al. The effectiveness of breakfast recommendations on weight loss: a randomized controlled trial. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2014.  Summary: This was a study published in 2014, the largest randomized controlled trial ever done on breakfast recommendations and weight loss.  This study showed that telling people to either eat or skip breakfast has no statistically significant effects on body weight. This indicates that it doesn’t really matter whether people who are trying to lose weight eat breakfast or not.   Wednesday  Link:  Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil Slashes Breast Cancer Risk by 62%  Study: Estefania Toledo, et al. Mediterranean Diet and Invasive Breast Cancer Risk Among Women at High Cardiovascular Risk in the PREDIMED Trial. JAMA Internal Medicine, 2015.  Summary: This was a paper from the PREDIMED study, showing that a Mediterranean diet with extra virgin olive oil reduced breast cancer risk by 62%.  This study also showed that those who consumed the most extra virgin olive oil had by far the lowest risk of breast cancer, indicating that extra virgin olive oil is protective.  Given that breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, this is a major finding.  The study did find a trend towards reduced breast cancer in a group that followed a Mediterranean diet with nuts, but it was not statistically significant.  Other Studies From Around The Web  Many interesting studies were published in the past week, with new editions from the British Journal of Nutrition and Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases .

	Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil Slashes Breast Cancer Risk by 62%  By Kris Gunnars, BSc  |  September 23, 2015  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. About 12.3% of women will experience breast cancer at some point in their life ( 1 ).  Even though modern medical treatments work well in many cases, it still causes about half a million deaths per year.  Breast cancer has become increasingly more common in the past few decades, which may be attributed to our modern lifestyles ( 2 ).  Several observational studies have suggested that a “Mediterranean” diet pattern may reduce the risk of breast cancer ( 3 , 4 ), although other observational studies have found no effects ( 5 , 6 ).   Study Reviewed  Today’s study is the first randomized controlled trial that looks at the effect of the Mediterranean diet on breast cancer risk.  It is an analysis based on data from the massive PREDIMED study, the largest study ever done on the Mediterranean diet.  Estefania Toledo, et al. Mediterranean Diet and Invasive Breast Cancer Risk Among Women at High Cardiovascular Risk in the PREDIMED Trial . JAMA Internal Medicine, 2015.  Aim of The Study  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a Mediterranean diet, supplemented with either extra virgin olive oil or nuts, on the risk of breast cancer.  How The Study Was Designed  This paper is based on the famous PREDIMED study, a large multicenter randomized controlled trial on the Mediterranean diet.  The study was originally designed to test whether a Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, which it did ( 7 ).  This part of the study only evaluated women, not men. The women were between 60 to 80 years of age, had no heart disease, but had either type 2 diabetes or at least 3 major risk factors for heart disease.  The trial included a total of 4282 women, which were randomized into 3 different diet groups:   A Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (MED+EVOO).  A Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (MED+Nuts).  A “low-fat” diet (control group).   Those in the olive oil group received a liter (34 oz) of extra virgin olive oil per week, while those in the nut group received 30 grams (1 oz) per day of mixed nuts. These foods were provided to the participants for free.  Both group and individual sessions with dietitians were included to ensure compliance to the prescribed diets. Compliance was evaluated using dietary screening questionnaires.  There were no recommendations to cut calories or increase physical activity in any group.  The women in the study were followed for an average of 4.8 years.  Results  After a 4.8 year study period, 35 cases of malignant breast cancer were confirmed.  Relative to the “low-fat” control group, the risk of breast cancer was lower in both of the Mediterranean diet groups:   Med+Nuts: 38% lower risk, not statistically significant.  Med+EVOO: 62% lower risk, statistically significant.   This graph shows the differences between the groups (click for a larger version):   When all participants were analyzed, the 20% who consumed the most extra virgin olive oil had a whopping 82% lower risk of breast cancer compared to the 20% who consumed the least.  Additionally, each 5% increase in percentage of calories from extra virgin olive oil was linked to a 28% lower risk of breast cancer. Women who consumed over 15-20% of calories from extra virgin olive oil had the lowest risk.  Main Conclusions  According to this study, a Mediterranean diet can lead to a reduced risk of breast cancer if supplemented with extra virgin olive oil.  Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found. As in, the more extra virgin olive oil the women consumed, the lower their risk of breast cancer was.  The study did not find a statistically significant effect in the Mediterranean diet group that supplemented with nuts.  Biological Mechanism  The exact mechanism behind the breast cancer-lowering effects is not fully known at this point.  However, there are several possible explanations:   The mechanism may have something to do with reduced oxidative stress on a Mediterranean diet ( 8 , 9 ).   Extra virgin olive oil also contains many beneficial plant compounds, including powerful polyphenol antioxidants ( 10 , 11 ).   Oleic acid, the main fatty acid in olive oil, has also been shown to have anti-cancer effects in some studies ( 12 ).   Other compounds in extra virgin olive oil that may have anti-cancer effects include squalene and lignans ( 13 , 14 ).   Limitations  The study did have some notable limitations:   The study was designed with the end point of cardiovascular disease in mind, not breast cancer.   Some data on breast cancer, either before or during the study, may be missing because it wasn’t tracked as well as heart disease.   The cases of breast cancer in the study were relatively few, only 35.   This study included white postmenopausal women at high cardiovascular risk. The results may not apply to other age groups or ethnicities.   The Mediterranean diet groups got better social support than the control group in the beginning of the study.   The women in the “low-fat” control group did not reduce their fat intake substantially, so they were not really eating a low-fat diet.   Overall, however, the study was very well designed. It was a long-term randomized controlled trial looking at hard end points instead of just risk factors. This is about as good as it gets in studies on nutrition.  What do Other Studies Say?  As mentioned above, results from observational studies have been inconsistent.  Some of them show that people who follow a Mediterranean diet “pattern” have a lower risk of cancer ( 3 , 4 ), while other studies find no effects ( 5 , 6 ).  One other large randomized controlled trial has been done on the Mediterranean diet and cancer risk.  This study was called the Lyon Diet Heart study, and it showed that a Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of overall cancer (not just breast cancer) by 61% ( 15 ).  Summary and Real Life Applications  According to this study, a Mediterranean diet reduces breast cancer risk in women, especially when supplemented with extra virgin olive oil.  This study also shows that the women who eat the most extra virgin olive oil have the lowest risk of breast cancer, by far.  Combined with the cardiovascular benefits ( 7 ) and overall cancer risk reduction ( 15 ) of the Mediterranean diet, these are compelling reasons to follow a Mediterranean diet if your goal is to live a long life and reduce your risk of chronic disease.  This study also provides a compelling reason to eat more extra virgin olive oil. It also has numerous other benefits, which you can read about in this article here from 2014.  Extra virgin olive oil really may be the healthiest fat you can eat. It seems like a good idea to eat it in place of other cooking fats. It is a myth that olive oil is a poor choice for cooking.

	Does Eating or Skipping Breakfast Affect Weight Loss?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 21, 2015  The importance of eating breakfast is frequently highlighted in public health recommendations.  However, the supporting evidence is limited and mainly based on observational studies and short-term clinical trials ( 1 , 2 ).   Study Reviewed  A recent study investigated whether dietary recommendations were more effective at promoting weight loss when coupled with the advice to either eat or skip breakfast.  Dhurandhar et al. The effectiveness of breakfast recommendations on weight loss: a randomized controlled trial . American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2014.  Materials and Methods  This 16-week randomized controlled trial took place in multiple locations in Europe and the USA.  A total of 309 overweight or obese men and women between the ages of 20 and 65 were recruited in the study.  At the start of the study, all participants got dietary recommendations from the USDA in the form of a pamphlet.  Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups:   Breakfast : Advice to eat breakfast before 10 AM every day.   No breakfast : Advice to eat nothing before 11 AM every day.   Control : No advice regarding breakfast.   The randomization procedure was stratified, meaning that the initial breakfast skippers and eaters were randomized separately. This was done to minimize bias.  To increase compliance, the participants got phone call reminders on weeks 4, 8 and 12.  Compliance was also checked with daily diaries in which the participants indicated whether they were able to follow the breakfast recommendations or not.  Body weight and height were measured at the start of the study. Weight was measured again at the end.  The main outcome measure was weight change during the course of the study. The weight change was then compared between groups.  Results  The study did find that the recommendations were effective at changing people’s breakfast habits.  In other words, those who were asked to skip breakfast managed to do so, and those who were asked to eat breakfast did so as well.  However, there was no significant difference in weight loss between groups.  This chart shows the weight loss among the study groups, divided into two parts depending on the participants’ eating habits before the study.   As you can see, the difference between groups is small and insignificant. All groups lost a bit of weight, but the difference between groups was less than half a pound.  A total of 283 participants finished the study, but 26 dropped out for various reasons.  Main Conclusion  The main conclusion is that recommendations to skip or eat breakfast do not have any significant effects on weight loss in overweight/obese men and women.  Limitations  The study does not have any major limitations.  However, it would have been useful if the study had measured body composition or other metabolic variables instead of just body weight.  In addition, the study was only 16 weeks. It is possible that the study was too short to detect long-term effects.  As pointed out by the researchers, the study indicates that breakfast recommendations do not influence weight loss in a free-living setting.  However, it does not rule out the possibility that breakfast habits can affect weight loss in a controlled setting.  Strengths  So far, this is the largest randomized controlled trial on the effect of breakfast recommendations on weight loss.  The large number of participants and multiple study sites ensure adequate statistical power and allow the results to be generalized.  What Do Other Studies Say?  Observational studies indicate that eating breakfast is linked with lower body weight ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ).  However, observational studies can only provide suggestive evidence. There may be other beneficial factors in people’s lifestyles that are also associated with the habit of eating breakfast.  Several short-term clinical studies have investigated the issue. They indicate that breakfast may promote weight loss ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).  Unlike the current study, these studies aimed at explaining potential mechanisms in a controlled setting. They were also of much shorter duration.  One 12-week study investigated the effect of skipping breakfast in 52 moderately obese women ( 12 ).  Supporting the results of the current study, there were no significant differences between groups. However, there was a non-significant trend towards greater weight loss in those who had breakfast.  Recently, several scientists have pointed out that the evidence regarding the effect of breakfast habits on obesity is severely limited ( 1 , 2 ).  Summary  In short, this study suggests that advising people to either skip or eat breakfast has no effects on weight loss.  Although it doesn’t rule out that breakfast habits may have metabolic consequences, it strongly suggests that breakfast recommendations do not have a significant impact when people are trying to lose weight.

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Sep 11th – Sep 18th)  By Kris Gunnars, BSc  |  September 18, 2015  This is an overview of everything new and interesting that happened in nutrition science in the past week, from last Friday until today.   Research Review  We reviewed two new studies this week:  Monday  Link:  Review: Health Benefits of Sustained Weight Loss  Study: Rueda-Clausen et al. Health Benefits of Long-Term Weight Loss Maintenance. Annual Reviews of Nutrition, 2015.  Summary: This was a review of all the powerful health benefits that obese people experience if they manage to lose weight and keep it off for a long time.   Wednesday  Link:  7 Days of Overeating and Inactivity Causes Insulin Resistance  Study: Boden et al. Excessive Caloric Intake Acutely Causes Oxidative Stress, GLUT4 carbonylation, and insulin resistance in healthy men. Science Translational Medicine 2015.  Summary: This is a controlled trial in a metabolic ward that got quite a lot of media attention this week. It was a study in 6 men who were overfed 2.5 times their normal calorie intake and confined to a room where they didn’t perform any physical activity.  This study found that these men became insulin resistant in a short amount of time. The mechanism seemed to be increased oxidative stress inside fat cells, which inactivated the insulin-regulated glucose transporters (GLUT-4) in the cells.  This may shed some light on what ultimately causes insulin resistance, which is believed to be a major driver of many common diseases. This includes type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.  Other Studies and Papers From Around The Web  Many interesting studies were published in the past week.  Diets and Diet Patterns  Study: EstefanĂ­a Toledo, et al. Mediterranean Diet and Invasive Breast Cancer Risk Among Women at High Cardiovascular Risk in the PREDIMED Trial. JAMA Internal Medicine, 2015.  Summary: This paper based on data from the PREDIMED study found that a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil reduced breast cancer risk by 0.68%, but a Mediterranean diet with nuts reduced the risk by a non-significant 41%.  They found that each 5% increase in calories from extra-virgin olive oil reduced the risk of breast cancer by 28%. Given that breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, this is an important finding.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Study: Clemens Drenowatz.

	7 Days of Overeating and Inactivity Causes Insulin Resistance  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 16, 2015  Obesity is one of the most common consequences of the Western lifestyle.  Unsurprisingly, obesity is not only a matter of weight. It is also associated with a variety of health problems.  The most common health problems associated with obesity are collectively known as metabolic syndrome.  Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are among the main components of this syndrome, but how they are linked with obesity is not clearly understood.   Article Reviewed  A team of scientists at Temple University, Philadelphia, set out to investigate how overeating and obesity may be linked with insulin resistance.  Boden et al. Excessive Caloric Intake Acutely Causes Oxidative Stress, GLUT4 carbonylation, and insulin resistance in healthy men . Science Translational Medicine 2015.  Materials and Methods  Six healthy, middle-aged men volunteered to participate in the study.  Half of them were normal weight, while the rest were slightly overweight.  None of them had a family history of diabetes or other endocrine disorders, and they were not taking any drugs.  They spent one week at a hospital, where they were overfed and confined to their rooms to minimize physical activity.  Their diet consisted of approximately 6000 kcal per day, a whopping 200–250% increase in their normal calorie intake.  It was a typical US diet, standardized to 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 15% protein.  Various blood analyses were done every day, while other measurements, such as fat biopsies, were only performed at the beginning and end of the study. Body weight and composition were also measured.  Results  By the end of the study, the participants had gained an average 3.5 kg, all in the form of fat mass.   On day two, insulin levels rose quickly with signs of increased insulin resistance, gradually becoming worse as the study progressed.  This chart shows how fasting insulin changed during the study (increased by 150%):   In addition, oxidative stress increased significantly during the study.  The source of this oxidative stress was found in fat tissue, as evident from fat biopsies. Apparently, fat tissue is particularly stressed during periods of overeating.  Most importantly, the study strongly suggests that oxidative stress was the cause of insulin resistance in the study participants.  In fact, oxidative stress appears to inactivate GLUT-4 , an insulin-regulated glucose transporter mainly found in fat tissue and muscles.  Insulin resistance did not seem to be triggered by elevated levels of free fatty acids (FAA) or increased inflammation. Both remained constant during the study period.  Main Conclusions  This study showed that overfeeding causes insulin resistance.  It indicates that insulin resistance is caused by oxidative stress associated with increased storage of fat in fat tissue.  The oxidative stress seems to disrupt blood sugar regulation by damaging GLUT4, a protein responsible for transporting glucose from the bloodstream into cells.  Limitations  Apart from the small number of participants, the study doesnât have any obvious limitations.  However, for comparison, it would have been useful to have a control group receiving a weight-maintenance diet.  As the researchers point out, inactivity is likely responsible for a part of the adverse changes seen in the study.  What Do Other Studies Say?  A slower and less pronounced increase in insulin resistance has been found in other studies feeding participants less amounts of excess calories.  One 8-week study in 29 healthy men investigated the effect of increasing calorie intake by 40%. It found an 18% increase in insulin resistance ( 1 ).  Another study in 40 healthy men and women showed that eating an excess of 1040 kcal/day for a month decreased insulin sensitivity by 8% ( 2 ).  Previous research also indicates that insulin resistance is linked with oxidative stress and that adipose tissue is heavily stressed during overeating ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ).  For this reason, several human trials have tried to decrease insulin resistance by using antioxidants (compounds that act against oxidative stress). However, their results have been inconsistent ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ).  The results of the current study are supported by studies of cells in test tubes, showing that oxidative stress causes insulin resistance on the cellular level ( 13 , 14 , 15 ).  Studies in humans and animals also indicate that a high-fat diet increases oxidative stress and insulin resistance ( 7 ).  Summary  In short, this study clearly shows that drastic overeating and inactivity are seriously unhealthy. They increase oxidative stress and cause insulin resistance in as little as two days.  Oxidative stress impairs blood sugar regulation by inactivating a protein called GLUT4, responsible for transporting glucose from the bloodstream into cells.  Simply put, overeating and lack of exercise may explain what causes insulin resistance – a leading driver of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, which are currently massive health problems worldwide.

	Review: Health Benefits of Sustained Weight Loss  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 14, 2015  There is much more to weight loss than meets the eye.  In fact, weight loss is associated with multiple health benefits, and may be the single most important thing you can do to improve your health (if you are overweight).   Article Reviewed  A recent review article in the magazine Annual Review of Nutrition provided a comprehensive overview of the health benefits of maintaining weight loss in the long term.  Rueda-Clausen et al. Health Benefits of Long-Term Weight Loss Maintenance . Annual Reviews of Nutrition, 2015.   Aims  The main aim of the review was to summarize the evidence for the risks and benefits of sustained weight loss.  How is Sustained Weight Loss Defined?  Before discussing weight loss maintenance, it is important to explain or define what that means exactly.  Several researchers have come up with their own definitions.  Wing and Hill defined sustained weight loss in the following way ( 1 ):  Sustained weight loss is an intentional weight loss that has been maintained for at least a year. Additionally, it is equivalent to at least 10% of the initial body weight before deciding to lose weight.  The 10% cut-off value was based on the fact that previous studies had shown metabolic benefits from weight loss of that magnitude ( 2 , 3 ).  Further weight loss may have additional benefits.  It is Difficult to Determine the Health Benefits of Weight Loss  It can be very hard to determine the independent effects of weight loss on health.  There are a few reasons for this:   Dietary changes: Weight loss is usually accompanied with changes in diet. Dietary changes may have very strong effects on health.   Increased exercise: Weight loss is often associated with increased exercise. On its own, exercise may have immense health benefits.   Calorie restriction: Negative energy balance, the main reason for weight loss, also has huge health benefits.   As a result, it very difficult (or impossible) to isolate the health benefits of the weight loss itself.  This is also the reason why weight loss strategies may have powerful effects on health outcomes, even though the weight loss itself is minimal.  Health Benefits of Weight Loss Maintenance  According to this review, losing weight and keeping it off may improve:   Blood pressure: Losing weight may significantly improve blood pressure.   Heart health: Weight loss has been associated with improved heart health and a reduction in risk factors.   Type 2 diabetes: In people with insulin resistance (impaired glucose tolerance), weight loss may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes or slow its progression.   Blood sugar control: In people with type 2 diabetes, weight loss leads to better blood sugar control.   Blood lipid profile: Weight loss causes improvements in the levels of blood lipids, reducing triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol.   Osteoarthritis: Weight loss may reduce symptoms in people with osteoarthritis.   Obstructive sleep apnea: Although weight loss rarely resolves obstructive sleep apnea completely, it may significantly improve symptoms.   Obesity hyperventilation syndrome: Substantial weight loss can improve symptoms in people with obesity hyperventilation syndrome.   Asthma: Weight loss maintenance may significantly improve asthma symptoms.   Cancer: There is some evidence to indicate reduced risk of cancer with sustained weight loss.   Quality of life: Health-related quality of life is significantly improved with weight loss.   All-cause mortality: Studies suggest that weight loss may be linked to reduced risk of all-cause mortality.   Does Short-Term Weight Loss Have any Benefits?  Short-term weight loss has many benefits, similar to sustained weight loss.  The difference is that the health benefits of short-term weight loss are limited to the actual weight loss period. When people start regaining weight, health status may start worsening accordingly.  However, some studies indicate that short-term weight loss may have health benefits in the long term. This phenomenon is called the “legacy effect” or the “metabolic memory effect” ( 4 ).  Health Risks of Weight Loss  When it comes to health and nutrition, very few things are perfect.  There are usually some downsides, but many of them may depend on the individual or be limited to specific situations.  In addition, the weight loss method affects the potential health benefits and risks considerably.  Weight loss methods can be divided into three main categories:   Behavioral: This group of weight loss methods includes diets and exercise programs.   Pharmacological: This category includes weight loss methods that involve medications and supplements.   Surgical: When other methods fail, liposuction and other surgical methods, such as gastric bypass, are occasionally used to treat obesity.   In general, behavioral weight loss methods are considered the safest approach, whereas pharmacological and surgical procedures are more risky.  Apart from potential complications associated with surgical methods and medications, weight loss may worsen symptoms in the following diseases:   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: In people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fast weight loss may worsen liver health.   Gallbladder disease: Weight loss may increase the risk and severity of gallbladder disease.   Take Home Message  It is clear that intentional, sustained weight loss may have significant beneficial effects on various health outcomes.  However, it is difficult to isolate weight loss from other lifestyle factors that are unavoidably associated with weight loss. These include increased exercise, changes in diet and calorie restriction.  In certain individuals, weight loss may worsen liver health and gallbladder disease. However, other health benefits far outweigh possible adverse health effects.  In short, if you are obese and want to improve your health, losing weight may be the single most effective way to do that.  Tags: Obesity , Weight loss

	Past Week in Nutrition Science (Sep 4th – Sep 11th)  By Kris Gunnars, BSc  |  September 11, 2015  This is a review of everything new that happened in the field of nutrition science in the past week, or from last Friday (September 4th) until today (September 11th).   Research Reviews  This week we reviewed two new studies:  Monday  Link:  New Study Shows That Reducing Saturated Fat is (Almost) Useless  Study: Hooper Lee, et al. Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2015.  Summary: This is a new Cochrane review of the link between saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease. It is probably the highest quality study ever published on this issue.  They found that reducing saturated fat intake did not affect cardiovascular disease. However, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat caused a minor reduction in cardiovascular events (but not heart attacks or death).   Wednesday  Link:  Biggest Review Ever on Whole Grains and Blood Lipids  Study: Hollander, et al. Whole-grain and blood lipid changes in apparently healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2015.  Main points: This is the largest meta-analysis to date on whole grains and blood lipids. It found a minor reduction in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.  However, this study found that oats were the only grain to have a significant effect.  Others, such as wheat, rice or corn, did not have any major effects on blood lipids, but there wasn’t enough data to conclude anything about barley or rye.  Other Studies From Around The Web  The past week was rather slow, with no major releases from the top nutrition journals.  However, a new edition of The International Journal of Obesity was published, so there are plenty of interesting studies on obesity to look at ( full overview here ).  General Nutrition  There were 2 interesting studies in the “General Nutrition” category in the past week.  Study: Zizza CA, et al. The Contribution of Beverages to Intakes of Energy and MyPlate Components by Current, Former, and Never Smokers in the United States. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2015.  Summary: This analysis found that smokers tend to consume a higher amount of empty calories from sugar-sweetened beverages and alcoholic beverages.   Study: Cohen JFW, et al. Amount of Time to Eat Lunch Is Associated with Children’s Selection and Consumption of School Meal EntrĂŠe, Fruits, Vegetables, and Milk. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2015.  Summary: This study found that school children who had less than 20 minutes to eat lunch ate less vegetables, fruit and milk compared to school children who had over 25 minutes to eat.   Obesity and Weight Loss  Study: Byrne CS, et al. The role of short chain fatty acids in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis. International Journal of Obesity, 2015.  Summary: A review of the effects of short-chain fatty acids produced by gut bacteria from dietary fiber, and how they can affect appetite regulation and weight control.   Study: Klimentidis, YC, et al. High genetic risk individuals benefit less from resistance exercise intervention. International Journal of Obesity, 2015.  Summary: This randomized controlled trial showed that people with high genetic risk of obesity benefited less from resistance training (for body fat, body weight and abdominal fat) compared to people with low genetic risk.   Study: Hwang YC, et al. Visceral abdominal fat accumulation predicts the conversion of metabolically healthy obese subjects to an unhealthy phenotype. International Journal of Obesity, 2015.  Summary: This study showed that over 10 years, having high levels of visceral fat, low HDL cholesterol and high fasting insulin predicted that “metabolically healthy” obese people would become “metabolically unhealthy.”   Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes  Study: Bauer LB, et al. A pilot study examining the effects of consuming a high-protein vs normal-protein breakfast on free-living glycemic control in overweight/obese “breakfast skipping” adolescents. International Journal of Obesity, 2015.  Summary: This pilot controlled trial suggests that a high protein (35 grams) breakfast is better for blood sugar control in overweight/obese teenagers compared to a normal protein (13 grams) breakfast.   Digestive Health  Study: El-Salhy M, et al. The relation between celiac disease, nonceliac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome. Nutrition Journal, 2015.  Summary: A review of the interplay between celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome.   Micronutrients  Study: Quann EE, et al.

	Biggest Review Ever on Whole Grains and Blood Lipids  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 9, 2015  Whole grains have been considered to be healthy for a very long time.  Some of the health benefits of whole grains may be due to their effects on blood fats (cholesterol, triglycerides, etc).  However, the results of randomized controlled trials on the effect of whole grains on blood fats have been mixed ( 1 ).   Study Reviewed  A recent study assessed the effect of whole grains on blood fats by doing a meta-analysis, combining the results of many randomized controlled trials.  Hollander, et al. Whole-grain and blood lipid changes in apparently healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2015.   This study is the largest meta-analysis on the subject to date, and the only one that has distinguished between different grain types instead of just looking at “whole grains” as one big group.  Aim  The study aimed to assess the effect of whole grains on changes in blood fats, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.  Methods  The researchers searched the literature for randomized controlled trials.  They screened 6069 articles for eligibility and included those that fulfilled certain criteria.  These criteria included:   The study examined the effect of whole-grains, or diets rich in whole grains, on blood fats.   The control group had a diet low in, or without, whole grains.   The study focused on the grains themselves, not individual nutrients or dietary fiber.   Results  All in all, 24 randomized controlled trials with over 2275 participants were included.  Overall, the results of the analysis show that eating whole-grains causes the following changes in blood fats:   A decrease in LDL (“the bad”) cholesterol (Weighted difference: – 0.09 mmol/L or -3.48 mg/dL).   A decrease in total cholesterol (Weighted difference: -0.12 mmol/L or -4.68 mg/dL).   A non-significant tendency to decrease triglycerides (Weighted difference: -0.04 mmol/L or -3.54 mg/dL).   No change in HDL (“the good”) cholesterol.   When grain types were looked at individually, oats were responsible for most of the changes.  In comparison, other types of whole-grains had smaller or no significant effects.  Although eating whole grain oats was associated with a benefit, the study did not find a dose-response relationship, indicating that more is not necessarily better.  These results may be caused by the viscous beta-glucan fibers in oats, which have been shown to decrease total and LDL cholesterol in blood ( 2 ).  Barley and rye are also high in viscous fibers, such as beta-glucans. However, it was not possible to make any conclusions about barley and rye because of the few studies available.  Conclusions  The main conclusions of the study are:   Eating oats may reduce the risk of heart disease by improving the composition of blood fats.   In healthy people, other types of whole grains have smaller or no effects. It is not possible to draw conclusions about rye and barley due to a limited number of studies.   Limitations  This study only looked at the effects of whole grains in healthy adults. It is possible that they would have stronger effects in people with metabolic syndrome or a poor blood fat profile.  The study only looked at cholesterol, not lipoprotein markers like Apolipoprotein B or Apolipoprotein A1. These markers are more accurate predictors of cardiovascular risk than what was measured in the study.  Also, the study only looked at blood fats. It does not look at other health benefits of whole grains, such as blood sugar control, inflammatory markers or effects on weight loss.  What Do Other Studies Say?  The current study is the only meta-analysis that has investigated the effects of different whole grains on blood fats in a dose-dependent manner.  One other meta-analysis has examined similar studies, but it did not include as many studies as the current meta-analysis ( 3 ).  The results of that study were similar. It found that oats caused significant reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.  Real Life Applications  The blood-lipid lowering effects of whole grains are smaller than those achieved with medications.  Nevertheless, the effects are considered clinically relevant. This is particularly true of whole-grain oats.  Whole-grain oats can be recommended as a part of a heart-healthy diet, but the current evidence on other types of whole grains and blood fats is not impressive.

	New Study Shows That Reducing Saturated Fat is (Almost) Useless  By Kris Gunnars, BSc  |  September 7, 2015  For decades, saturated fat has been believed to be harmful.  This is claimed to be because saturated fat raises blood levels of cholesterol inside LDL lipoproteins, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (heart disease and strokes).  This is often referred to as the diet-heart hypothesis.  However, several major studies in recent years have challenged the diet-heart hypothesis and failed to find a relationship between saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease ( 1 , 2 ).   Study Reviewed  A new study recently came out that looks at the relationship between saturated fat consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Hooper Lee, et al. Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2015.  This is a systematic review and meta-analysis performed by the Cochrane collaboration, an independent organization of scientists that do objective and highly thorough reviews of randomized controlled trials.  When it comes to the quality of scientific evidence, it really doesn’t get much better than a Cochrane review.  Materials and Methods  The researchers searched the literature for randomized controlled trials that fulfilled certain criteria.  These included, but were not limited to:   There was a control group in each study.   The study instructed participants to reduce saturated fat, or replace it with other types of fats.   The study lasted for at least 24 months.   The study looked at hard end points, such as heart attacks and death.   All in all, 15 randomized controlled trials with over 59,000 participants were included.  Results  There were several interesting findings in the study.  Cardiovascular events  A cardiovascular event can refer to several different things. The study defined a “cardiovascular event” as:  “Combined CVD events. These included data available on any of the following: cardiovascular deaths, cardiovascular morbidity (non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular events, atrial fibrillation) and unplanned cardiovascular interventions (coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty).”  In the current review, intervention that reduced saturated fat intake led to a 17% reduction in cardiovascular events. The quality of evidence was deemed “moderate.”  All-cause mortality  All-cause mortality refers to death from any cause, including heart attacks, cancer, accidents and others.  This study showed that reducing saturated fat has no statistically significant effect on total mortality. In other words, you are just as likely to die if you significantly cut back on saturated fat intake.  Cardiovascular mortality  Cardiovascular mortality implies death caused by either heart attacks or strokes. These are currently the two of the world’s most common causes of premature death.  This study did not find any benefit of reducing saturated fat. In other words, those who reduced their intake of saturated fat were just as likely to die from heart attacks or strokes.  Fatal heart attacks  The study almost found a small reduction in fatal heart attack risk by reducing saturated fat. The risk ratio was 0.95, or a 5% reduction in risk.  However, this was not statistically significant.  Non-fatal heart attacks  The study found no reduction in non-fatal heart attacks.  Strokes  There were no reductions in strokes (bleeding or a blood clot in the brain) in groups who restricted their saturated fat intake.  Summary  All in all, the only benefit of reducing saturated fat intake was found in cardiovascular events. There was no statistically significant effect on mortality, death from cardiovascular disease, heart attacks or strokes.  However, when they analyzed the studies further, they found a significant reduction in cardiovascular events only when saturated fat was being replaced with polyunsaturated fats.  In other words, reducing saturated fat had no effect on its own, but replacing it with polyunsaturated fats led to a 27% reduced risk of cardiovascular events (but not death, heart attacks or strokes).  They also found that the people who had the greatest reduction in serum total cholesterol were the most likely to experience a benefit.  This implies that changes in fat intake may be beneficial when they actually lead to a significant improvement in blood lipids.  Conclusions  These were the conclusions of the study:  “The findings of this updated review are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat appears to be a useful strategy, and replacement with carbohydrate appears less useful, but effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat were unclear due to inclusion of only one small trial.  This effect did not appear to alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear.”  Cochrane reviews tend to be very conservative in their conclusions. Even though the data clearly suggests that reducing saturated fat is next to useless, they still claim in their conclusion that this is useful advice.  In this case, the study’s conclusions are not supported by the data.  Limitations  It is hard to find any limitations to this study. It is just about as good as it gets when it comes to studies on nutrition.  The only major flaw is the misleading conclusion.  What Other Studies Say  The findings of this study are similar to a previous Cochrane review that was done in 2011 ( 3 ).  It is also in line with findings from other recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses that did not find a link between saturated fat intake and heart disease ( 1 , 2 ).  Summary  Despite the strange conclusion of the study authors, the data they derived from their review is another nail in the coffin of the diet-heart hypothesis.  This high-quality study shows that reducing saturated fat has no effect on heart attacks, strokes or the risk of dying from all causes.  However, there may be a modest cardiovascular benefit to replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, nuts and olive oil.  According to this current study, this is unlikely to prolong your life, but it may reduce your risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event slightly.  Importantly, despite saturated fat not being harmful in reasonable amounts, this does not mean that people should go out of their way to eat more of them.  This study only looked at people using reasonable amounts of saturated fat, and does not exonerate bulletproof coffee users – which are using much higher amounts of saturated fat than the participants in this review.  Real Life Applications  Saturated fats appear to be neither good, nor bad. They are just neutral.  However, we do know that there are fats out there that have actual benefits.  Emphasizing foods that contain healthy fats, such as fish, nuts, seeds and extra virgin olive oil , may lead to a net health benefit.  In other words, don’t avoid saturated fats, but still try to prioritize whole foods that contain fats that have clearly been shown to be healthy.  Tags: Fats , Heart disease , Saturated fat

	Gluten Sensitivity – Is it All in Your Mind?  By Atli Arnarson, PhD  |  September 4, 2015  Gluten is a protein found in certain grains, especially wheat.  There are some people who react negatively when they eat gluten and experience adverse symptoms.  There is one well-defined disease called celiac disease, and then another more controversial condition called gluten sensitivity.  Celiac disease affects about 0.7-1% of people ( 1 ), but the numbers for gluten sensitivity range from 0.5-13% depending on the study ( 2 ).  Some experts even believe that gluten sensitivity isn’t a real condition.   Study Reviewed  Today’s study may be able to shed some light on gluten sensitivity and the usefulness of removing gluten from the diet.  Capannolo A, et al. Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity among Patients Perceiving Gluten-Related Symptoms. Digestion, 2015.  This study looked at almost 400 people who believed that they were gluten intolerant, and investigated whether these people actually benefitted from a gluten-free diet.  Introduction  Gluten intolerance is a general term used for adverse reactions to gluten in wheat , rye and barley.  It can be divided into two distinct conditions; celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.  Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in genetically predisposed people. It is triggered by the consumption of gluten. It is a serious condition, and most people who have it don’t know about it.  However, gluten sensitivity (often termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or NCGS) is a more controversial condition. It is not as easily identified, and its existence is debated.  Gluten sensitivity is claimed to be characterized by various adverse symptoms. These include digestive discomfort, bloating , diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, headache, anxiety, depression, skin rashes, sore joints and weight loss.  The diagnosis is based on the following criteria:   Gluten intolerance is suspected.   A gluten-free diet alleviates symptoms, and symptoms reappear on exposure to gluten.   Celiac disease and allergies have been ruled out.   Many scientists have speculated that gluten sensitivity is a misnomer – that it is caused by substances other than gluten.  Some researchers even believe that it’s all in the minds of people. No matter what kind of sickness people suffer from, it’s all blamed on wheat and gluten.  Aim of the Study  The aim of the current study was to find out how many of those with self-reported gluten intolerance actually had celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy.  Methods and Results  A total of 392 participants, both men and women, were included in the study.  They had one thing in common – they all complained of various general symptoms and believed them to be caused by gluten.  First, the researchers thoroughly tested all of the participants for celiac disease and wheat allergy.  Only 26 participants (6.6%) were positively diagnosed with celiac disease, and two (0.5%) turned out to be allergic to wheat.  This left 364 people who believed they reacted adversely to gluten, without a positive diagnosis of celiac disease or wheat allergy.  To investigate if any of the remaining participants had gluten sensitivity, they were put on a gluten-free diet for 6 months.  Then, those who experienced benefits while on the gluten-free diet were submitted to a “gluten re-challenge”. The gluten re-challenge involved going on a gluten-containing diet for a month.  To increase compliance, all participants were interviewed by a nutritionist on a monthly basis.  The diagnosis criteria of gluten sensitivity were the following:   The participant had to experience benefits on the 6-month gluten-free diet.   Going back on a gluten-containing diet caused the symptoms to return.   According to the study results, only 27 (7%) of the participants fulfilled these criteria, and were identified as “gluten sensitive”.  For this reason, the researchers concluded that only 14.5% of those who complained of gluten intolerance actually had issues with gluten or wheat.  On the other hand, 86% of people were wrong in their suspicions. Their symptoms were not relieved on a gluten-free diet, and their symptoms did not worsen when they started eating gluten again.  Here is an overview of the results:   Conclusions  The main conclusions of this study are:   The majority of people who complain of gluten intolerance do not suffer from gluten intolerance. Their symptoms have other causes.   Gluten sensitivity is about as common as celiac disease in people who claim that they are gluten intolerant.   Limitations  The study had several limitations.  First, there was no control group in the study. All participants were submitted to the same treatment.  It is impossible to know whether it was actually the gluten-free diet that caused improvements in symptoms among those 27 people who reported a positive change.  The improvement could simply have been due to chance. Symptoms tend to change naturally over time and are influenced by various lifestyle factors.  Second, the participants knew they were on a gluten-free diet. They also knew when they were submitted to a gluten re-challenge.  It can’t be ruled out that changes in symptoms were due to a placebo effect.  Third, self-reported symptoms are difficult to quantify, and there may be high variability in how people perceive and report symptoms.  In short, the study had several major design flaws, so the results should be taken with a grain of salt.  What Do Other Studies Say?  Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard in nutrition research.  So far, three randomized controlled trials have investigated gluten or wheat sensitivity.  Two of these studies have shown that people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS – a common digestive disorder) but not celiac disease experience improvements on a gluten-free diet ( 3 , 4 ).  These studies support gluten sensitivity as a real condition, and indicate that a gluten-free diet can be beneficial in people who don’t have celiac disease.  However, other researchers believe that these benefits are not caused by removing gluten, but other problematic substances in wheat, mostly FODMAPs.  FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed and cause digestive problems in many people.  One study fed isolated gluten to people who were not eating any FODMAPs. This study found no consistent adverse effects from gluten ( 5 ).  The study indicated that the benefits of gluten-free diets may be because these diets also remove wheat, which is a major source of FODMAPs.  As a result, some people claim that “wheat sensitivity” may be a more accurate term than “gluten sensitivity”. In those that do not have celiac disease, the benefits of removing wheat probably do not have anything to do with gluten.  Summary  The main message of this study review is that the great majority of people who think they are intolerant to gluten don’t actually benefit from a gluten-free diet.  The study indicates that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is about as common as celiac disease. The prevalence of celiac disease is around 0.7-1%.  However, the study has some major limitations so it cannot really provide any firm conclusions.  Given the body of evidence, non-celiac gluten sensitivity still probably exists, but it may be relatively rare.  The debate of gluten sensitivity is still up in the air, and we will review new studies as they come.  Real Life Applications  All this being said, if you consistently feel bad after eating gluten-containing cereals, you should definitely go on a gluten-free diet and see if your symptoms improve.  Even if you don’t have celiac disease, a gluten-free diet may be worth trying. In fact, there is no nutrient in wheat, barley and rye that can’t be provided by other foods.  Gluten- and wheat-free diets may have benefits for some people, but there is currently no evidence that warrants prescribing them to the general population.  In fact, the current study suggests that the majority of people would not benefit from such a diet, even people who believe that gluten causes them problems.  Tags: Digestion , Gluten
