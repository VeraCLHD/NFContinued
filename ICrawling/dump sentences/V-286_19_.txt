Compared to patients with other causes of dementia, this nostril asymmetry of odor detection was 100% sensitive and specific, meaning no false positives and no false negatives, and compared to healthy people 100% sensitive in picking up cases of Alzheimer’s, and 92% specific–meaning in this study, if you had Alzheimer’s, there was a 100% chance having a wide left-right discrepancy would show it, but if you had that discrepancy, the chances of having Alzheimer’s were 92%, meaning some false positives.The reason they say “probable” Alzheimer’s is the only way you can really confirm if someone has it is on autopsy.
