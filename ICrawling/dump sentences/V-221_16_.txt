If instead of having a tuna salad sandwich, we had a tofu salad sandwich with the same amount of protein, no effect.And, same thing happens with eggs and dairy protein, both in people with normal and diseased kidneys.Short-term studies have indicated that substituting plant protein, like soy, for animal protein is associated with less hyperfiltration and protein leakage, therefore, slowing deterioration of kidney function.
