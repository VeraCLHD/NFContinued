Well, raisins didn’t lead to much acid at all, and the big surprise was that if you combined the non-sugar coated raisin with the bran flakes to create a kind of experimental raisin bran, the raisins seemed to prevent some of the acid the bran flakes were causing.So, although raisins are like 70% pure sugar, they caused less acid to be produced; so, although they’re sweet, they don’t appear to adhere to our teeth.
