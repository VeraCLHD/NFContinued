All foodstuff of animal origin contains oestradiol, which is at least 10,000-fold more potent than most xenoestrogens, and dietary exposure—meat, dairy products and eggs—to these natural sex steroids is therefore highly relevant since the hormones in these animals are identical to our own.Estrogens are also contained in meat and eggs, but the major sources are milk and dairy products.
