Maybe because of all the white rice they eat?Just like eating whole fruit is associated with a lower risk of diabetes, whereas eating fruit processed into juice may not just be neutral but actually increase diabetes risk, eating whole grains–like whole wheat bread or brown rice–is associated with a lower risk of diabetes, whereas eating white rice, a processed grain, may not just be neutral but may actually increase diabetes risk.White rice consumption does not appear to be associated with increased risk of heart attack or stroke, though, which is a relief after this earlier study in China suggested a connection with stroke.
