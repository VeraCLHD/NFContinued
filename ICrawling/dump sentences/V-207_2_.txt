The IgA in our saliva, for example, is the first line of defense against respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and influenza.And moderate aerobic exercise, even just 30 minutes in the gym three times a week, may be all it takes to significantly boost IgA levels and significantly decrease the risk of coming down with flu-like symptoms.But weâ€™ve known for a long time that prolonged heavy exercise may reduce resistance to infectious disease, manifested by an apparent two to six fold increase in upper respiratory tract infection symptoms for several weeks following marathon running.Even just a single bout of over strenuous exercise may drop IgA levels.
