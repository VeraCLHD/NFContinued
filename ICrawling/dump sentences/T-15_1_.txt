pH is a measure of acidity and alkalinity: higher pH means more basic/alkaline and lower pH means more acidic.Ancestral human diets may have been largely plant-based, with consumption of animal products being rare and intermittent, making those diets more basic/alkalizing than is the typically acid producing Western diet (standard American diet—SAD) of today.The balance of acid/base-inducing foods determines the “dietary acid load” (DAL).
