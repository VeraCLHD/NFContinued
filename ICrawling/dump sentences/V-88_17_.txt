For those of you unfamiliar with my work, every year, I read through every issue of every English-language nutrition journal in the world—so busy folks like you don’t have to.I then compile all the most interesting, the most groundbreaking, the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day for my nonprofit site, NutritionFacts.org.Everything on the website is free.
