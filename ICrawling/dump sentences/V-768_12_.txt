A recent study found that a significant increase in oxidative stress happened within the bodies of women on iron supplements.And so, before going on iron supplements, I would suggest talking to your physician about first trying to treat it through diet aloneâ€”by eating lots of healthy iron-rich foods, like chickpeas and pumpkin seeds, while consuming vitamin C-rich foods at the same meal, such as citrus, tropical fruits, broccoli, bell peppers, which improve plant iron absorption, while at the same time avoiding drinking tea and coffee with your meals, which can impair iron absorption.Since organic acids like vitamin C can boost iron absorption, the Coca Cola company commissioned a study to see if drinking Coke would do the same thing.
