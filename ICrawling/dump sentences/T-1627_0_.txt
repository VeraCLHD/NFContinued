Salads traditionally are cold dishes consisting of vegetables and/or fruit, often with leafy greens as a base.Because salads primarily consist of raw or cooked vegetables packed with antioxidants and other phytochemicals, they may help the body resist cancer, promote heart health, and improve organ systems such as lung function in children with asthma.Salads filled with water-rich vegetables may promote lower calorie consumption by increasing the feeling of fullness and reducing meal calorie intake, leading to weight loss.
