Despite the promising autopsy and ecologic (meaning, population) data I just covered, supporting a specific association between low magnesium levels and sudden cardiac death, there’s only been two studies prospectively examining the association—this one, from the Harvard Nurses’ Study, published in 2011, and this one, from 2010; “The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities” study, covering a multiethnic population of thousands of men and women.High blood levels of magnesium were associated “with an almost 40% reduced risk” of sudden cardiac death, and “women in the highest compared with the lowest [quarter] of dietary and [blood] magnesium had a 34% and 77% lower” risk of sudden cardiac death, respectively.Another 2011 study noted: “Magnesium is an essential mineral in whole grains, leafy green vegetables, legumes—meaning beans, peas, lentils and soy—and nuts [as well as seeds], that acts as a co-factor in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the human body.
