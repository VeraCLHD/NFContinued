There are only two ways to truly get enough—sun or supplements, and it depends where you live.Basically, no matter how long you sunbathe nude in December and January—in our nation’s capitol, for example—the sun’s rays are at such an angle that we don’t make any vitamin D. So, the latest science supports supplemental D during the winter if you’re above LA/Dallas/Atlanta—or, for anyone, anywhere, any time not getting enough sun.All right, it’s time for a lightning round question.
