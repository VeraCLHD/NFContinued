Your body can break them down into all the essential amino acids it needs, but it just doesn’t stimulate the same kind of real estate boom that animal protein does, so you don’t get as many new cancer condos poppin’ up in your body.That’s my attempt at a lay explanation; for any biochem geeks out there, basically, unlike the essentials, particularly arginine and the pyruvate precursors may be shunted into gluconeogenesis, oxidized into urea, and so, you know, tend to present less of a proteogenic stimulus, but back to me speaking English.There’s only one truly “perfect protein.”
