“The intensity of exposure to these viruses in the general population” is presumably nowhere near that “experienced by poultry workers,” though “the general population is nevertheless widely exposed” to the viruses—just because we do eat so many chickens and eggs.This is supported by data showing that it’s not only the factory farm workers that are at higher risk for brain tumors, but also butchers or meat-cutters who have no exposure to live birds—especially those that don’t wear gloves, apparently, and who frequently have cuts on their hands.
