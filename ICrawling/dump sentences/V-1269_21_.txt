B12 also evidently makes you put on lipstick?But you can suffer cognitive decline, or become suicidally depressed because of B12 deficiency, as this 23-year-old lifelong vegetarian did.This 38-year-old vegan was misdiagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, and institutionalized because of the hallucinations and psychotic delusions triggered by his B12 deficiency.As bad as all these examples are, though, these folks were just hurting themselves.But not taking vitamin B12 during pregnancy is inexcusable.
