You could still, I don’t know, choke on a chicken bone, puncture an artery, and bleed to death, but the infectious disease problem with chicken is between when you first touch the package at the store, and when it finally makes it into the pot.You can have all the safe cooking labels you want, but that won’t raise awareness that bacteria from the surface of the chicken meat can stick to the hands of the cook, or could be spread in the kitchen environment, and subsequently may contaminate ready-to-eat foods, like salads, or already cooked foods, accompanying the meal.Why don’t we have that kind of label instead of just safe cooking?
