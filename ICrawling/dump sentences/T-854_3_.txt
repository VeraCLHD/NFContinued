When a study compared multiple varieties of juice, purple grape juice was ranked first in terms of the amount of phenolics—phytonutrients that may provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease.Phytonutrients, such as those found in grape juice, may also play a role in increasing thermogenesis (heat generation) and fat oxidation, which both enhance metabolism.If grape juice has these benefits, consider how many more may be gained from eating intact grapes.
