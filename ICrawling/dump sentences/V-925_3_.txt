Notes one of the investigators on this study: “Almost 75 percent of heart attack patients fell within [the] recommended targets for LDL cholesterol, demonstrating that the current guidelines may not be low enough to cut heart attack risk…” Close to half had “optimal” levels, though I’m not sure their grieving spouses and orphaned children will take much comfort in that fact.So, we have to drop our cholesterol even lower than so-called “optimal.”
