Spinach appears to be protective in vitro against breast cancer, brain tumor, kidney cancer, lung cancer, pediatric brain tumor, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer cells, due perhaps in part to its chlorophyll content, which may protect DNA against mutations.Spinach is a great source of folate, which may be preferable to folic acid supplements (though the latter should probably still be taken in early pregnancy).
