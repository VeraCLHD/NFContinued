Turmeric is an active ingredient in numerous supplements, but the industry is poorly regulated and many of these supplements donâ€™t contain the ingredients on the label.While curcumin has been identified as an active ingredient in turmeric, it is only one of many active ingredients, and for this reason, those interested in diet supplementation should consume the whole herb, turmeric, rather than just curcumin.
