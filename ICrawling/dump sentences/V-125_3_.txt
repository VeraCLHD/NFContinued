Lack of exercise was number ten, then too much sodium, then not enough nuts and seeds, not enough whole grains, not enough vegetables, and number 18 was not getting enough long-chain omega 3 fatty acids found in seafood due to its purported protective effect against heart disease.Even years ago, when this was published, however, they were already questioning the benefits of these fish fats, as more and more randomized controlled trials put them to the test and they failed, culminating in the recent meta-analysis that I profiled previously, that appeared to put the issue to rest.Cardiovascular protection isnâ€™t the only thing fishes and fish oil consumption were hyped for, though.
