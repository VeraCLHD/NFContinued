The remarkable finding that progressive endothelial dysfunction, the decline in the functioning of our arteries, is not an inevitable consequence of aging, that we can retain the arterial function we had in our 20’s into our 60’s, like the elderly Chinese, may, in part, be due to green tea, but other important dietary differences, including  increased consumption of vegetables and fishes with lower consumption of other meat and dairy in the traditional Chinese diet, may be contributing to the protection observed in older Chinese arteries.
