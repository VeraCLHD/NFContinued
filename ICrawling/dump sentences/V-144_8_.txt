Some of the flavorings you can use instead of salt include pepper, onion, garlic, tomato, sweet peppers, basil, parsley, thyme, celery, lime, chilli, nettle, rosemary, smoke flavor, curry, coriander, and lemon.Even if you do add salt, though, itâ€™s probably better than eating out, where even at non-fast food restaurants, they tend to pile it on.
