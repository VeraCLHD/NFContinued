Extra virgin olive oil has more of a neutral effect on artery function—it neither helps nor hinders artery function—but neither regular olive oil nor extra-virgin olive oil were found to significantly reduce heart attack rates.Some studies suggest endothelial function improves on a Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive oil, but perhaps that’s because the diet is also rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and walnuts: dietary fruits and vegetables appear to provide some protection against the direct impairment of endothelial function produced by high-fat foods, including olive oil.If you are going to consume olive oil, choose extra virgin olive oil.
