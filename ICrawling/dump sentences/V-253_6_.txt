Olive oil may be better than omega-6-rich oils, or saturated fats, but most of the studies showing adverse effects were done on regular, refined olive oil, not extra virgin.Extra virgin olive oil retains a fraction of the anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found in the olive fruit, and so doesnâ€™t appear to induce the spike in inflammatory markers caused by regular olive oil.
