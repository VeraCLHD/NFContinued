All I can say with certainty is that if you eat less, your cholesterol will likely improve.But because of this extreme “interindividual variation,” this wide variability in baseline cholesterol levels for any given saturated fat intake, if you take a cross-section of the population, you can find no statistical correlation between saturated fat intake and cholesterol levels, because it’s not like everyone who eats a certain set amount of saturated fat is going to have over a certain cholesterol.
