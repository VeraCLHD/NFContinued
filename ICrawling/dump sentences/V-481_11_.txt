Cigarette smoke is more toxic, but three out of four of the brands of liquid smoke they bought at the supermarket killed off even more cells, leading them to conclude that the “cytotoxic potential of some commercial smoke flavourings is greater than [that of liquid] cigarette smoke…”—a finding they no doubt celebrated, given that the researchers were paid employees of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.Unfortunately, they didn’t name names of the offending brands.
