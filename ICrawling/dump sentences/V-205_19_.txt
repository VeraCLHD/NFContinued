Fifteen chapters of the most interesting, groundbreaking, and practical science I could find, delivered with as much humor as I could manage in the context of death.I insisted the publisher include all hundred plus pages of citations, which comes out to be close to 3,000 references, but I didnâ€™t want this to be a book on some Dr. Greger diet; I wanted it to be the best-available-evidence diet.
