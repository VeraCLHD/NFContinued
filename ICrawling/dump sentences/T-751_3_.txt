Smoked food products amplify cancer-related dangers, with smoked salmon being the worst of all tested smoked foods.Fish consumption has been linked to a wide range of conditions including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), type 2 diabetes, kidney stones, atrial fibrillation, lower IQs among children, smaller infant brain size, shortened telomeres, which are a sign of aging, lower sperm counts, lower testosterone, more symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and earlier puberty.Fish consumption is also responsible for parasitic fish worm allergies, gold dust retinopathy, mad fish disease, food poisoning from fish toxins, chemical obesogens that may cause obesity, neurotoxic substances that are magnified when farmed fish are fed animal products, fish-induced keriorrhea, a form of amnesia, cataracts, ciguatera poisoning and the fecal contamination of sushi.
