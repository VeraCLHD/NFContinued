If we have one ApoE4 gene, either from our mom or dad, like about 15% of the U.S. population do, our risk of getting Alzheimer’s is tripled, and if we’re like the 1 in 50 folks who have ApoE4 genes from both parents, we may be at nine times the risk.The highest frequency of ApoE4 in the world is in Nigeria, but they also have some of the lowest Alzheimer’s rates.
