In one study, researchers found that sweet potato protein slows the growth of colon cancer cells and cancer cell migration.Residents of Okinawa, Japan, traditionally consumed a diet made up of less than 1% fish, less than 1% meat and less than 1% dairy/eggs; this high antioxidant diet consisted of more than a 96% plant-based diet, most especially purple and orange sweet potatoes.As a result, Okinawans enjoyed six to twelve times fewer heart disease deaths than Americans, two to three times fewer colon cancer deaths, seven times fewer prostate cancer deaths and a five-and-a-half times lower risk of dying from breast cancer.Sweet potatoes are high in fiber, which may help lower the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer and obesity.
