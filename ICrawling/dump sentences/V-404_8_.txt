When those are all ruled out as well, then I’d suggest people suffering from chronic suspicious symptoms should try a gluten-free diet, and if symptoms improve, stick with it, though maybe rechallenging with gluten periodically.Unlike celiac disease, a gluten-free diet is begun not to prevent serious complications from an autoimmune reaction, but just to resolve gluten sensitivity symptoms to try to improve patients’ quality of life.
