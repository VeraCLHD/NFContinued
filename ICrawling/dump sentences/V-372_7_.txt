What human data do we have about GMO safety?This study was purportedly to confirm DNA from genetically modified crops can be transferred into humans who eat them, but thatâ€™s not what the study found, just that plant DNA in general may be found in the human bloodstream with no stipulations of harm.This study, however, did find a GMO crop protein in people, detected in 93% of blood samples of pregnant women, 80% of umbilical cord blood, and 69% of sample from nonpregnant women.
