If only researchers would design an experiment directly comparing phytonutrient supplements to actual fruits and vegetables head to head against asthma, but such a study had never been done, until now.The same amazing study that compared the seven fruit and vegetables a day diet to the three fruit and vegetables a day diet then commenced a parallel, randomized, controlled supplementation trial with capsules of tomato extract, which boosted the power of five tomatoes in one little pill, and the study subjects were given three pills a day.So who did better, the group that ate seven servings of actual fruits and vegetables a day, or the group that ate three servings a day but also took 15 supposed serving equivalents in pill form?
