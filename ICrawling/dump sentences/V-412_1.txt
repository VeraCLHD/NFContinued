In a study of 100 vegetarians compared to a 100 nonvegetarians, the vegetarians had better periodontal conditions: less signs of inflammation like gum bleeding, less periodontal damage and a better dental home care, brushing and flossing 2.17 times a day compared to 2.02 times a day, not that much of a difference, so maybe it was something about their diet, though vegetarians may have a healthier lifestyle overall beyond just avoiding meat.
