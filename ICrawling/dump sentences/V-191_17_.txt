In retrospect, the route of administration may have been key.In the original study, they started out infusing ten grams of vitamin C a day intravenously, whereas in both of the Mayo studies designed to replicate the protocol, they just gave people vitamin C supplements to take orally—just sent them home to swallow 20 capsules a day—same dose, but ten grams given orally is not the same thing as ten grams given IV, something that wasn’t discovered until decades later.It turns out vitamin C concentration in our bloodstream is tightly controlled, such that if you try to swallow more than you’d get eating five servings of fruits and vegetables, your body cuts down on the absorption in the intestine.
