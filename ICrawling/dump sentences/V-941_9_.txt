Cloudy apple juice has more—way more, but that’s because it’s cheating, and actually has a tiny bit of the actual fruit in there, which is what makes it cloudy.So imagine how superior an entire apple would be compared to juice—or even better, a whole pomegranate, or Concord grapes themselves.So, the best fruit juice is the one inside the whole fruit.
