Well, we can finally put to rest the question of whether vegetarians get enough protein thanks to a large study thatÂ compared the nutrient profiles of about 30,000 non-vegetarians to 20,000 vegetarians and about 5,000 vegans, 5,000 flexitarians (vegetarian most of the time), and 5,000 pescetarians (no meat except fish).
