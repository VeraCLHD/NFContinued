If that’s how it works, then one might estimate that a reduction in heart rate from an average of more than 70 beats per minute, down to what many athletes have, 60 beats per minute, could theoretically increase lifespan by over a decade.Seems a bit off the wall, but that’s how the scientific method works: you start out with an observation, like these striking heartbeat data, and then you make an educated guess, or hypothesis, that you can then put to the test.
