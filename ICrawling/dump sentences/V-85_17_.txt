The method of cooking and eating the cornmeal as a porridge resulted in an increase in something called resistant starch, which acts in the same way as fiber in the colonâ€”as a prebiotic, a food for our good bacteria to produce those same cancer-preventing short-chain fatty acids.Resistant starch is any starch that resists digestion; is not digested and absorbed in the upper digestive tract (our small intestine), and so, passes down into the large bowel (our colon) to feed our good bacteria.
