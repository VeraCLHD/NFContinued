I put together a 5-part video series summarizing the best science comparing the nutritional content, pesticide risk, heavy metal toxicity, and food poisoning risk of organic versus conventionally raised foods, including a video on practical tips for making your own DIY fruit and vegetable wash: They are all available right now as a video download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 24 (all proceeds go to this charity).
