For example, back in the 60s, an experiment was performed on pregnant women in Motherwell, Scotland, in which they were told to eat a high meat diet in hopes of preventing preeclampsia, a disease of pregnancy.It didn’t work; in fact, the lowest preeclampsia rates I’ve ever seen were among women eating strictly plant-based diets: only one case out of 775 pregnancies.
