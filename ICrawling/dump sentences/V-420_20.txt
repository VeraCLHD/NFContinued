They found similar results pitting nuts against human colon cancer cells, which is particularly useful, since ingested nuts would come in direct contact with colon cancer tumors in the real world, whereas for something like breast cancer, even if nuts suppressed breast cancer cell growth in a petri dish, that doesn't necessarily mean nut consumption would suppress breast tumor growth, since the protective nut compounds might not even get absorbed into the bloodstream.
