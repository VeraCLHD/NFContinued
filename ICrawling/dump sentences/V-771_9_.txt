In the study you were considered disabled if you couldn’t walk a quarter mile, couldn’t walk up 10 steps, couldn’t stand or sit for two hours without having to lie down, or couldn’t stand, bend, or kneel without using special equipment.Using those criteria, we live one year longer, but in less than just one decade, we not only have more years with serious disease, and more years unable to function.
