If you’re a 70 pound 10-year-old, lead still isn’t a problem drinking green tea, but the safe caffeine intake for children is probably only down around three mg per kg, which would limit you to about four cups a day, though I wouldn’t add more than two spoonfuls of Japanese green tea to a child’s smoothie for caffeine reasons and more than one of Chinese green tea for lead reasons.
