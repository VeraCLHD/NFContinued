Endocrine disrupting chemical pollutants can be found in meat and fish (even organic), and may be linked to early onset puberty, increased obesity risk, and lowered testosterone levels.Specific types of endocrine disrupting chemicals include: fire retardants, which may be carcinogenic and impair neurobehavioral development, xenoestrogens which can build up in animal fat and may reduce male fertility, and endocrine-disrupting alkylphenols (mostly found in fish), which may be linked to a rise in allergic diseases.Sex steroids naturally found in all animal products (but may be particularly high in pregnant cowâ€™s milk) may increase cancer risk.
