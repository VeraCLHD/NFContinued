Of course, smoking is hugely damaging to health; any benefit derived from a reduction in risk of Parkinson’s disease is far outweighed by the increased risks of cancer, heart, and lung disease, but this shouldn’t stop us from evaluating tobacco components for possible neuroprotective effects, and nicotine may fit the bill.If nicotine is the agent responsible for the neuroprotective effects, is there any way to get the benefit without the risks?
