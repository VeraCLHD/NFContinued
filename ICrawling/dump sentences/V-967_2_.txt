That’s like the tobacco industry complaining that the people at the American Lung Association are biased against smoking.Because cheese is one of the top ten contributors of sodium in the American diet, the National Dairy Council stood shoulder to shoulder with Big Salt.Sure, reducing sodium intake would save the lives of up to 92,000 Americans a year, but you Dietary Guidelines Committee people just don’t understand; salt is needed to maintain the expected flavor, body, texture, and shelf life of cheese.
