The food associated with the greatest exposure to phthalates was poultry consumption.So, for example, in one analysis, while total dairy consumption was significantly associated with one of the phthalate chemicals, it was the eggs and the poultry consumption, in particular, that was a significant predictor of levels of MEHP, as well as total phthalates.This is consistent with what’s been found measuring phthalate levels directly in foods.
