I talked about some of the test tube studies comparing health-related properties of organic vs. conventional foods—higher antioxidative and antimutagenic activity as well as better inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, but in terms of studies on actual people rather than Petri dishes, there isn’t much out there.Why can’t you just compare the health of those who buy organic to those who don’t?
