Data derived from randomized clinical trials have convinced some influential experts, such as Harvard’s Chair of Nutrition, that we should shoot for this kind of range—levels that about nine out of ten people fail to reach, because it may necessitate taking between 1,800 and 4,000 units a day.The Institute of Medicine, however, considered blood levels of 50 to be sufficient, and, therefore, only recommended 600 to 800 units a day for those with little or no sun exposure, because they were only considering bone health.
