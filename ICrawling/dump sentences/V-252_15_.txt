No significant association was found between coffee consumption and the risk of hip fracture, though tea consumption may actually be protective against hip fracture, though it appears to have no apparent relationship with fracture risk in general.There are certain populations in particular whoÂ may want to stay away from caffeine; for example, those with glaucoma, and possibly even those with a family history of glaucoma.It goes without saying that people who have trouble sleeping might not want to imbibe.
