Dairy products also contain cholesterol, trans fats, endotoxins, Neu5Ge and choline, all of which may raise the risk of inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and increased overall mortality risk.The hormones in dairy products (including skim milk) may promote acne and also contribute to risk of premature puberty, multiple pregnancies (which are riskier to both mother and children), breast cancer, prostate cancer, other hormone-dependent cancers, declining sperm counts, excess estrogen and heart disease.Industrial toxins such as dioxins, flame-retardant chemicals, PCBs, and perfluorochemicals in the dairy supply may in part account for the relationship between dairy intake and increased risk of cancer, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, lower testosterone levels and obesity.
