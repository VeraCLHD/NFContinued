Our tongue bacteria take these nitrates, and convert them into nitrites, which are then re-swallowed, absorbed again, and then make their way to our cells, and then converted into a third compoundâ€”nitric oxide, which then acts on the proton pump to either reduce the slippage, or plug up the leaks, or even take the place of oxygen in the whole contraption.
