Compared to healthy controls, subjects with asthma had lower whole blood levels of total carotenoids, and each of the individual phytonutrients they measured: cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene compared to healthy controls.So the accumulating evidence does suggest that diet has an influence in modulating the response of the lung to inhaled allergens and irritants, but wait a second, it is possible that the reduced carotenoid levels in asthma are a result of increased utilization in the presence of excess free radicals.
