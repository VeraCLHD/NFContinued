Antioxidants protect against oxidative stress, though, and so our lung lining contains a range of antioxidants our body makes itself, as well as those obtained from our diet, particularly from fruits and vegetables.In fact you can even quantify the level of oxidative stress in people by measuring their exhaled breath, which drops as they start eating more fruits and vegetables, then drops further when they combine more plants with less animal foods.So do those with asthma really have lower levels of antioxidants than people without asthma?
