They had the study subject chug down about 8 and a half cups of tea, or just drink water at their leisure, so they peed a lot more with the tea, so the aluminum content was no different tea versus water, suggesting that gross aluminum absorption from tea is unlikely and that only little aluminum is potentially available for absorption.So though as few as 4 cups of tea could provide 100% of oneâ€™s daily aluminum limit, the percentage available for absorption in the intestine may be less than 10%.
