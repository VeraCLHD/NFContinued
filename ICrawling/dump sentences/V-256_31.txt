Imagine if we took people literally dying from out-of-control high blood pressure, so called malignant hypertension—where you go blind from bleeding into your eyes, your kidneys shut down, your heart fails, and then you withhold from these patients blood pressure medications so their fate is certain death, and then put them on a Yanomamo level of salt intake, a normal-for-the-human-species salt intake, and if instead of dying, they walked away cured of their hypertension—that would pretty much seal the deal.
