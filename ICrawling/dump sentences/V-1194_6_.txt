A major recent review found that compared to those eating less than an apple a day, those eating just one or more had less risk of oral cancer, less cancer of the larynx, less breast cancer, less colon cancer, less kidney cancer, and less ovarian cancer.This makes sense, given new research showing, for example, that apple peels have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative effects on human cancer cells in a Petri dish.
