The first study to emphasize how fruits and vegetables could affect energy density and food intake was conducted more than 30 years ago.Researchers were able to cut peopleâ€™s caloric intake nearly in half, from 3000 calories a day down to 1570 without cutting portions, just by substituting less calorie dense foods, which means lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, compared to a high energy density meal with lots of meat and sugar.
