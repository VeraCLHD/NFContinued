Just a few servings a week – about the size of two small handfuls – may boost longevity.Despite widespread assumptions that eating lots of nuts leads to weight gain, recent studies show that frequent nut consumption does not seem to affect body weight, body mass index or waist circumference.Data gleaned from the Harvard Nurse’s Study indicates early nut consumption may prevent breast cancer, and a follow-up study of the daughters of those nurses confirmed the findings: that is, those who ate more fiber and nuts during adolescence, like peanut butter, nuts, beans, lentils, soybeans or corn, had a fraction of the risk for fibrocystic breast disease, which is a marker for increased breast cancer risk.
