I know a lot of moms are concerned about exposing their children to mercury-containing vaccines, but if they just ate a single serving a week, or less, of fish during pregnancy, the latest data shows their infants end up with substantially more mercury in their bodies than getting injected with up to six mercury-containing vaccines.But, with a two-month half-life, within a year of stopping fish consumption, your body can detox nearly 99% of the mercury.
