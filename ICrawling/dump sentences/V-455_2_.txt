Cholesterol is what our body makes estrogen out of, it’s packaged into LDL, which we saw appeared to increase proliferation of breast cancer cells, decrease patient survival, and it’s a major component of lipid rafts.Compared with their normal counterparts, cancer cells have higher levels of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in their plasma membrane, which may be important for cancer cell survival, as well as serve in human cancer development in terms of tumor migration and invasion.Elevated levels of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts have been found in breast cancer cells, and the thought is that reducing blood cholesterol levels may disrupt lipid raft formation and thereby inhibit breast cancer development.
