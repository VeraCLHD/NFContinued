Well, animal proteins tend to have more sulfur-containing amino acids like methionine, which bacteria in our gut can turn into the toxic rotten-egg-smell gas, hydrogen sulfide.Emerging evidence suggests that sulfur compounds may play a role in the development of ulcerative colitis, the chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the colon and rectum characterized by bloody diarrhea.The first hint as to the importance of our gut flora was in the 1970s when analyses of stools showed that their bulk was made up of mostly bacteria, not undigested material.
