Some foods we may want to avoid to protect our lungs include processed meat, the artificial butter flavoring diacetyl (which has been linked to serious lung disease in microwave popcorn consumers), foods cooked using high temperature cooking methods, and even the fumes generated by frying meat may raise the risk of respiratory diseases.A whole-food, plant-based diet may help prevent and treat COPD, and help prevent asthma and improve lung function in asthma patients.
