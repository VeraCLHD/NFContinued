The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association was not happy about the findings of the EPIC study, one of the largest studies on human nutrition ever performed—which, as we’ve seen recently, found that those who eat any kind of meat go on to gain significantly more weight than those who eat less—even eating the same number of calories.One of the beef association’s speakers wrote to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, complaining that “Meat intake’s influence on body fatness cannot be assessed without measurement of body fat.”
