This is one of the ways someone who’s allergic to fish could get triggered by just eating chicken.Reminds me of “pork-cat syndrome,” where your mouth can get all itchy eating bacon, in people with cat allergies, because of an “allergic cross-reaction” between cat skin and pig-blood proteins.Anisakis worms are found particularly in cod, anchovies, and squid, and can also cause chronic hives and intractable chronic itching.
