Kind of like what you see with cervical cancer, in which the causative virus is not just found in the cancerous tissue, but also the precancerous tissue, and the normal tissue surrounding the malignant tumor.If bovine leukemia virus is really causing thousands of cases of breast cancer every year, then, hey, since it’s a retrovirus, maybe some of the antiretroviral therapies (like some of the AIDS drugs) may be able to counter the virus—but, best to not get infected in the first place.The cattle industry appeared more concerned about “consumer confidence” than consumer cancer.
