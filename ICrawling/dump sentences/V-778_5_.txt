Well, a recent in vitro study looking at two different lines of cervical cancer cells found that green tea phytonutrients appear to open cans of cancer, whoop-ass, but in terms of diet, what’s important is that the phytonutrients in green tea appear protective, not only when applied topically to cervical lesions, but orally, as well—suggesting that high consumption of green tea could either reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, or delay the progression of precancerous lesions to cervical cancer.
