Boys who eat more meat in childhood may be more likely to develop abdominal fat streaks, putting them at greater risk for heart disease.On the other hand, plant foods may have slimming effects (as with beans such as soy, and nuts) and enhance abdominal fat loss from exercise (as with green tea), though some plant foods, such as grapefruit, have just as much effect on weight loss as water.
