This is the largest study of those eating plant-based diets to dateâ€”89,000 Californians, comparing non-vegetarians to so-called semi-vegetarians or flexitarians (eating meat more on a weekly basis than a daily basis); compared to those who eat no meat, except fish; compared to those who eat no meat at all; compared to those who eat no meat, eggs, or dairy.
