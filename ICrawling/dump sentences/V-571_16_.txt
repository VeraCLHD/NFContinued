Thirty-three women suffering from painful periods were placed on a vegan diet for two cycles, and experienced “significant reductions in menstrual pain duration” [from four days down to three days], and a significant reduction in “pain intensity,” as well as an improvement in symptoms of PMS, like bloating.This was a crossover study, so after two months eating vegan, the women were supposed to go back to their regular diets, to see if the pain would return.
