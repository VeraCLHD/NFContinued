New science suggests, though, that itâ€™s even simpler and quicker than I described.If you look at other sprouts, their antioxidant phytonutrients appear to peak around sprouting day five, up to 10-fold higher than day two, but the sulforaphane content in broccoli sprouts appears to peak at around 48 hours, so 2-day-old sprouts may be even better.For consumers who do not enjoy eating broccoli, or broccoli sprouts, but still want the benefits of the broccoli phytonutrients, what about all of the different broccoli supplements on the market?
