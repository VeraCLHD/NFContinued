If thatâ€™s how regular mushrooms roll, then think how good the exotic varieties may do.So they put them to the test, comparing regular mushrooms to wood ear, crimini, oyster mushrooms, Italian brown, enoki, button mushrooms (which are just baby versions of regular white mushrooms), stuffing mushrooms (which are just big white mushrooms), shiitake, chanterelle, and portobello.We already know what this one is here.
