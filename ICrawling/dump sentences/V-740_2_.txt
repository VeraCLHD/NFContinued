The purpose of the studies was to determine the effect of a 21-day Daniel Fast on both biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress, as well as the efficacy of the Daniel fast to improve markers of the lion’s den of metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk.No surprise that a diet composed of whole plant foods improves several risk factors for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, as well as an improvement in selected biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress—including metabolites of nitric oxide, which I’ve talked about before.
