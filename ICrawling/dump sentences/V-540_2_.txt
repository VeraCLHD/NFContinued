The reason you’ll only hear that egg industry claim on websites and TV shows, and never in an ad, or on an egg carton, is because there are laws against false and misleading advertisement that don’t allow the industry to say eggs contain lutein, because there’s such an insignificant amount.This is an email retrieved through the Freedom of Information Act from the head of the USDA’s Poultry Research and Promotion Programs, reminding the egg industry that they can’t mention lutein in an egg ad.
