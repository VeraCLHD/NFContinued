“Numerous studies have suggested a decrease in atherosclerotic disease risk [heart disease, our #1 killer] in vegan and vegetarian individuals compared to omnivores; [but, we’ve just assumed this was due to reduced intake] of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat…”But, what these researchers found was that within 24 hours of carnitine consumption—eating a sirloin steak, taking a carnitine supplement—certain gut bacteria metabolize the carnitine to a toxic substance called trimethylamine, which then gets oxidized in our liver to TMAO (trimethylamine-n-oxide), which then circulates throughout our bloodstream.The way we know it’s the gut bacteria that’s doing it, is that if you give people antibiotics to wipe out gut bacteria, you can apparently eat all the steak you want without making any TMAO.
