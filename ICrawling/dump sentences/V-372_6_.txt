There are social, environmental, economic, food security, and biodiversity arguments pro and con about GMOs, but those are outside my area of expertise so I’m going to stick to food safety, and as a physician I’m a very limited veterinarian, in that I only know one species, human beings, so will skip the lab animal data, which may inform what to feed one’s pet rat, but not necessarily what to feed one’s family.
