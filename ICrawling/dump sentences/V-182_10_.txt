One of the reasons plant foods tend to be less acid-forming than animal foods is because acid is produced by the sulfur in the protein, and thereâ€™s less in plant proteins.So, the more important determinant of the effect of dietary protein on kidney disease progression is the quality of the ingested protein (in other words, whether it induces acid production like most animal protein, or base production like most fruit and vegetables), rather than the quantity of protein ingested.Since American diets are largely acid-producing, because they are deficient in fruits and vegetables and contain large amounts of animal products, changing from a standard American diet to a vegan diet may improve acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease.
