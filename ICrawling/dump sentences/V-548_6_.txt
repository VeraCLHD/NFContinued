So, the thinking is that lower methionine intake leads to less free radical production—the so-called “reactive oxygen species,” which slows the rate of DNA damage, which then would slow the rate of DNA mutation, slowing the rate of aging and disease—thereby potentially increasing our lifespan.There are three ways to lower methionine intake: caloric restriction (they call it dietary restriction here); meaning, like, you cut your intake of food in half—for example, only eating every other day.
