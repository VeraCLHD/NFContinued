There was a significant improvement in a number of clinical variables, including most importantly, measures of lung function, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, physical working capacity, as well as a significant drop in sed rate, and IgE, which are allergy associated antibodies.Bottom line, they started out with 35 patients who had suffered from serious asthma for an average of 12 years, all receiving long-term medication, 20 including cortisone, were subjected to vegan food for a year, and in almost all cases, medication was withdrawn or drastically reduced, and there was a significant decrease in asthma symptoms.Despite the improved lung function tests and lab values, the placebo effect obviously canâ€™t be discounted since there was no blinded control group, but the nice thing about a healthy diet is that there are only good side effects.
