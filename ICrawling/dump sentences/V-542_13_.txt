To prevent heart disease, you really have to get down to a total cholesterol of around 150—the average cholesterol of those eating diets composed exclusively of plant foods, not just grapefruits.Even though grapefruits alone don’t do much, the researchers suggest that people might be more likely to stick with them than cholesterol-lowering drugs, noting that most people with heart disease stop taking their statin drugs within a couple years, because of the adverse side effects, whereas grapefruit alone don’t have any side effects.
