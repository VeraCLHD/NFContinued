However, this age-related decline in cerebral blood flow can become critical to brain cell survival if an additional burden further lowers flow.This reduction of blood flow can starve the brain of oxygen, cause silent little mini-strokes and brain atrophy—the cumulative effects of which appear to play a pivotal role in accelerating and augmenting the development and evolution of Alzheimer’s disease.If you look at the amount of atherosclerosis in the arteries that specifically supply blood to critical memory and learning centers of the brain, this is the amount of severe atherosclerosis one sees in healthy non-demented controls compared to those with Alzheimer’s disease.
