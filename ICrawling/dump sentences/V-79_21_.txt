But, most were eating fishes; already getting preformed DHA in their diet.And so, general population studies like this, that found no benefit, can’t fully inform us about the role of DHA in brain health—any more than giving half of these people oranges, finding no difference in scurvy rates (zero in both groups), and concluding that vitamin C plays no role in scurvy.In 2013, for the first time, DHA supplementation was found to improve memory and reaction time among young adults who rarely ate fishes.
