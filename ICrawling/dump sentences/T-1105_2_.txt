Studies have found that patients typically credit Lipitor and the other statins to be about 100 times more effective than they actually are in the prevention of heart attacks.In reality, the best that statins may do is to lower oneâ€™s absolute risk of a heart attack by 3.1% over a span of 6 years.Up to one-third of patients on statins like Lipitor have adverse reactions, which include effects on the liver, kidneys, and muscles; abdominal pain; nausea, constipation, and dizziness; flushing; and skin and neurological disorders.
