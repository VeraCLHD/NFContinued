Toxins like arsenic, lead, mercury, dioxins, PCBs, and even DDT (banned decades ago) have bioaccumulated in seafood, poultry, dairy, eggs, and other animal products and pose threats to human health.Cooking does not destroy the toxins or drugs that have bioaccumulated in food.The USDA, FDA, and EPA are supposed to test for these contaminants, but the Inspector General found that the national residue program is not accomplishing its mission of monitoring the food supply for harmful residues.
