Dr. Holick bases this assertion on data like this—a graph not of rickets risk, but of colon cancer risk versus vitamin D levels—suggesting that the Institute of Medicine’s 20 is good, but 30 or more may be even better, if you’re considering vitamin D from the cancer prevention angle, instead of just strictly skeletal health.There are similar graphs for breast cancer risk, multiple sclerosis, and other conditions linked to vitamin D status.
