According to the World Health Organization, the provisional tolerable weekly intake—our best guess at a safety limit for aluminum, is 2 mg per healthy kilogram of body weight per week, which is nearly a milligram per pound, so someone who’s around 150 pounds probably shouldn’t ingest more than 20 mg of aluminum per day, up to a fifth of intake may come from beverages so what we drink probably shouldn’t contribute more than about 4mg a day, which is the amount found in about 5 cups of green, black, or oolong tea.
