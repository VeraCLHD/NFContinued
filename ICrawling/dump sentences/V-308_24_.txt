Obesity leads to insulin resistance, and our blood sugars start to go up, so our pancreas starts pumping out more insulin to try to force more sugar into our muscles, and eventually the fat spills over into the pancreas as well, killing off the insulin-producing cells, and we’ve got diabetes–in which case we may have to start injecting insulin at high levels to overcome the insulin resistance, and these high insulin levels promote cancer.
