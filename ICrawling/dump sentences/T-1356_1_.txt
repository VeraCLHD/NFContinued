Organ meats also tend to be high in heavy metals, as well as the amino acid ergothioneine.In the ongoing quest to determine the cause of Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have noted that victims of the disease have higher levels of copper in their blood, in their brain, and in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding their brain.Metals like iron and copper are strongly concentrated within the plaques and tangles that are the hallmark of the Alzheimer’s brain, and organ meats and shellfish are the richest food sources of copper.
