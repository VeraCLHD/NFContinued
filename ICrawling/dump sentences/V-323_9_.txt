And other studies have suggested that frequent nut consumption may indeed extend life–for example, the Harvard Health Professionals studies, involving a whopping three million person-years of follow-up over decades, found nut consumption associated with fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease, respiratory disease, and most importantly, fewer deaths overall, confirmed by all the other big major prospective studies, as of 2014, with a new one just published: 17,000 people followed for five years, and those who ate nuts had less than half the risk of dying.Maybe this is just because people may eat nuts instead of meat, eggs, and dairy, and that’s why they live longer?
