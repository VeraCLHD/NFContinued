In Alzheimer’s, it’s the protein amyloid beta; in Creutzfeldt–Jakob and Mad Cow disease, it’s prions; in Huntington’s, it’s a different protein; and in Parkinson’s disease, a protein called alpha synuclein, and a variety of pesticides—8 out of the 12 they tested—were able to trigger synuclein accumulation in human nerve cells, at least in a petri dish.The buildup of synuclein may play a role in killing off specialized nerve cells in the brain—70% of which are gone by the time the first symptoms arise.
