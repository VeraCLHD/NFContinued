On the basis of these findings, the rate of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia will continue to rise unless dietary patterns change to those with less reliance on animal products.This is consistent with data showing those who eat vegetarian appear two to three times less likely to become demented, and the longer one eats meat-free, the lower the associated risk of dementia.Globally, the lowest validated rates of Alzheimer’s in the world are rural India, where they eat low meat, high grain, high bean, high carb diets.
