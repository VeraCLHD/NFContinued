Interestingly, the fructose found in up to 20 servings of whole fruit daily does not appear to raise blood pressure.In one study of rural Kenyans, the traditional diet of whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafy vegetables resulted in not a single case of arteriosclerosis among 1,800 individuals.Among rural Chinese residents who adhered to a traditional plant-based diet, blood pressures of 110 over 70 were the norm for teenagers as well as seniors in their 70s, defying the oft-held belief that blood pressures rise as a result of normal aging.The largest ever study of diet and blood pressure risk involving 89,000 Californians found a drop in blood pressure, along with diabetes and obesity rates, that correlated with volume of plant foods consumed.
