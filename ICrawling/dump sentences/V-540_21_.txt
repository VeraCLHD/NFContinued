We used to think the extra choline was okay for the 99%, but not anymore.Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic found dietary choline, found predominantly in “eggs, milk, liver, red meat, poultry,…and fish” (after it is converted in our gut to trimethylamine, and oxidized in our liver to form trimethylamine oxide), may contribute to plaque buildup in peoples’ arteries, and set us up for heart disease, stroke, death, and, if that’s not bad enough, open-heart surgery.The good news is that this may mean a new approach to prevent or treat heart disease—”the most obvious” of which would be “to limit dietary choline intake.”
