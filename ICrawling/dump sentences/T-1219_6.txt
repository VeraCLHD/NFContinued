Examples of potentially harmful by-products created in our gut from a diet rich in animal products include: hydrogen sulfide, which can be produced in the colon through putrefaction of meat and may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease; secondary bile acid, which may increase the risk for certain cancers, and Trimethylamine (TMA), a fishy smelling compound that is a by-product of choline, found in eggs, milk, liver, red meat, poultry, and fish, and may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.
