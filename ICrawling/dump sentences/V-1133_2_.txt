I got an email from someone last year saying that Dr. Joel Fuhrman told his patients to stop eating raw mushrooms, out of fear of a natural toxin in regular white mushrooms called agaritine, which is essentially destroyed by cooking.Now, I get crazy emails all the time about doctors spouting all sorts of nonsense, but I have tremendous respect for Dr. Fuhrman, so I took it seriously enough to research the topic.
