Enzymes called sirtuins wrap the DNA around the histone spools, and by doing so, silence whatever genes were in that stretch of DNAâ€“hence their name SIRtuins, which stands for silencing information regulator.Although they were discovered only about a decade ago, the study of sirtuins has become one of the most promising areas of biomedicine, since they appear to be involved in promoting healthy aging and longevity.
