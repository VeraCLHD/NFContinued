Numbers 2 and 5 are probably the safest—high density polyethylene and polypropylene.But you don’t want to microwave even “microwave-safe” plastic, and I would encourage people to move to glass Tupperware®, and glass or stainless steel water bottles.BPA is used in the lining of food cans, but thankfully, very little seems to leach into the food—even from acidic foods, like canned tomatoes.
