Burkitt saw disease rates skyrocket after populations went from eating whole plant foods to refined plant and animal foods, but instead of telling people that we should go back to eating whole plant foods, he was so convinced fiber was the magic component, his top recommendation was to eat whole grain bread—but they never used to eat any kind of bread in Uganda— and sprinkling some spoonfuls of wheat bran on your food.But studies to this day associating high fiber intake with lower risk of disease and death relate only to fiber from food intake rather than from fiber isolates or extracts.
