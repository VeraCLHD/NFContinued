Increased dietary cholesterol intake may result in increased breast cancer risk, and may at least partially explain the benefit of a low-fat diet on lowering human breast cancer recurrence.Though data has been mixed, the largest study to date found a 17% increased risk in women who had cholesterol over 240, compared to women whose cholesterol was under 160, though they cannot rule out that there may be something else in cholesterol-raising foods thatâ€™s raising breast cancer risk.Tumors suck up so much cholesterol that LDL has been considered a vehicle for targeting antitumor drugs to cancer cells.
