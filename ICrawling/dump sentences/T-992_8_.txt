Breast-feeding mothers consuming fenugreek seed should be aware that this may cause a maple-syrup-like smell to infant sweat, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of a serious congenital disease, branched-chain ketoaciduria, a condition which also makes the infant smell sweet.Should one be unable to personally breast feed, feeding infants with human milk from another source show identical health benefits.
