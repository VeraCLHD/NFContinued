Short-chain fatty acids, like acetate and butyrate, function to suppress inflammation and cancer, and our gut flora on plant-based diets produces more than on animal-based diets.Other microbial metabolites, such as secondary bile acids, promote the development of cancer, and with a significant increase in bacterial enzyme activity to create these secondary bile acids on an animal-based diet, no surprise thereâ€™s a significant increase in carcinogens like DCA, a secondary bile acid known to promote DNA damage and liver cancer.
