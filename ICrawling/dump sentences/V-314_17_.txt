I would not recommend injecting nutritional yeastÂ into your veins, no matter how much you like the stuff.Yeast is high in purines, so those with gout, uric acid kidney stones, and new organ transplant recipients may want to keep their intake to less than a teaspoon a day, but for everyone else, is there any downside?
