Basically they designed a study to test two different Mediterranean diets versus a low-fat diet, but ended up studying something very different–in essence, what happens when thousands of people switch from consuming about three tablespoons of olive oil a day, half virgin, to four tablespoons of all virgin, compared to thousands of people who all of a sudden go from eating about half an ounce of nuts a day to a whole ounce, compared to thousands of people who don’t make much of a change at all.
