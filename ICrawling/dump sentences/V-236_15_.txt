Atherosclerosis in the brain is significantly more frequent and severe in those with Alzheimer’s disease.This suggests that strategies proven to delay the progression of artery disease, like plant-based diets, may be useful for preventing or treating Alzheimer’s disease.Of course, autopsy studies are a little late for that; so, to assess the impact of intracranial arterial narrowing on the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, researchers followed 400 folks with cognitive impairment for four years using CT angiography, special CAT scans to evaluate the amount of brain artery blockage.
