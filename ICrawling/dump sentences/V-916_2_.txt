Well, a preliminary study in Poland recently of vegetarian children suggested the benefits of meat restriction may continue after birth—concluding that some elements of a vegetarian diet may promote protection against allergy.And indeed, according to the longest-running study in history comparing vegetarians to non-vegetarians, women who eat meat appear to have a 30% greater chance of reporting chemical allergies, 24% more asthma, 17% more drug allergies and bee-sting allergies, and 15% more hay fever—though in men, meat-eaters just had significantly greater chance of chemical and drug allergies.
