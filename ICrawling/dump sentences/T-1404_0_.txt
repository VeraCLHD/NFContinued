Peanuts are part of the legume family (edible seeds enclosed in pods), and are sometimes called “oilseeds” because their seeds yield oil.Daily intake of peanuts or tree nuts can extend longevity, cut the risk of having a heart attack in half, decrease the risk of dying from heart disease, and help reduce cholesterol.
