One of the reasons beans are so healthy is they contain compounds that partially block our starch digesting enzyme, which allows some starch to make it down to our colon to feed our good gut bacteria.And in fact the inhibition of this starch-eating enzyme amylase just by eating beans, approximates that of a carb-blocking drug, acarbose, sold as Precose, a popular diabetes medication.
