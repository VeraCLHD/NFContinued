Our liver dumps bile acids into the intestine for disposal, assuming our intestines will be packed with fiber to trap it and flush it out of the body, but if we havenâ€™t been eating enough whole plant foods, bile acids can be reabsorbed back into the body, and build up in the breast.Carcinogenic bile acids are found concentrated in the fluid of breast cysts at up to a hundred times the level found in the bloodstream.
