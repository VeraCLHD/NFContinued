The meat industry has considered adding plant foods to meat in order to boost antioxidant levels, though this may make processed meat more carcinogenic.Antioxidant supplements do not appear to have the same benefits as whole foods, and may decrease lifespan.Antioxidants help protect against free radicals and DNA damage, including countering possible DNA damage caused by high-intensity exercise or radiation exposure from air flights.Antioxidants may enhance dental health, protect against skin aging, slow general aging, reduce Alzheimer’s risk, reduce inflammation, maintain male fertility and sexual function, prevent and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prevent and treat asthma, prevent the hardening of arteries, reduce risk for stroke, heart attack, heart disease, and cancer, lower cholesterol, block the formation of nitrites into carcinogens, and increase stool size, and lower the risk of asthma, depression, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, stomach cancer, and esophageal cancer.A daily antioxidant goal in the U.S. for men is 11,000 units a day, while the daily goal for women is 8,000, with no apparent upper limit.
