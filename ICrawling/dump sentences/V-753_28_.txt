What is going on?All the other nut studies in this review were what are called isoenergetic studies, meaning they adjusted the calories to ensure people would stay the same weight—which makes it even more remarkable that in some of the studies, people miraculously lost more weight eating nuts.For example, here, they prepared all the meals; forced people to eat only out of the “Metabolic Kitchen,” in which food portions were calculated to the nearest gram.Both groups were given the same kind of diet, but one group was given handfuls of pecans.
