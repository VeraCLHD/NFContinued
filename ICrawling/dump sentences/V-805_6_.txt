They asked the health food and pharmacy staff what they thought they had, what they should take, and whether they thought they should go see a doctor?Given that type 1 diabetes can be fatal if untreated, the answer to that last question is yes, they should indeed go see a doctor, and all eight out of the eight pharmacists got that right; good for them.But only half (six) of the 12 health food store employees thought it necessary, and two of the six naysayers explicitly advised against going to a doctor—the rationale being that the physician would, quote, “just give them Ritalin,” or miss the true diagnosis—which they felt was something like mold infestation or adrenal exhaustion, which, luckily, they had just the right supplements for, at a bargain—for only up to $200 a month.
