Today, the food industry uses the same tobacco industry tactics: supplying misinformation and twisting the science.The same scientists-for-hire paid to downplay the risks of secondhand smoke and toxic chemicals are the same hired by the National Confectioners Association to downplay the risks of candy, and the same hired by the meat industry to downplay the risks of meat.Consumption of animal products and processed foods cause at least 14 million deaths around the world each year.
