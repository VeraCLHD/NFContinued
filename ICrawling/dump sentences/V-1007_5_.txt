Is that fact or fiction?It appears to be fact.The milk protein casein breaks down in the stomach to produce a substance called casomorphin, which as its name implies, has opioid effects—which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, as species survival may depend on a close maternal bond between infant and mother.The guess is that opioid receptors on the mucus glands in the respiratory tract may respond to the casomorphin from milk, which could potentially “stimulate the production and secretion of mucus from these respiratory glands.”
