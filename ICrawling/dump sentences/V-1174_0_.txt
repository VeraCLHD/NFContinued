That’s about what an interventional study found last year: put overweight meat-eaters on essentially a vegan diet, and they start out at an average of 221 pounds, and lose about 25 pounds a year—ending up at 168 after two years, at the end of the study; an average of 53 pounds of sustained weight loss.So eating veg can counteract the forces that lead to obesity and diabetes—though only the vegans were really in the optimal range.
