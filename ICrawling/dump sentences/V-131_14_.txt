That’s what may be triggering the progression of fatty liver into serious hepatitis, the accumulation of sufficient concentrations of free cholesterol within fatty liver cells to cause crystallization of the cholesterol—one of several recent lines of evidence suggesting that dietary cholesterol plays an important role in the development of fatty hepatitis.In a study of 9,000 American adults followed for 13 years, they found a strong association between cholesterol intake and hospitalization, and death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, as dietary cholesterol can oxidize and cause toxic and carcinogenic effects.
