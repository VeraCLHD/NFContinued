The reasons for this are: 1) “reverse causation”, i.e., the more weight people gain, the more they consume artificial sweeteners to try to offset the weight gain, 2) overcompensation for expected calorie reduction (e.g., having a diet cola with a double cheeseburger) and 3) the appetite-promoting effect of sweet substances on the tongue versus the appetite suppression effect of actual calories in the gut.
