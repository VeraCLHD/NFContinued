A group of scientists recently published a paper describing what happened when they ordered some dioxin from Dow Chemical, grabbed some DDT while they were at it, and dripped the chemicals on some human white blood cells, with and without a variety of phytonutrients, to see if they could have a protective effect.They identified two as the most effective agents in protecting human blood cells from developing these cell toxic effects of dioxin and DDT.
