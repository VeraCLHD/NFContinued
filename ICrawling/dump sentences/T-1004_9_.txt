We now know that animal (not plant) fat, like that found in meat, can increase insulin resistance shortly after ingestion and for hours later, causing blood sugar to rise more than it would have in the absence of animal fat.There is evidence that diabetes can be prevented, and in many cases of Type II diabetes (and some adult-onset Type I) can be resolved, with plant-based diets.
