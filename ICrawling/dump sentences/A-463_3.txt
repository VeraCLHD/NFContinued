My video-of-the-day Preventing Allergies in Adulthood (a follow-up to Preventing Childhood Allergies last week), presented findings from the Adventist Health Study showing that women eating plant-based diets were found to have a 30% lower chance of reporting chemical allergies, 24% less asthma, 17% less drug and bee-sting allergies, and 15% less hay fever, though men eating plant-based appeared to have lower risk only of chemical and drug allergies.
