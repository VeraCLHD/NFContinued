Animal protein sources may also contain hormones and other endocrine disrupting chemicals linked to early puberty in girls and fertility issues in women; Neu5Gc, a foreign meat molecule associated with inflammation and heart disease; and saturated fat and cholesterol, which may explain why plant-based low carb diets donâ€™t appear to have the same associated risks as meat-based low carb diets.Beans, canned, sprouted, or dry, are included in the USDA Dietary Guidelines as a serving option for both the protein and vegetable categories.
