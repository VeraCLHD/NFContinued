To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.Beyond the putative role of nonhuman NeuGC as a potential molecular link between diet, autoreactive antibodies, and the progression of human cancer, let me offer one final tidbit on the evolving NeuGc story: the potentially deadly toxin produced by E. coli O157:H7—that causes the hemolytic uremic syndrome that can shut down the kidneys of children—actually attaches to NeuGc.When we eat animal products, the “assimilation of dietary Neu5Gc creates high-affinity receptors on [the] human gut [lining] and kidney [blood vessels]…” conferring susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and systemic toxicities” of the E. coli toxin.
