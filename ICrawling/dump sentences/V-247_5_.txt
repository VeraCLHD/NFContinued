High saturated fat intake is associated with elevated levels of bile, which is what you tend to see in people with colon cancer, and so both are considered tumor-producing factors in colorectal cancer development, and perhaps breast cancer, as these secondary bile acids can get absorbed into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body.This may help explain the extraordinarily low rates of colon cancer in sub-Saharan Africa, with native Africans putting out just a fraction of the secondary bile acids compared toÂ African-Americans.
