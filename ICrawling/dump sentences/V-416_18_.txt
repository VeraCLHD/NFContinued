A history of acne has been associated with breast cancer risk in women, for example, and prostate cancer in men.So early dietary counseling of teenage acne patients is thus a great opportunity for dermatology, which will not only help to improve acne but may reduce the long-term adverse effects of Western diet on more serious TOR-driven diseases.So just like urologists use erectile dysfunction as an opportunity to save lives by putting people on heart-healthy diets, dermatologists can use acne as a way to save lives by putting people on a cancer prevention diet.So how do you turn acne on and off via dietary manipulation of TOR?
