Though enthusiastically supported by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, of which I’m a proud member, both the California Medical Association and the California Academy of Family Physicians came out opposed, and testified against, a California bill this year that would require physicians to become educated on the subject of nutrition—or, at least, get seven hours of nutrition training anytime in the next four years.One of the members of the committee in which the bill was stuck felt the need to side with the California Medical Association against the bill—perhaps because his number one campaign contributor was the California Medical Association.
