To answer this critical question—was it the plant-based diet specifically, the exercise, or the weight loss—ideally you'd do a study where you randomized people into at least three groups, a control group that did nothing, sedentary with a typical diet, a group that just exercised, and a group that lost weight eating pretty much the same lousy diet, but just in smaller portions.
