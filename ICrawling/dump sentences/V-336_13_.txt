You can feed a dog 500 eggs worth of cholesterol and a stick of butter and they just wag their tail; their bodies evolved from wolves, and are used to eating and getting rid of excess cholesterol, whereas within months, a fraction of that cholesterol can start clogging the arteries of animals adapted to eating a more plant-based diet.Even if our bodies were designed by natural selection to eat mostly fruit, greens and seeds for 90% of our evolution, why didnâ€™t we better adapt to meat-eating in the last 10%, during the Paleolithic?
