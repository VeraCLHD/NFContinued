It’s understandable that the Institute of Medicine chose to act conservatively when bumping up their vitamin D recommendation. An editorial in the American Journal of Epidemiology said it best. Thirty years ago, vitamin A was all the rage, expecting that if we gave beta carotene to people, it would prevent cancer. But instead, it caused even more.Next came the Bs, and I talked about this in one of my previous videos; folic acid supplements, vitamin B9, has since been linked to cancer, as well. Next came vitamin C , which was another big flop. In 1993, it was vitamin E—until it came out that it was shortening people’s lifespans. So when people proclaim vitamin D the new wonder pill, we are right to be skeptical. Maybe vitamin D is the new vitamin A, the new folic acid, the new vitamin C, the new vitamin E—worthless, or worse.Critics of the new recommendations, though, felt that by conservatively choosing a target blood level sufficient only to avoid gross skeletal abnormalities was akin to setting the RDA for vitamin C at just the minimum level necessary to avoid scurvy. I’m sure a spoonful of orange juice worth of vitamin C would be enough to avoid the overt vitamin C deficiency disease scurvy, but no one considers that enough vitamin C for optimum health.
