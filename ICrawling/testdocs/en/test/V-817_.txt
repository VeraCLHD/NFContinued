Glaucoma is a deterioration of our optic nerve, the nerve that connects our eyes to our brain, and is second only to cataracts as the world’s leading cause of blindness. The weird thing is that we still don’t know what causes it, and so there’s a desperate search for environmental or dietary influences.The most protective dietary component, decreasing the odds of glaucoma by 69%—consuming at least one serving a month of collard greens or kale. Just once a month or more. And the silver and bronze medals go to weekly carrot, and then peach, consumption.We think it may be the lutein and zeaxanthin, two yellow plant pigments found mostly in greens, that seem to know right where to go. They hone right in to our retinas, and appear to protect against degenerative eye disease.Lycopene is the red pigment in tomatoes so protective against prostate cancer. Guess where it goes when a man eats a tomato? Straight to the prostate. Beta-carotene in foods may prevent ovarian cancer—builds up in the ovaries. And where does our body need the lutein and zeaxanthin? In our retinas, to protect our eyesight, and that’s exactly where it goes. They not only protect, but improve our vision.Their peak light absorbance just so happens to be just the wavelength of color of our planet’s sky. And so, by filtering out that blue haze, on a clear day standing on top of a mountain, individuals with high macular pigment—lutein and zeaxanthin phytonutrients from greens—may be able to distinguish distant mountain ridges up to 27 miles further than individuals with little or no pigment.To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
