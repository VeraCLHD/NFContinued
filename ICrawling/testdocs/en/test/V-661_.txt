Recently, a study was published of 50,000 African American women, a sadly neglected demographic when it comes to nutritional science and medical research in general, actually: “Fruit and Vegetable Intake in Relation to Risk of Breast Cancer in the Black Women’s Health Study.”Those who listened to mom, and ate their veggies had significantly lower risk of the nastiest type of breast cancer—estrogen receptor negative, because it’s so hard to treat. Any plants particularly protective? Out of all the fruits and vegetables they looked at, two stood out above the rest. Which two do you think those were? They specifically looked at apples, bananas, broccoli, cabbage, cantaloupe, carrots, collard greens, grapefruit, oranges, spinach, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes. And, for those of you thinking, wait a second, you can’t compare apples to oranges—well, they just did! What do you think they found? Although broccoli consumption appeared especially protective in premenopausal women, for women of all ages, winner #1 was collards. No surprise. It’s cruciferous; it’s a dark green leafy. It’s like kale! What’s not to like! So, but, winner #2 was a shocker. Carrots—which Tracye featured on the cover of her great book, along with collards. As one researcher suggested, “A whole-food vegan diet rich in fruits and vegetables, especially if coupled with regular exercise and smoking avoidance, could be expected to have a remarkably positive impact on African-American cancer risk, reversing the increases in cancer risk incurred during the 20th century.”
