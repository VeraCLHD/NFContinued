As I progressed through medical training, I could see the ground was definitely shifting. The conversation moved from treating and reversing individual cases of heart disease, to an overdue requiem for palliative cardiology altogether the year I graduated from medical school. In other words, resolving the whole coronary artery disease epidemic altogether, through plant-based nutrition. So, what’s the latest?Ornish’s first major study, more than twenty years ago, only included 28 patients on his plant-based diet. Twenty-eight patients that would go on to change medicine as we know it forever, but 28 patients nonetheless. Since then, he’s published studies involving the reversal of heart disease in thousands of patients, proving that it can not only work in hippie California, but in Nebraska as well.Now Ornish is not just diet; it’s a combo of a low-fat, whole foods, plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, lentils, and soy; along with moderate exercise—walking a few hours a week—in addition to stress management.Now, other studies have focused exclusively on diet. For example, Neal Barnard’s team recently published the first workplace intervention study: Geico corporate headquarters. A couple months of just educating employees about the wonders of a plant-based diet, along with a few healthier options in the cafeteria, without changes in exercise, compared to a control work site where employees were kept in the dark. And within a few months, with their newly acquired knowledge-is-power, the pounds and inches came off.
