Citrus, particularly lemons, may suppress the growth of cancer cells, and may help to improve the survival rates of some types of cancer. The bioflavonoids in citrus may help reduce muscle fatigue after strenuous exercise, treat dry eye disease, and may increase blood flow enough to warm the hands and feet of those with cold sensitivity. Specifically, the citrus phytonutrient, auraptene, may be effective at reducing the damage caused by industrial pollutants. Orange concentrates are a more concentrated source of potassium than bananas, and the smell of sweet orange essential oil may have anxiety-reducing properties. Citrus in conjunction with iron rich foods and the reduction of tea and coffee may be a better choice for treating iron deficiency anemia than supplements. Citrus and other antioxidants can also be effective in reducing inflammation levels. On the other hand, those eating more sour fruit may risk greatererosion of tooth enamel (especially if teeth are brushed in a softened state).  Sour fruits can enhance the absorption of iron, manganese, and aluminum. Grapefruit may increase the risk of side effects with certain drugs.  Also, the belief that grapefruit has some special fat-burning quality appears to be a myth.
