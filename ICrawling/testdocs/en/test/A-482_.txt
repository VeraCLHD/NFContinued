NutritionFacts.org is the first non-commercial, science-based website to provide daily updates on the latest in nutrition research, presented in short, easy-to-understand video segments. A labor of love brought to life by the Jesse & Julie Rasch Foundation, NutritionFacts.org reached nearly 100,000 people in its first month, thanks in no small part to Kathy Frestonâ€™s glowing review on Huffington Post, and favorable mentions from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and Forks Over Knives, the must-see documentary I had the honor of co-hosting at the D.C. premiere. So far, the most popular new videos were Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score, Antioxidant Content of 3,139 Foods, Pork Tapeworms on the Brain, and Chicken Consumption and the Feminization of Male Genitalia, along with the accompanying blog entry Eating Chicken May Lead to a Smaller Penis. The two other most popular posts were Dr. Oz, Apple Juice, and Arsenic: Chicken May Have 10 Times More and Vegan B12 Deficiency: Putting it into Perspective. Though a new video is added every day, the site launched with hundreds of videos covering more than a thousand topics taken from my annual Latest in Nutrition DVD series (all proceeds to charity). Of the older ones, the #1 Anti-cancer Vegetable video consistently ranks as the most popular (prequel here) followed closely by the Bristol Stool Scale, classifying the fecal form of omnivores versus vegetarians and vegans. Thousands of Vegans Studied made a similar comparative analysis of obesity rates. Videos from my 50-part Harmful, Harmless, or Helpful? series also continue to rank highly, such as Is Vinegar Good For You? Peanut butter? Kombucha tea? So do the ones with practical tips, such as a cheap way to buy goji berries and Cold Steeping Green Tea, highlighting surprising new data on what may be the healthiest way to prepare tea.
