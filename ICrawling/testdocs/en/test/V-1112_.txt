What about blue-green algae supplements?Historically, the concern has been about a neurotoxin called BMAA. Should we continue to avoid blue-green algae? Yes.Previously, the only two places you could find that neurotoxin was in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, and on your health food store shelf, in the form of blue-green algae supplements.But now, it’s been found a third place—in the brains of those dying from Lou Gehrig’s disease. I’d continue to stay away from the stuff.
