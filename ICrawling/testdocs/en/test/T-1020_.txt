Isoflavones in soy foods may help lower cancer risk including ovarian cancer and breast cancer (see also here). Research suggests that girls with a higher dietary isoflavone intake from soy foods are more likely to experience the start of puberty months later than girls with the lowest isoflavane intake. Research has also found that soy isoflavone may help prevent fat accumulation. Eating too much soy may increase circulating IGF-1 levels, though.
