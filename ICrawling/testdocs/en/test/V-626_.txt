Studies dating back to the 30s found that by hooking athletes on a treadmill up to an IV drip of sugar water, you could delay fatigue, and that drinking sugar water could help as well.  So, the sports supplement industry has come up with an array of energy drinks, shots, gels, bars, chews—even sports jelly beans, used (what a coincidence!), by the Jelly Belly Cycling Team. In fact, the Jelly Belly Candy Company paid for a study that found that said sports jellybeans could shave four or five seconds off of a 10K cycling trial, compared to sports drinks or gels.But, what about compared to raisins?
