But if we don’t drink milk, what happens to our bones? Well, a study published this year answered that question, comparing the bone mineral density of long term vegans to omnivores. Buddhist nuns, vegan for up to 72 years, versus same age, same height, same weight, same exercise, omnivorous women—who, because of their dairy consumption, ended up getting about twice as much calcium per day as the vegans. Who had stronger bones? Three choices: vegan stronger, omni stronger, or both the same?Despite the vastly different calcium intakes, same bone density.To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
