Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.A number of recent documentaries have renewed interest in Gerson therapy, a largely diet-based alternative treatment for cancer—invented by the late Dr. Max Gerson about 80 years ago.According to a recent review out of Sloan-Kettering in the journal Oncology, for about $16,000, you can fly to a clinic in Mexico, and spend three weeks consuming “fresh, raw fruit and vegetable juices,”—okay—“eliminating salt from the diet…” So far, so good. And, “taking supplements such as potassium, [vitamin] B12, thyroid hormone, pancreatic enzymes,” and, supposedly, “detoxifying [the] liver with coffee enemas to stimulate metabolism.” I do not dispute that coffee enemas would not be stimulating, but would not recommend them, due to the whole “they could kill you” thing.To their credit, modern Gerson practitioners have moved away from the original tenets of the plan—which included feeding people raw calf liver smoothies—after too many people died from systemic blood infections. After learning of the outbreak, staff at the Gerson Institute decided the policy of drinking blended liver was to be altered, and instead started injecting raw liver instead.But, hey, conventional cancer treatments are no walk in the park, either, right? You do them in hopes that they’ll work. So, how does the Gerson therapy compare? The first formal investigation into the treatment was back in 1947, and in the 65 years since, there’s been about a dozen studies published in the scientific literature. And, most came to the same conclusion—that Gerson therapy is useless, or, worse. In tomorrow’s video, I’ll show you some of the data.
