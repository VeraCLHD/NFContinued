The new and improved NutritionFacts.org is here! Based on everyone’s comments and the mad skills of our web developer genius Christi Richards, the site has been redesigned for clarity, ease of use, and overall awesomeness. We want to make it as effortless as possible to find, watch, and share the now 900+ videos. New features include a FAQ page. In fact one of the most frequently asked questions was whether we have a frequently asked questions page :). Any questions I failed to answer? Please contact me. Since the new look went up on Saturday I’ve already added a new question someone asked: “Why does NutritionFacts.org seem biased against certain foods?” Read my answer on our new Frequently Asked Questions page. Other new pages include: I’d love your feedback. Please have patience while we iron out any last bugs due to the major overhaul. You can help us get there by letting us know about any and all weird website behavior. And if you have any thoughts on how we could improve the site and make it even more useful, please contact us. No feedback is too small or picky! If you like the new look and functionality (isn’t it so much easier to share videos now?!), please consider making a tax-deductible donation to help us to continue to reach even more millions with an evidence-based message of dietary sanity.
