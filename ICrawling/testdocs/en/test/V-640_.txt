Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.Normally, rabies is only contracted by getting bitten by a rabid animal, but case reports have been published of people coming down with rabies without any such history—like these two, from Vietnam. In a truly man-bites-dog story, they both came down with rabies after butchering and consuming a dog or cat.The rabies virus should be killed by proper cooking, but they think it was in the preparation of their brains that may have generated large amounts of virus. The dog’s brains were eaten steamed, but the cat’s brains were pulped with the bare hands to make some special dish. The doctors suggest butchering and consumption of dogs should be really better regulated, as as high as 2% of dogs in slaughterhouses may be infected.  And, about the same percentage has been found infected in China.
