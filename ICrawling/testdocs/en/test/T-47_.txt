Algae based DHA has been found to be bio-equivalent to DHA in fish oil and seems to provide the same benefits without the contaminants (even in distilled fish oil and fish oil supplements for children), which are present in even organic farmed salmon. Blue green algae and spirulina supplements have been found to contain neurotoxins and hepatotoxins. The algae-based EPA and DHA are procured from toxin-free algae, however. Chlorella may have anti-virus effects that combat Hepatitis C. Carrageenan, from a type of red seaweed, is a food additive used as a thickener and fat substitute in a variety of dairy and nondairy products, and may cause intestinal inflammation. Pollution that causes algae blooms may increase exposure to the neurotoxin, BMAA, which may be been linked to ALS (Lou Gehrigâ€™s Disease).
