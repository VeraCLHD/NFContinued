Four million Americans are stricken with Alzheimer’s disease, the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Possible contributing dietary factors include advanced glycation end-products (AGEs or glycotoxins; found mostly in chicken), pork tapeworms, steroid hormones in dairy, blue-green algae supplements, spirulina, copper in meat, the neurotoxin BMAA (found mostly in fish), dark fish (such as salmon), aluminum in cheese, and iron (in supplements). Poor cardiovascular health may clog cerebral arteries, cutting off blood flow to the brain and leading to the development of Alzheimer’s disease.On the other hand, coffee, tofu and other soy foods, vitamin D and B12 supplements, apples, blueberries and strawberries, saffron, turmeric, whole grains and fruits and vegetables with their component phytonutrients, and aspirin naturally found in plant foods may play a role in preventing dementia (and possibly treating). Plant-based diets in general may help prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Exercise too may help prevent and reverse mild cognitive decline.There may be a quick, non-invasive, cheap test involving smelling peanut butter which may help diagnose Alzheimer’s early on, which is good considering neurodegenerative brain changes may begin by middle age.
