It all starts with constipation, and so we’ve got to start young. Why are nearly one-third of our preschoolers constipated? It’s all in the title: "Increased prevalence of constipation in pre-school children is attributable to the under-consumption of plant foods"—and also dairy was found to play a constipating role, as well. The childhood obesity epidemic has gotten so bad in the United States that there are now doctors advocating stomach-stapling gastric bypass surgery for kids. In fact, if the obesity trend continues, all Americans will be overweight by 2050, 100%. And 100% obese by the end of the century. So, what has to change? Well, abdominal girth appears directly related to meat consumption. A third of a centimeter increase in waist circumference for every 10 grams of meat consumed. That means an inch onto our waist for every daily burger—so like one belt notch per burger. But it’s not just about cutting back on meat, dairy, and eggs. In a study just released this year, the diets of hundreds of identical twins were analyzed. Same exact genes, but those eating more plant-based diets had more favorable levels of this hormone, secreted by human fat cells, that helps control weight.
