Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.“Used as a coloring agent in products ranging from cola[s] and beer to gravies and soy sauce, caramel coloring may be the world’s most widely consumed food coloring,” helping to sell over a billion servings a day.“Unfortunately, the manufacture of certain artificial caramel colorings can lead to the formation of carcinogens,” such as 4-methylimidazole, which causes cancer in mice, but not rats, or at least not male rats. But, it’s “unclear whether humans are more like mice or rats in terms of their response” to the carcinogen. To be safe, California officially listed it as a carcinogen, and started requiring “warning labels on soft drinks containing more than 29 [micrograms per can].” The soft drink industry was unsuccessful in opposing the action, so they were forced to reduce carcinogen levels in their products—but only in California. Buy Coke anywhere else, and it may have up to five times the limit.
