Active brown adipose tissue helps burn fat and raise metabolism; intake of arginine-rich foods (including soyfoods, seeds, nuts, and certain beans) as well as peppers with capsaicin can help activate that tissue.  Eating plants may also help speed up metabolism due to greater insulin sensitivity in cells and the boosting of a key enzyme called Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase.
