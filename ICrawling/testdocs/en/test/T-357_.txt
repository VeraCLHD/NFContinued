Various health organizations in Canada, including governmental agencies are responsible for shaping public policy and providing guidelines to inform and protect Canadians. In 2008, Canada was one of the first countries to ban the use of bisphenol-A (BPA) in baby bottles. Health Canada recommended against eating Hiziki, a type of sea vegetable, due to high levels of arsenic that could be harmful to those who consume it. Canada was the first to approve the use of sucralose, an artificial sweetener, and following the approval, rates of inflammatory bowel disease seemed to double. Cyclamate, another artificial sweetener ingredient, is still available in Canada under various brand names such as Sugar Twin, despite some studies suggesting negative health effects. In 2010, an editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal called upon doctors to recommend a plant-based diet to their patients in order to improve bowel function. The Canadian Diabetes Association recommends consuming pulses, which include beans and lentils, for optimizing diabetes control. There have been many studies in Canada examining the links between diet, health, and disease. Research in Canada has covered various topics such as seeing if antioxidant-rich chlorella could be used to improve flu shot efficacy, examining the accuracy of advice given by health food store employees and pharmacists, and helping to uncover the role of neurotoxin BMAA in Alzheimerâ€™s disease. One Canadian study looked at the diets of over 300,000 people, and found that greater fruit and vegetable consumption was linked to lower odds of psychological distress, mental health issues, and anxiety and mood disorders. A clinical trial of dietary fat reduction for patients with precancerous breast changes conducted in Canada found that those who reduced their fat intake experienced significant reductions in symptoms.
