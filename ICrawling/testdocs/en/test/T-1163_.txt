The Federal government spends about 10 million dollars a year to educate people about healthy eating; candy corporations may spend twice as much as that just launching a new candy bar. Sadly, U.S. taxpayer subsidies have resulted in low production costs for unhealthy commodities that in turn mean profit incentives for companies to market more unhealthy foods. Also, vegetables can’t be patented and profitable like new pharmaceuticals, and so there is not a lot of money put into marketing them. Fish oil has been marketed as reducing inflammation. However, this may not be true. Fish oil has been found to contain PCBs and DDT, which can be detrimental to health, despite chemical company ads to the contrary. Arsenic is marketed to poison the parasites with which factory farmed chickens are often infested. The meat industry has advertised that slimming phytoestrogens have been found in animal products, but at quantities up to a thousand times lower than in plant foods. The meat industry advertises that meat consumption is not linked to cancer based on a study conducted over one summer overseen by a for-profit firm paid for by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.
