Lutein is a carotenoid phytonutrient that may promote attractive skin, healthy vision, and may decrease chromosome damage when exposed to radiation (such as when flying). Despite what the supplement and egg industries might say, the best dietary source of lutein is whole fruits and vegetables, especially greens such as spinach and kale.
