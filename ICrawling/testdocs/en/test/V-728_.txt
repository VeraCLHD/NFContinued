You may have seen this recent New York Times story about a rare genetic defect that leads to a type of dwarfism—that’s IGF-1 deficiency. Their growth factor levels are so low they only grow this tall, but they almost never get cancer. Here’s the IGF-1 levels in their nonaffected relatives, compared to those with the condition. Now, let’s look at their respective cancer rates. About 20% of their relatives died of cancer, which is pretty standard. And the percentage of those with IGF-1 deficiency dying of cancer? Zero. Not a single person in the study.Here’s what nonaffected family members die of—the usual; heart disease, cancer, stroke. The folks with IGF-1 deficiency may die of a lot of things—they actually get hit by cars more; were recorded tripping down stairs. So, 20%, death from accidents, but they never died of cancer.So, scientists began thinking, why not have the best of both worlds? Have all the growth factor you need as a kid, to grow to a normal height; but then, as soon as you attain a normal adult stature, keep your IGF-1 levels low. Keep your cell life-and-death balance sheets balanced. And we can do that, through dietary manipulation, which I will cover tomorrow.
