What about this, though? Reports last summer linking tofu to dementia. And here’s the study, plain as day: Tofu intake associated with worse memory. So what do you think? Is that fact, or fiction? Is that fact, or fiction? It’s not only fiction, but the opposite is probably true. Most studies have shown soy improves cognition. But what about this? The study did find tofu to be harmful, but tempeh to be protective. So, it can’t be the soy itself, since tempeh is actually a more concentrated source of soy than tofu. Combined with the fact that data around the rest of the world suggests soy protects memory, this raised the question: what do they put in their tofu in Indonesia? If the journalists had bothered to read the study, they would have seen that according to Indonesian departments of health, formaldehyde is often added to tofu (but not tempeh) to preserve its freshness. Formaldehyde, the neurotoxic carcinogen formaldehyde. This is actually what it looks like. Mystery solved.
