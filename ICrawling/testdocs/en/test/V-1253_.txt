 There are at least six sources of microalgae-based DHA currently on the market. There’s Deva, Omega Zen capsules, Omega Zen liquid, Dr. Fuhrman’s brand, Spectrum makes one, V-Pure brand, and Udo’s Oil makes one, too. This isn't even negotiable for all pregnant and breastfeeding women. Just within the last year, mothers given DHA supplements had infants with significantly better vision at two months, significantly better problem-solving at nine months, and were significantly smarter at four years old—it bumped their IQ as well. Now, we can make DHA ourselves from the shorter chain omega-3s in flaxseeds, walnuts, and a few other sources, but probably not enough for optimum health. Still, flax is amazing stuff.
