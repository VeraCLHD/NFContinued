Broccoli can be considered a dark green leafy vegetable, and may help lower the risk of mouth throat, lung, breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and prostate cancers. Raw broccoli specifically may also help bladder cancer survival. Broccoli may even protect against DNA damage, affect gene expression, and boost liver function. Broccoli is most nutritious when steamed, raw, or microwaved and less nutritious when baked, boiled, pressure-cooked, or fried. Microwaving broccoli for more than two minutes, however, will significantly decrease its nutritional quality. The nutritional content of broccoli, along with that of many other crops, has on average decreased 15% in the past 50 years. Researchers can now measure broccoli consumption through a urine test, something which will help improve the accuracy of broccoli studies. Broccoli is also a good source of antioxidants, although adding some additional herbs and spices, such as mustard seed, to it can dramatically increase the antioxidant level. Broccoli and broccoli sprouts are probably the best food to eat to “detox.” Broccoli may also promote iron absorption due to its high vitamin C content. Eating more than 100 cups of broccoli a day is probably not a good idea. Eating broccoli without chewing after gastric bypass surgery is also not recommended. Broccoli sprouts, when grown at home, are probably the most affordable health food there is in terms of bang for one’s nutritional buck. They are considered safer to consume than alfalfa sprouts. New research shows that broccoli may also help block absorption of toxins in the gut, boost detoxifying enzymes in the liver, and play a role in gut immunity. So with all the upsides of eating broccoli, all the parents are asking: how do I get my kids to eat it? Simple, just call it power punch broccoli or put an Elmo sticker on it.
