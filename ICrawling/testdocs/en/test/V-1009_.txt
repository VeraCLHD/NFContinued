When you look at the nutrition facts label on soy milk, it says it has the same amount of calcium as cow milk. But is it absorbed as well?“Calcium absorption in…osteopenic [meaning low bone mineral density] post-menopausal women: an acute comparative study of fortified soymilk to cows’ milk.” Pretty self-explanatory. What do you think they found? Which works better? Soy milk, calves’ milk, or the same? And the answer is: the same.There is, however, a caveat. When it comes to soy, you’ve got to shake things up. A prior study found that some of the calcium in soy milk settles to the bottom. So, you really only get the amount it says on the label if you give it a good shake before you pour.So, when the carton says shake it up, you shouldn’t do it just because the carton says so, or do it because I say so. You should do it because the science says so.
