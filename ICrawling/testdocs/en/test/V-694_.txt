As I’ve talked about before, to help keep cancer-promoting growth factors (like IGF-1) in check, we need to maintain an adequate, but non-excessive, protein intake. I’ve talked about what was excessive—but what’s adequate? We used to think that the average person needed about .3 grams of protein per healthy pound of body weight—or, for those metrically minded, .66 grams per kilogram. So it was easy; you divide your ideal weight in pounds by three, and that’s how many grams of protein most people should average in a day—the so-called EAR, or estimated average requirement. But, to be on the safe side, they recommended closer to .4 per pound for the RDA.Well, recently, a group of researchers published a paper arguing that there may be fundamental flaws in the ways protein requirements have been calculated in the past, based on some faulty assumptions.
