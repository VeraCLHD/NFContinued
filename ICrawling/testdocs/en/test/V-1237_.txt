We've already learned that apples are one of the healthiest foods around, but which variety is the healthiest? In alphabetical order: Fuji, Gala, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, or Red Delicious? I'll give you a few moments to think. Who votes Fuji as the healthiest apple? Gala??? Golden? Granny? Red Delicious? The healthiest is, Red Delicious—off the charts. But who’s number two? Is Fuji is the second healthiest apple? Gala? Golden Delicious? Granny Smith? Well, it’s not Gala. It’s not Golden Delicious, either. I actually gave you a hint when I asked, “Who's” number two… it's Granny!
