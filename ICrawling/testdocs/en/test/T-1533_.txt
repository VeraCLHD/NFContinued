The 2005 Ornish study indicated that the plant-based diet may be beneficial for reducing and reversing the occurrence of prostate cancer. Some specific foods that may be effective include flaxseed, cranberries, turmeric, and almond milk. The occurrence of prostate cancer may also decrease if the following items are restricted in the diet: the amino acid methionine, choline and cowsâ€™ milk. Benign prostatic hypertrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may be less of a natural consequence of aging, and more indicative of eating an unhealthy diet and not exercising enough. The same kinds of healthy lifestyle interventions that have been shown to be effective at reducing the occurrence of prostate cancer are also helpful in keeping BPH in check.
