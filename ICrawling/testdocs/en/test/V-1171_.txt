What about vegetarians, though? Eating meat shortens our life, but who lives longer? Those eating low meat, or those eating no meat? Three choices: low meat, no meat, or they both live the same. Do you think eating a little meat will help you live longer? Is it like smoking—there’s no such thing as a safe level of meat consumption? Or do you think the latest science says no difference—that you appear to get the same longevity benefit from cutting down on meat as you get from cutting it out? If you said low meat, you’re wrong. But if you said either no meat, or no difference, you’re right, and that’s because it depends on whether we're talking about studies on American vegetarians, or British vegetarians. American vegetarians live longer than healthy meat-eaters, but British vegetarians do not. Why do British vegetarians lose some of their advantage? Lots of theories, but my guess is that it’s because they appear less likely to supplement their diet with vitamin B12-fortified foods or supplements.
