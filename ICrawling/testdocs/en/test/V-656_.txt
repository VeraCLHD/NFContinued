But, it’s not because of the juice in them, but rather, perhaps, primarily what’s found in the peel. Within the last year, half a dozen studies have touted the benefits of apple peels—for example, this one, in the journal Nutrition and Cancer: “The antiproliferative effects of apple peel extract against cancer cells.”We know the more apples we eat, the lower our apparent risk of several cancers. The peels are the really good part, yet are often discarded. For example, apple peel is a waste product of dried apple manufacturing. In one little country, Chile, they throw away 9,000 tons of apple peels a year. That’s like 20 million pounds—what a tragedy! So, these researchers decided to see what we’re missing. Here are two cell lines of human prostate cancer, and two of human breast cancer, growing merrily away in petri dishes. They’re the little black dots you see. They’re blissfully unaware that researchers at the University of Wisconsin were at Whole Foods, buying some organic Gala apples.The peels were thrown in a blender, and a tiny bit dripped on the unsuspecting cancer cells. And then, a bit more, and a little more. And, as you can see, by the end, neither the prostate nor breast cancer cells were very happy about it.
