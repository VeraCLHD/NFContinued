I’m not going to harp on it too much this year, but a major review was just published: 60% of vegans are B12 deficient, because they’re not regularly eating B12-fortified foods or taking B12 supplements every day, or every week. So that means yet another year of horror story, after horror story, one after another. Vegetarians even got a disease named after them! Vegetarian’s myelopathy. People eating plant-based diets must take vitamin B12.
