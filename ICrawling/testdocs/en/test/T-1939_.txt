Vitamin D, specifically D3, appears to be the only supplement that helps the average person live longer. The RDA for Vitamin D is lower, but taking a vitamin supplement of around 2,000 IUs with a meal can raise Vitamin D levels to 30 ng/ml. Vitamin D has been found to improve pain from menstrual periods and greatly reduce respiratory infections.One can get natural Vitamin D from exposure to the sun and/or consumption of mushrooms.
