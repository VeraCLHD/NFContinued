Goji berries may be one of the healthiest dried fruits on the planet due to their high antioxidant content, which may contribute to a longer lifespan. Consumption of goji berries may also be protective against macular degeneration. Goji berries also contain melatonin, the hormone responsible for signaling the bodiesâ€™ readiness for sleep. Perhaps for this reason, the goji berry may improve sleep and benefit those with insomnia.
