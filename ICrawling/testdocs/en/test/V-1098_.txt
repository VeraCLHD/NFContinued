Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.The best fruits for cancer prevention in general are probably berries, which are considered ideal cancer-preventive agents. In fact, there are now seven clinical trials underway to treat cancer and precancerous lesions with black raspberries, for example—by any means necessary, even if they have to stick them up patients’ butts.The preliminary results from that study are actually pretty amazing, though. After nine months of treatment, half of their rectal polyps disappeared. Normally, you have to go in and cut them out—but the berries made them just totally regress back into the body.But, don’t try this at home. They were stuffing so many raspberries up there, 20% of the patients developed rectal fissures. I will spare you the pictures. Therefore, the use of black raspberry suppositories for future trials is “questionable.”
