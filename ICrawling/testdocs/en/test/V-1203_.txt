To really boost our immune systems, maybe we just need to get enough sleep. Or is that a total myth? Fact or fiction: if you don’t get enough sleep, it can impair your immune system. Believe it or not, we didn’t know for certain either way, until 2009. Researchers dripped virus into people’s nostrils—the common cold virus. Now, you’d think if someone squirted virus right up your nose, you’d definitely get sick. But no. It really depends on your immune system. Someone with a cold can sneeze dead in your face—but if you have a good enough immune system, you won’t get sick. So in the study, did it depend on how much sleep they’d been getting? Fact, or fiction? Fact. Those getting enough sleep were three to five times more likely to beat the virus.
