Of course, there are other healthy drinks, too. Consider the Kuna Indians, who live on islands off of Panama—one of the healthiest populations on Earth; 20 times less heart disease compared to us; 20 times less cancer. And it’s not their genes. When they move to the mainland and start eating a typical Western diet, their chronic disease rates skyrocket. Scientists don’t think it’s what they eat, though, but what they drink. What’s their secret? Every day, they drink more than five cups of which one of these? Açai berry juice, cocoa, yerba maté tea out of a gourd, quechua—a fermented drink made out of quinoa sprouts, or, do you think they’re so healthy because they drink so much spirulina? I’ll give you a hint: it’s not because they keep such adorable pigs as pets. What do you think? Well, it’s not the quechua—because there’s no such thing. I just made that up. It’s not spirulina, and maté may actually increase our cancer risk. Nearly all these people drink in this tropical climate is cup after cup of cocoa!
