Sometimes the advice on dietary supplements people are given is worse than worthless. “HIV Patients Seeking Advice from Health Food Stores”—26 stores recommended 36 different products, including some, like garlic, that can critically interfere with certain HIV meds.When the FDA and Health Canada issued advisory warnings to stop taking the herb kava kava, due to one too many cases of fatal liver toxicity, it didn’t seem to affect things much in health food stores.What about “Health Food Stores’ Recommendations for Nausea and Migraines During Pregnancy”? Would health food store employees recommend “supplements contraindicated in pregnancy that could cause significant harm to the mother and/or fetus?” You betcha. And what kills me is that there are pregnancy-safe supplements for nausea, like powdered ginger, that may be effective, yet they were instead advised to take a long list of untested things, including herbs like feverfew and black cohosh, which can cause uterine contractions and possible miscarriage.To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
