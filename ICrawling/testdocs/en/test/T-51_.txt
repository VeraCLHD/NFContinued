A plant-based diet may reduce the risk of allergies. In India, those eating the most fruit and vegetables, rather than supplements (though probiotics and prebiotics have a positive effect on the common cold), were much less likely to report asthma or other allergies. The consumption of red rice, green tea, and especially white button mushrooms may help protect against atopic (allergic) diseases. Listening to Mozart may also reduce allergic reactions. About 1 in 1,000 people may have a wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity may be on the rise, although those who suspect they are gluten intolerant, should first try to improve their diet before going on a gluten-free diet, since many who avoid gluten for symptom control end up having a different disease altogether. Components in meat that may trigger allergic reactions include antibiotics and parasitic fish worms. Seafood and meat consumption were associated with higher prevalence of asthma, pollen allergies, and eczema. There are certain meat allergies that may be triggered by the Lone Star Tick. Dairy has been linked to the recurrence of canker sores, and cowâ€™s milk is a leading allergen. Though monosodium glutamate does not appear to trigger traditional allergic reactions, certain artificial colorings might due to the presence of cochineal, a red coloring derived from insects. Common household chemicals may also cause allergy-related diseases. There is no evidence that pregnant women consuming peanuts results in children with peanut allergies, but 1% of people do report nut allergies.
