Along with the work of Dr. Dean Ornish and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, research from engineer, Nathan Pritikin has shown that plant-based diets can both stop heart disease and even, in a majority of patients, reverse it (see also here, here). Pritikin began reversing heart disease with low-fat, whole food plant-based diets back in the 1970s. Plant-based diets may also reduce benign prostate cell growth and even help reverse cancer growth by lowering circulating IGF1 levels. Combining such diets with exercise may be even more effective in trying to treat cancer.
