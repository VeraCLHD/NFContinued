The immune system benefits from adequate sleep, exercise, and the consumption of plant foods (see also here, here). “Airborne” supplements and nasal zinc gels are not recommended. Foods that may be especially helpful include apples, tea, cocoa, gluten, kale (see also here), and Ceylon cinnamon. Chronic diseases associated with inflammation such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and arthritis may be prevented or even possibly reversed by a plant-based diet, whereas chicken and eggs may play a pro-inflammatory role. Avoiding meat during pregnancy may prevent childhood allergies and parasitic brain infections.
