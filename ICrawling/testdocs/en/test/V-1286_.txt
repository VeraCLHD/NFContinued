So, no Herbalife, no noni juice. There is a beverage, other than water, I do encourage everyone to drink everyday, though, and that is tea. This year, a review was published on the antibacterial, antitoxin, antiviral, and antifungal activities of tea. What more could we want? Anticancer? Done. We conclude that the regular consumption of green tea can protect against cancer. What else could we ask for? How about anti-death? Tea has got that too! Reduced all-cause mortality. Drink green tea everyday, and live, on average, a longer life. This shouldn't really come as a surprise since, after all, it's just dark green leafies in water.I know what some people may be thinking, though. Rather than drink the five cups a day it may take to extend one's life, if it's so good for you, I'll just take some green tea extract pills. Certainly lots to choose from. Not a good idea. Why was there a study about green tea extract pills in the journal Liver Transplantation? Because of the acute liver failure induced by green tea extract.Five cups of tea isn't that much. It's really just one pot of tea. 40 ounces is the size of a typical drinking bottle—less than a Super Big Gulp. 40 ounces is, frankly, 40 ounces. And no, I'm not saying you should drink 40 ounces everyday.There are now dozens of flavored green teas on the market if you don't like the taste of it straight. Just don't put cow's milk in it. This year from the British Nutrition Foundation: "Does adding milk remove the benefits of your daily cuppa" tea? The answer is yes. It seems that cow proteins bind up all the good phytonutrients. None of the soy, rice, or nut proteins in plant-based milks have that same nutrition-cancelling effect.
