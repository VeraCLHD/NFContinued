I realize I’m moving very quickly through all this—I’m just trying to fit in as much of the best new science as I possibly can. It is important, though, to pause and just acknowledge the tremendous dedication, work, energy, and resources these researchers have sacrificed. I mean, imagine what it takes to not only study thousands of individuals, but then follow them for a decade or two. I can hardly keep track of friends that long. Now imagine following a half million people for ten years. The National Institutes of Health-AARP study—the largest forward-looking study of diet and health in history. So what does the largest study ever have to say about meat and mortality? Meat intake means increases in total mortality, cancer mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. End of story. Here’s the title of the accompanying editorial in the American Medical Association’s Archives of Internal Medicine: “Reducing Meat Consumption Has Multiple Benefits for the World’s Health,” calling for “a major reduction in total meat intake.” They do particularly pick on processed meats, but in terms of global crises: “There is a…tsunami brewing, namely, we are seeing the confluence of growing constraints on water, energy, and food [supplies] combined with the rapid shift toward greater consumption of all animal source foods,” which, they note, are “inefficient, wasteful, and polluting.”And this is in a journal of the AMA. Just so readers don’t think they’re biased, though, they note: “The author is not a vegetarian.”
