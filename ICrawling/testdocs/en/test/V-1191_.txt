A common question I get asked when I tell folks to eat nuts every day is: “Which nuts count (in terms of cutting our heart disease risk in half)?” Basically, all nuts count, including peanuts, but excluding chestnuts and coconuts, which really can’t be considered nuts, nutritionally. Last year, though, someone asked me about betel nuts—something I’d never even heard of. It turns out you can find them in Asian markets, advertised as “tasty.”Betel nuts. Harmful? Not harmful, but don’t really have the benefits of other nuts? Or, betel nuts are like any other nuts—helpful? It turns out, evidently, the public health community has known for a long time that betel nuts cause cancer. But only recently did we discover they may shut down our kidneys as well.
