Erectile dysfunction may be an early warning sign for potential cardiac problems, but a plant-based diet could improve both erectile function and heart health as well as increase testosterone (See also here). More specifically, eating pistachio nuts and watermelon as well as avoiding BPA plastics may result in visible improvements. Low-carb diets may be particularly harmful. The same disease mechanisms are involved in women and similarly, female sexual function maybe improved on a plant based diet.
