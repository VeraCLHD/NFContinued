Strokes remain a leading cause of death in the United States. The plaque in our arteries (including the arteries in our brain) is built out of cholesterol. Eggs and brains themselves are the two most concentrated sources of cholesterol. This is one reason why one of the leading experts on strokes said you can eat all the eggs you want—but only if you’re dying from a terminal disease! To minimize risk of stroke, the following appear to be helpful: sleep 7 hours a night, drink green tea, and eat a potassium-rich plant based diet. Moderate alcohol consumption appears to increase the risk of a bleeding stroke but reduce the risk of clotting strokes. Dr. Greger covers strokes in his full-length presentation, Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death, where he explores the role diet may play in preventing, treating, and even reversing our top 15 killers.
