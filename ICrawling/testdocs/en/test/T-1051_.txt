Kidney disease ranks as the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. What may be some foods to avoid in order to keep our kidneys healthy? Due to toxic metal contamination, NeuG5c, alpha-gal, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), meat (including poultry and processed meat), sugar, and high-fat meals should be avoided to maintain kidney health. Similarly, intake of betel nuts or star fruit can potentially shut down the kidneys, and the safety of chamomile tea for those with kidney disease has not yet been established. Â High-temperature cooking may create kidney cancer causing carcinogens. Staying well hydrated, consuming phytates, which are in beans, nuts, seeds, and grains, and plant-based diets in general may help reduce kidney stone risk. Those with certain kidney stones should be cautious about nutritional yeast, turmeric, and beets. To eliminate uric acid kidney stones, drinking at least ten cups of water per day and reducing animal protein and salt intake may do the trick. Overall, plant-based diets appear to boost kidney health. Plant-based, fiber-rich diets may protect against kidney and other cancers, reduce the risk of childhood prediabetes (which can lead to kidney damage) and diabetes, the top cause of kidney failure. No surprise, then, that plant-based diets can be used to both help prevent and treat kidney failure.
