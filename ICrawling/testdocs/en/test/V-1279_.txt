So, turning the breakfast smoothie I described earlier into a chocolate smoothie by adding cocoa powder makes it even healthier. Here's my annual recipe for the year: Dutch processed cocoa (try to find fair-trade, of course), date sugar, frozen dark red cherries, and unsweetened or DHA-fortified soy milk.  Now date sugar is not sugar. It's a whole food; whole dates just pulverized. So that and blackstrap molasses are really the only two healthful sweeteners. So—cocoa, date sugar, frozen berries, and plant-based milk. And you can put the ground flax seeds in for a nutrient boost and to thicken it up. Put that all in a blender, and we have a chocolate milkshake that's actually good for us. Literally health promoting. Meaning the more chocolate milkshake you drink, the healthier you'll be. Take out the berries, and you can heat it up for healthy hot chocolate. Or instead of the soy milk, try silken tofu, and you've got instant chocolate pudding. The more chocolate pudding you eat, the healthier you are. Kids absolutely love it. It's been a good year in nutritional science.
