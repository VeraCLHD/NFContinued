So, essentially, we can group foods into one of four categories. There’s stuff that’s nutritious—but has calories—in the upper right; calories, but no nutrition—junk food; and then, there’s stuff with neither calories nor nutrition. Is there anything that’s nutritious, but doesn’t add any calories? Well, there’s water. That’s good for you, and calorie-free. But how can one add nutrition to the water, though—without adding calories? We can make some tea. Has all the water of water, but as a bonus, is packed with phytonutrients. It’s nutrition, without calories. Every time we drink just water, we are losing an opportunity to get nutrients by drinking tea instead.
