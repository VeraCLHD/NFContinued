What about the artificial flavor, diacetyl—the artificial butter flavor in microwave and movie theater popcorn? Harmful, harmless, or helpful? And the answer is: harmful.There’s even a name for it: popcorn lung, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans, because it can obliterate your airways. It’s given off as vapor when you nuke it. And you know, when workers have to wear gas masks to handle your food, it’s probably not a good idea to eat it.Microwave popcorn manufacturers are now replacing the chemical with real butter. So now, instead of dying of lung disease, we can die of heart disease.
