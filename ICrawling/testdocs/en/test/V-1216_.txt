The only other situation where you can find major nutrition without calories is with spices—cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger—also known as chai tea! Has all the tea of tea, but as a bonus, also contains the single most antioxidant-packed substances on the planet—like cloves and cinnamon. If you want to add some unsweetened soy milk, some erythritol to sweeten it, a spoonful of cocoa powder to make it even more nutritious, and you will end up with a hot, velvety, sweet, spicy, chocolate drink. Hardly any calories, and can have three days' worth of antioxidants per glass. It’s something I drink every day.
