Major causes of liver cancer are diseases such as hepatitis and consuming too much alcohol. But there are plenty of ways to help lower our risk of liver cancer by dietary means. Eating broccoli, cranberries, lemons, amla, walnuts and pecans may lower our risk of liver cancer and cancer in general, as may increasing the amount of phytates in our blood, which are most commonly found in whole-foods such as beans, nuts and grains. Recently, coffee has been shown to decrease the liver cancer risk of those that consume alcohol by 50% (but simply not drinking alcohol is a better solution!). Sea vegetables may also suppress the risk of liver cancer, but be wary of their iodine content and avoid Hiziki (or Hijiki) seaweed and Spirulina. Lastly, it’s best to avoid added sugars, such as high fructose corn syrup and table sugar, as that can lead to fat build-up in our livers.
