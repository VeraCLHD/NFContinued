To snack or not to snack? A review was recently published on the accumulated research about eating frequency, and both weight and health. Maybe we should eat throughout the day, to reduce hunger, increase our metabolic rate, mobilize our body fat. Or, maybe, snacking will just lead us to overeat. What does the science say? What do you think? A few big meals a day, or smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, for weight management and optimal health? According to the best available science, it doesn’t seem to matter. “Overall current evidence does not suggest that manipulating eating frequency greatly benefits weight and health.” What we eat is more important than how often we eat it. If you do like snacking, though, a new study, thanks to the California Prune Board, suggests that (what else?) prunes may be a particularly good choice, given the “satiating power of prunes”—which they found, like with nuts, to compensate for the majority of their calories.
