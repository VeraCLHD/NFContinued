As important as it is for us to eat our greens, we should also eat our beans. We've all heard about how good soybeans are for us, but what about the less exotic pinto bean? Half a cup of cooked pinto beans a day for two months could mean a 20-point drop in our cholesterol. A new wonder drug? No, just pinto beans. Same with baked beans—half a cup of canned vegetarian baked beans a day for two months; navy beans this time, and the same amazing effect. There was a randomized crossover clinical study with a control group and the vegetarian baked bean treatment group. Of all the treatments we have in allopathic medicine—radiation treatments, chemotherapy—a vegetarian baked bean treatment sounds pretty benign. Imagine if there were a pill that could do that, and go good with toast, they'd be making a fortune! Beans are, after all, one of nature's most perfect foods; the whole plant in just one little package. Low in fat, no cholesterol, high in fiber and protein. So just like we can improve the nutrition of any dish by adding greens and other veggies, we can do the same by adding beans. Another study this year showed some remarkable qualities about watermelon. A fruit once dismissed as being, basically, well, water. Now we realize it's a rich source of citruline, which we talked about in a previous year's review.
