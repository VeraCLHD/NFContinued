Five rounds left. Let’s get nutty. Ten different types. Pecans are the chart topper, followed by walnuts, the two healthiest nuts around. First off, though, what’s this one all the way at the other end? It’s not quite in iceberg lettuce land, but it should be embarrassed to call itself a nut. Which is it?Of the remaining eight, which is the least healthy? Do you think almonds are the worst? Brazil nuts? Or is it the cashew? Hazelnuts? Macadamia nuts? Peanuts? Pine nuts? Or do you think it’s the pistachio? And the losing nut is—the pine nut.So pecans and walnuts up here; pine nuts down here. Now I would have guessed almonds would have been number three, but no, they’re down at number five. So which of these are numbers three or four? Pick a nut, and if it’s either number three or four, you get to stay in the game. So, which ones are the healthiest? Brazil nuts? Cashews? Hazelnuts? Macadamias? Peanuts? Or pistachios?If you said peanuts, you’re wrong. If you said cashews, you’re even more wrong. Not macadamias or Brazil nuts, either. The top five healthiest nuts are pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts (also called filberts), pistachios, and almonds.
