Targeting cancer stem cells and protecting DNA doesn’t even scratch the surface of what broccoli and broccoli sprouts appear capable of. Here’s a sampling published just in one random month: anticarcinogenic; anti-inflammatory; another anti-inflammatory; may protect against colorectal cancer; help fight cervical cancer; may protect against sunburn, for goodness sake; and protect cartilage. And that’s just one month in the medical journals.What’s the catch? There has to be a downside.Well, in Turkey, recently, a report of liver toxicity, thought due to juiced broccoli. 56-year-old woman, drinking about three and a half cups of pure broccoli juice a day, for a month.A commentator balked at the assumption that that the broccoli juice per se was responsible for liver toxicity, suggesting that a more likely possibility is that the pesticide residue levels in such a large daily quantity of the vegetable were such that they adversely affected her liver cells.Three and a half cups of juice is equivalent to eating about 18 cups of broccoli a day. 18 cups a day for four weeks; that’s 500 cups of broccoli. Even if it were organic broccoli, 500 cups a month is a lot of broccoli.This was just a case report. Thankfully, formal human toxicity studies have been done. Here, for example, they gave some volunteers a week of broccoli sprout extract, equaling the sulforaphane content of about two dozen cups of broccoli a day, and no problems were found.
