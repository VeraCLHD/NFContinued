What about non-cancer mortality?“The root cause of many chronic diseases in humans is [after all] still unknown. Chickens and turkeys destined for human consumption and their products are infected with a plethora of transmissible agents that cause a variety of diseases in the animals, including cancer, diseases of the nervous system, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, etc.”That’s in the animals, but they “are a potential source of infection for humans. Humans can be infected by direct contact with live or killed birds, their blood and secretions [the so-called ‘chicken juice’ in the package of raw meat], consumption of raw or inadequately cooked poultry meat, or other products, such as eggs and vaccinations…”“We already have serologic evidence [testing for antibodies] that humans are commonly infected with avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses, reticuloendotheliosis viruses and Marek’s disease virus, that cause a wide variety of cancers, neurologic, and other diseases in chickens and turkeys…The question therefore arises as to whether these agents also cause similar diseases in humans—especially those human diseases whose [cause] is currently undetermined.”They figured, look, if it’s going to affect anyone, it would be the poultry workers first. And indeed, they found that compared to the control group, “an excess of deaths was observed for disorders of the thyroid gland, senile and pre-senile psychotic conditions [like schizophrenia], anterior horn cell disease [which is a degenerative spinal cord condition], myasthenia gravis [an autoimmune nerve disease], hypertension, heart disease, diseases of the esophagus, peritonitis [which is inflammation of the abdominal lining], and other diseases of the kidney…” They conclude that this apparent “excess occurrence of disease affecting several organs and systems, [is] probably originating from widespread infection with a variety of microorganisms.”
