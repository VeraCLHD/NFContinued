Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. Once we’ve preserved the pigment in our retinal pigment epithelial cells, we need to keep them alive, which may be where anthocyanin phytonutrients come in. Anthocyanins, from the Greek anthos—meaning flower, and kyanos, meaning blue—blue flower—are natural plant pigments that make pansies look purple, and turns green cabbage into purple cabbage, yellow corn into purple corn, brown rice to purple rice, white potatoes to blue potatoes, orange carrots to purple carrots, and turns blueberries into, well, blueberries, and keeps blackberries black. As we age, our critical RPE layer starts to break down, but we may be able to decelerate that aging with blueberries. Here are human RPE cells in a petri dish exposed to various stressors. The ones bathed in blueberry anthocyanins had fewer free radicals, and a lower proportion of aged cells—suggesting that blueberries and these other red/blue/purple pigmented fruits and vegetables may help prevent age-related macular degeneration. And, blueberries may be especially important for blue eyes, as we saw in an earlier video. Preventing is nice. But, what if we already have a disease like glaucoma, an incurable eye disease in which our optic nerve, which connects our eyes to our brain, starts deteriorating, and we start losing our visual fields? A few years ago, Japanese researchers showed they could apparently halt the progression of disease with black currants. They gave people black currants for six months, significantly boosting the blood flow to their optic nerve. The results suggested that black currants might be “a safe and valuable option.” But, it was not double-blind; no control group. So, I didn’t report it when it was initially published, but, here we go! Finally.
