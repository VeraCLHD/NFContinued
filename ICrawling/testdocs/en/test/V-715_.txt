The problem with edible insects is consumer acceptance. Entomophobia, for which scientists describe “the public’s irrational revulsion and fear of insects…noting that these attitudes are not helped at all helped by government regulations that refer to insect parts as filth, lumping them together with rodent droppings.”Our irrational revulsion has even been called a type of social pollution. “Westerners should become more aware of the fact that their bias against insects as food has an adverse impact, resulting in a gradual reduction in the use of insects without replacement of lost nutrition.” Basically saying, hey, even this is better than getting them hooked on Spam and Twinkies. Not to oversell them, though; edible insects are not without their problems. Your supper can bite back, and dyspepsia has been reported, which is basically like a kind of upset tummy. Numerous reports record intestinal upsets after people have eaten foods containing insects and mites. In three experiments conducted on healthy subjects, ingestion of housefly larvae produced nausea in 83% of volunteers. Maggots? Live maggots? I think they’re burying the lead, here. How about the whopping 17% of people that didn’t get nauseated?
