Fatigue may be a symptom of a variety of illnesses including celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, PMS, depression, fibromyalgia, diabetes, hypertension, and dehydration. Consuming a whole-food, plant-based diet, which is naturally high in antioxidants, may help alleviate fatigue. More specifically, black currants and bilberries may relieve visual fatigue associated with staring at a computer screen all day.Â  As for muscle fatigue, daily citrus fruit, berry, and peppermint tea consumption may help. Caffeine will also lessen fatigue. Neurotoxins found in seafood may cause a chronic fatigue-like syndrome, but chocolate may alleviate symptoms.
