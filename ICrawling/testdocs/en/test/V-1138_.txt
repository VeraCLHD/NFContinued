Normally, I wouldn’t spend so much time on one topic, but people are always asking me about supplements. Let’s try three at a time. Lutein, a phytonutrient found in dark green leafy vegetables; lycopene, found in tomatoes; and selenium, a trace mineral found in nuts and whole grains.Not a single one of these, in pill form, prevented cancer, and one of these three was just found to increase cancer risk when taken in pill form. Which one was worse than just a waste of money, and actually seemed to cause cancer?It was the lutein pills. There’s no getting around it; we just have to eat our greens, which has thousands of phytonutrients in it.Drug companies are never going to find the right combination, but they don’t need to, because Mother Nature did it for us.
