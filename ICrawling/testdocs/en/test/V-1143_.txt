The contaminants I’ve been talking about are just from how polluted our planet has become; it’s not like they’re deliberately adding them to fish. But fish farmers do feed about two dozen human antibiotics to their fish, to keep them alive in such stressful, overcrowded environments. They also had to figure out a way to make greyish fish flesh look pink, which it is naturally when pulled out of the ocean. So the aquaculture industry feeds farmed fish artificial coloring. This is from the drug company Roche. Fish farmers get to pick out the color they want to dye their flesh, like paint chips. The possible human health consequences? You can get a rare condition called gold dust retinopathy, as the coloring potentially crystallizes in the back of our eyeballs, which can lead to problems down the road.
