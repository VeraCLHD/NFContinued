Garlic has a range of potential health benefits. For example, it may be given as supplemental treatment for pneumonia. Garlic may also play a role in preventing premature birth, reducing prostate enlargement risk, increasing the body’s ability to absorb minerals, protecting against radiation damage, and suppressing breast cancer cell growth. Garlic ranks among the top vegetables in reducing cancer risk. Garlic, however, may interfere with certain HIV medications.
