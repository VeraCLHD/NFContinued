Let me start by saying this one is not for the squeamish. For years, I’ve shared many a foodborne malady. When people think foodborne illness, they tend to think of tummy flu. Not toxic megacolon, or sexually transmitted fish toxins, or any of the other bizarre case reports I run across of things one can contract at the dinner table.Well, published recently in the official CDC journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, I think I found something that takes the cake. It wasn’t the sushi worm found living in someone’s stomach, or a swallowed fish bone that came poking out. No, it was Linguatula serrata, tongue worm in human eye.Evidently, if we prefer our viscera poorly cooked, we can swallow eggs that hatch in our intestines into wormlike, bloodsucking parasites that burrow out through the intestinal wall, and then migrate throughout our body. Rarely, they can tunnel into the eye. And when they say tongue worm in human eye, they mean like literally swimming around inside the eyeball. And yes, they’ve got video.
