Plant-based sources of calcium are superior to animal-based sources (kale and broccoli absorbed nearly twice as well as the calcium in cow’s milk). A comparison of the bone mineral density of vegans to omnivores found that though omnivores have more than twice as much calcium intake due to dairy consumption, both had the same bone density. Though dietary intake studies show that those eating vegan tend to be deficient in calcium as well as two other nutrients, those eating conventional diets also tend to be deficient in calcium (and 6 other nutrients). Soymilk can provide the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk as long as the soymilk is shaken. There does not appear to be credence to the theory that protein intake in is bad for bones, but AGEs and coffee consumption may have adverse effects on bone health.
