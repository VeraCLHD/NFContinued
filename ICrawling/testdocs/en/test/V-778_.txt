There’s a new treatment for genital warts. It has a fancy brand name for marketing purposes, but it’s basically just green tea in ointment form. It was tried on a thousand men and women, and complete clearance of all external genital warts was obtained in more than half the patients with a 10% or 15% green tea phytonutrient ointment. Such astounding results it’s been officially incorporated into the latest STD treatment guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. I bring this up as an illustration of the potential power of plants—like the tea plant—even when just smeared on our skin! As a physician, I care less about the strains of HPV that cause warts, and more about the HPV that causes death. We know green tea consumption is associated with lower risk of certain gynecological cancers—ovarian, endothelial—but what about the HPV-related cervical, vaginal, and vulva cancers? Well, a recent in vitro study looking at two different lines of cervical cancer cells found that green tea phytonutrients appear to open cans of cancer, whoop-ass, but in terms of diet, what’s important is that the phytonutrients in green tea appear protective, not only when applied topically to cervical lesions, but orally, as well—suggesting that high consumption of green tea could either reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, or delay the progression of precancerous lesions to cervical cancer.
