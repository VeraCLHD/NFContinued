This is what it looks like. It’s grown organically. So, no heavy metals; no industrial toxins. It’s grown bloodlessly. You know, Charlie looks happier in the commercials. It’s grown sustainably, so we’re not contributing to the extinction of our ocean wildlife. It’s grown hygienically—so, you don’t have to hear me talk about the first report this year of a new fish tapeworm in North America. Those are not noodles. Food is a package deal. No, we tell the maître d’, “I’m not trying to be difficult; I do want the omega 3s. But could I at least get the tapeworms on the side?” It doesn’t work that way. Food is a package deal. As unsavory as this may be, it’s not as bad as pork tapeworms, shown here sticking out, and here, shown literally eating someone’s brain. All the benefits, none of the risks. The long-chain omega 3s, the “DHA” in golden algae, found to be 100% bioequivalent to the DHA in fish flesh. So, organic, hygienic, sustainable, bloodless, bioequivalent; it may even be cheaper too. So, we have a choice: we can get our long-chain omega 3s this way, or…this way. Yes, people who don’t eat animals have very low levels of industrial toxins in their body, but they also have very low levels of long-chain omega 3s. So, I recommend everyone take 250mg of microalgae-based DHA daily. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. Most fish-eaters aren’t getting enough DHA for optimal health, either.
