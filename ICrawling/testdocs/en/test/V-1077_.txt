Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.The NIH-AARP study also looked at diet, lifestyle, and acute myeloid leukemia. Two things seemed to do it: smoking and total meat intake—which included all beef, chicken, fish, pork, bacon, etc.Since they measured the effect of both smoking and meat intake, we have a rare opportunity to actually compare the two in terms of cancer risk. So, in terms of our risk of getting this rare—but deadly—blood cancer, this much meat—two boneless chicken breasts’ worth—may increase our leukemia risk as much smoking ten cigarettes.So, what if we don’t eat any meat? The most comprehensive study of cancer rates in vegetarians was published last year. No surprise that vegetarians had significantly less cancer than meat-eaters.
