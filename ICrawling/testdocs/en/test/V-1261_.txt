What about meat? Overall, do you think it’s harmful, harmless, or helpful? Overall—harmful, because food is a package deal. Yes, there are lots of nutrients in beef, for example. Cows are, after all, plant-eaters. But, even though they claim you can “have it your way,” you can’t go to Burger King, order a Whopper, and say, “Could I get that without cholesterol, artery-clogging saturated fat, and… hold the hormones?” Doesn’t work that way; food is a package deal. The latest study this year found that breast cancer risk goes up more than 50% for each 100 grams of meat women eat every day. That’s like one piece of chicken. A 50% increased breast cancer risk for every daily drumstick! The most authoritative report on diet and cancer in history was published in 1997; the World Cancer Research Fund’s tome, which reviewed essentially every study on diet and cancer ever published. It concluded: “Choose a diet that is predominantly plant-based, rich in a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and beans, with minimally processed starchy foods,”—meaning whole grains. So, we should be eating fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and whole grains. That’s what thousands of studies point towards for cancer prevention: a whole-foods, plant-based diet. Ten years later, they published the sequel, covering the thousands of studies published in the interim, the last decade. And they came to the same conclusion: plant-based diets are the healthiest. But they found even stronger evidence implicating obesity, alcohol, and meat as cancer-promoters—especially cured meats like bacon, hot dogs, and cold cuts.
