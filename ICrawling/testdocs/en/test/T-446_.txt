Chlorella is unicellular freshwater green algae sold as powder or compressed into tablets. It does not have the toxins that may be present in blue-green algae or spirulina supplements. Although some adverse reactions have been reported in sensitive individuals, they were not due to toxins. For the vast majority of people, chlorella can be considered helpful. Chlorella supplementation may increase immunity. For example, chlorella supplementation appeared to prevent loss in immune function in athletes in training camp who experienced intense physical activity and group living. Athletes given a daily dose of chlorella did not experience a drop in immune function as did those who did not receive it. Another study by the World Journal of Gastroenerology was done to test the efficacy of chlorella supplementation in adults with chronic hepatitis C infection. Researchers found a significant improvement in ALT, a marker of liver inflammation, which could be explained by a beneficial immunostimulatory effect of chlorella supplementation.
