Abdominal pain has several causes, including constipation, indigestion, irritable bowel sydrome and stomach ulcers. Constipation and its complications, including hiatal hernia, varicose veins, hemorrhoids and anal fissures, may be prevented and treated by consuming adequate amounts of dietary fiber. Abdominal pain from chronic indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome may be reduced with the ingestion of hot chili peppers. Gastric ulcers, another common cause of abdominal pain, may be prevented by replacing NSAID pain medications, such as ibuprofen, which increase gastric acid secretion, with fresh sweet cherries, which contain a compound that appears to decrease pain and inflammation without gastrointestinal side effects.
