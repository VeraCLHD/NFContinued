Blueberries are among the healthiest fruits. Although there are foods with more antioxidants, blueberries have a very high antioxidant value, which can help in reaching the recommended daily intake and staying out of oxidative debt. Whole fresh blueberries have a higher phytonutrient content than dried blueberries and juice. These phytonutrients have been shown to improve memory, delay cognitive aging and Alzheimerâ€™s disease and protect against age-related macular degeneration. Blueberries may lower cancer risk, notably by increasing our cancer fighting immune cells. The fructose in blueberries and other fruits is not harmful like high fructose corn syrup or table sugar. Use blueberries in this delicious antioxidant-rich breakfast smoothie.
