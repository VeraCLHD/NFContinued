Oral cancer is one of the ten most common cancers, with a death rate around 50%. Diet and lifestyle may significantly affect one’s vulnerability to oral cancer. If you manage your weight, eat more plant foods, fewer animal foods, and less alcohol—and, if you’re a breastfeeding woman, you may significantly lower your risk of oral cancer.The foods found most protective against oral cancer include raw and green/leafy vegetables, apples, tomatoes, citrus, and carrots. Oral cancer lesions appear to respond well to black raspberries and turmeric. Deep-fried foods, such as French fries, may contain acrylamide, which has been associated with oral and other cancers.
