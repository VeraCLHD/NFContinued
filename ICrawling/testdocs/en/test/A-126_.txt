 What about my favorite recipes, my favorite kitchen gadgets, my favorite meals? That’s not what the website was made for. It’s NutritionFacts, not nutrition opinions! Interviewers are always asking me “What do you eat, Dr. Greger?” and I have to say, “It doesn’t matter what I eat; all that matters is what the science shows.” OK, but how do I take all this amazing science I’ve learned and transform it into what I actually feed my family? How do I make it digestible? (Literally!) Well, I’ve just never had an outlet to share all those personal judgements before… until now.  That’s Part 2 of the book, in which I introduce my Daily Dozen checklist of all the things we should try to fit into an optimal diet. The book details both my life and my life’s work, all rolled into one. Find it in your local bookstore or online at: If you’d like to ask me a question in person, most of my December speaking events are sold out, but there is still space available in Baltimore, Tucson, and Detroit. Then I’ve already got another 60 dates confirmed for 2016.
