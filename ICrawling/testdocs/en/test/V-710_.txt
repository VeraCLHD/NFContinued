Every few years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measures the levels of chemical pollutants in the bodies of thousands of Americans from across the country. What did the latest report tell us about our toxic burden? Or, more importantly, that of pregnant women in the United States? Published last summer in the journal of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, here is the list of chemicals they measured (on the left). And, on the right is the percentage of women (both pregnant and non-pregnant) with detectable levels of these pollutants in their bodies. Look at those numbers! Most women in this country are contaminated with heavy metals, a number of toxic solvents, endocrine disrupters, fire-retardant chemicals, PCBs, and pesticides, like DDT. And, that’s just the first page. Continuing on the next page—more pesticides, plastics chemicals, industrial toxins circulating through their bloodstreams. Look at these numbers; in many cases 99% or 100% of the hundreds of women tested were found with these chemicals in their bodies—and, potentially, passing them on to the next generation. On average, pregnant women harbored about 35 different chemicals. Each of these bars represents one woman. That’s how many chemicals they found in each of their bodies. Bottom line, they “found widespread exposure to pregnant women in the United States to multiple chemical [compounds and their metabolites], including both banned and contemporary contaminants.” Americans are walking chemical cocktails. So let us explore what consequences they may have, and how to minimize our exposure to them.
