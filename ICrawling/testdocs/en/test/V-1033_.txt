Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.Last year, we learned, in a study of Buddhist nuns, that long-term vegans—vegans for up to 72 years straight—had clinically equivalent bone mineral density, despite milk-drinking women getting twice as much calcium in their daily diet.This year, there was a 200-page review published on health indicators in people eating vegetarian long-term. What about protein status? Both vegans and meat-eaters, on average, get the recommended amount of protein in their daily diets.Meat-eaters eat about 20% more protein a day, though. But do they achieve significantly higher levels of protein in their blood? Who has higher plasma protein levels? Three choices: vegans higher, meat-eaters higher, or both the same protein levels?
