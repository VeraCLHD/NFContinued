If individual plant foods reduce the risk of prostate enlargement, what about an entire diet composed of plant foods? Here’s where the Pritikin researchers step in again. Remember how they dripped the before and after blood on prostate cancer cells? Well, they did the same thing for BPH. Took a bunch of men, put them on a plant-based diet for just two weeks, and then dripped their blood on normal prostate cells in a petri dish, and saw, as with the cancer, a significant drop in growth—and so quickly, too!The flip side, of course, is yeah, it’s amazing you could see an effect after just two weeks on a healthy diet, but if they ended the study after just two weeks, how do you know the effect doesn’t just go away? Maybe your body accustoms itself to a healthy diet, and prostate cell growth rates start slowly creeping back up?Well, they looked at that! They tested blood of people that had been eating plant-based diets for up to 28 years straight, and found the same thing, both against benign prostate cell growth, and as we saw, against cancerous prostate cell growth. As long as we continue to eat healthy, growth rates go down, and they stay down.
