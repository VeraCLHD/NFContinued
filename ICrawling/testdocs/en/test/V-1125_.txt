But what if we eat our strawberries with cream? In 2007, we learned that milk blocks the absorption of the phytonutrients in chocolate. In 2008, we learned that milk totally blocks the beneficial effects of the phytonutrients in tea. Might as well just be drinking water. What if we eat dairy at the same meal with powerful antioxidant fruits and vegetables, like berries? We didn’t know, until this year. Does dairy block berry nutrition, or not? Let’s find out. Ellagic acid is considered one of the key phytonutrients in berries—which, for example, may play a role in the ability of berries to prevent age-related cognitive decline. This is how much ellagic acid is absorbed into our bloodstream when we drink blackberry juice made with water—at half an hour, one hour, two hours, three hours, and four hours after consumption. Compare that to how much we absorb when we drink the same amount of berry juice with skim milk added. Zero. Nothing. The absorption completely blocked. Fact. And similar results were found this year with blueberries, as well. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
