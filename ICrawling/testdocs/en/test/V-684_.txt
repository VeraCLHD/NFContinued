And they’re fed to farm animals by the millions of pounds a year, to promote growth and prevent disease in the stressful, overcrowded, unhygienic environments they may be confined in these days.The PR people scoffed at the Union of Concerned Scientists estimate that as much as 70% of antibiotics produced in the U.S. go to livestock. Now, the reason that it had to be estimated, of course, is that the industry refuses to release the true numbers. But, look, it was the best we had.But, it is a statistic the mythbusters claim cannot possibly be calculated, considering that antibiotic use in humans is not tracked. Turns out, as with much in meat myth-making, this simply isn’t true. That data is tracked by the FDA Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, as pointed out by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Center for a Livable Future.So, was it really 70% of antimicrobial drugs going to farm animals, like the Union of Concerned Scientists claimed? Or, was this just a myth to be crushed? And, I have to say, according to the latest available data, the meat industry is right. It’s not 70% going to farm animals—it’s closer to 80%. More than 28 million pounds a year.
