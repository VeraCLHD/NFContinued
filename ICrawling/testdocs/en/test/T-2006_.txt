A zoonotic disease is one that can be transmitted from animals to humans.  For example, pigs appear to be the reservoir of the Hepatitis E virus. Researchers have found the virus in more than 10% of pig livers being sold, suggesting that pork intake may raise Hepatitis E risk. The risk of zoonotic infection is a possible reason why poultry and other meat industry workers have a higher risk of cancer death than other worker groups. To learn more about zoonotic disease risks, see also these topics: Ciguatera, E. coli, Eggs, Epilepsy, Hand washing, MRSA, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Parasites, Rabies, and Salmonella.
