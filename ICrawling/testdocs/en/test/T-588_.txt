Diverticulosis, outpouchings of the colon, is a prevalent intestinal disease and may be caused by not eating enough fiber. These pockets can get inflamed, resulting in diverticulitis. A plant-based diet may help treat and prevent diverticulitis. Plant-based diets are often high in fiber, allowing for bigger, more easily passable bowel movements, which may lower the risk of diverticulosis among other intestinal disorders.Â  Eating nuts may be beneficial in lowering inflammation.
