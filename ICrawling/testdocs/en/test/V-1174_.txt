That’s about what an interventional study found last year: put overweight meat-eaters on essentially a vegan diet, and they start out at an average of 221 pounds, and lose about 25 pounds a year—ending up at 168 after two years, at the end of the study; an average of 53 pounds of sustained weight loss.So eating veg can counteract the forces that lead to obesity and diabetes—though only the vegans were really in the optimal range. Inclusion of even tiny amounts of meat (including fish) in the diet—less than a single serving a week, and you lose a lot of that veg protection.So, given the healthy weights of most vegans, it’s no surprise that they have just a fraction of the diabetes risk. But the researchers did find something that blew their minds. Even after controlling for weight, and exercise, and even how much TV they watched, those eating vegan still had half the diabetes risk. So at the exact same weight, the vegan diet just has something that cuts our risk in half. So even obese vegans are still protected.
