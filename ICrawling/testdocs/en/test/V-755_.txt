If our enterocyte trash recovery bins are half-filled with phytosterols, might vitamins get crowded out, too? We didn’t know, until last year. But the answer is no, even with a whopping nine-gram dose. Vitamin absorption was unaffected. Plant stanols dose-dependently decrease bad cholesterol concentrations, but not antioxidant concentrations in our blood.Now, nine grams is like ten times what we would expect from even a healthy diet. There’s a plateau effect. At that nine grams a day, you’re way out here at the end; but, as you can see, the cholesterol-lowering curve starts to flatten out at about two.So, we can pretty much maximize cholesterol-blocking at around two grams—2000 milligrams. The Standard American Diet has been measured as low as 78 milligrams a day.Here’s like a model American Heart Association diet, and this is how high folks get eating a plant-based diet—higher than any other diet pattern reported. That could get you a good five percent cholesterol reduction. But there’s definitely room to bump that up further, if necessary.Those who have improved their diet so much they’re no longer eating any cholesterol should be acing their cholesterol tests. But, in rare cases, your body might not be able to get rid of enough endogenous production. And so, doubling phytosterol intake could easily double LDL reduction down to ten percent, which could double heart disease risk reduction.In terms of whole foods sources to maximize cholesterol reduction, seeds provide the most (especially sesame), then nuts (especially pistachio), then legumes (like peanuts).
