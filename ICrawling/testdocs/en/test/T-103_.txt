Most Americans may eat more protein than their bodies need.Cancer may be associated with increased consumption of animal protein. Animal proteins putrefy when incompletely digested, increasing colonic alkalinity and producing gases associated with dramatic rises in colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. The cancer link may be attributed to animal protein’s stimulation of IGF-1. If the proteins are cooked at high temperatures (frying, broiling), potent carcinogens such as PhIP and other heterocyclic amines can be created. Leucine in protein stimulates TOR (Target of Rapamycin), which can accelerate aging and promote colon and breast cancer.Kidney problems and diabetes may also be related to animal protein. Animal protein can impair kidney function and contribute to kidney stones. Animal protein may also exacerbate the insulin spike of carbohydrate ingestion and contribute to diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness. Adenovirus which can come from eating chicken, is strongly linked to childhood obesity with later diabetic consequences.Animal protein has been linked to other negative health effects, including acne, female infertility, infant sleep apnea, autism, crib death, and premature puberty.A plant-based diet can supply adequate amounts of protein. Plant sources of protein may be preferable to animal-based, as their proteins contain more potassium and fewer sulfur-containing amino acids, such as leucine and methionine. In fact, an excess of vegetable protein is heart-protective.  Plant-based “chicken” has protein and iron equal to regular chicken, as well as providing fiber missing from animal products.
