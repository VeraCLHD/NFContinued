What about rose hips for osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that’s very frustrating to treat—and worse to have, no doubt. It can be painful and debilitating. Rose hips have long been considered the traditional herbal remedy. Rose hips are the fruits of the rose bush. Good, bad, or useless? Good; resulting in a significant reduction in pain. And it may help with rheumatoid arthritis, too. What if you don’t have any rose bushes, though? You can get them dried, in bulk, at your local natural foods store, and just eat them straight. For arthritis sufferers, I’d recommend asking your doctor about starting on a dose of ten rose hip berries a day.
