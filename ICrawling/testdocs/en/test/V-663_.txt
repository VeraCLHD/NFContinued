But, this was based on placental tissue samples.Let’s stack mushrooms up against the real thing. Human breast cancer cells in a petri dish. If you do nothing, they just keep growing and proliferating at the same rate. But, if you add the raw material the cancer cells use to make their own estrogen, they take full advantage, and grow like crazy, ten times as fast. But then, as you add more and more white mushroom extract to shut off estrogen manufacturing, you can get cancer growth almost back to baseline.So, the last study proved mushrooms could inhibit that enzyme, and even figured out which mushroom worked the best. Here, they went a step further to see it in action, in actual breast cancer cells.Now that we know it may work, what’s the required dose? I mean, how many mushrooms do you have to eat? Maybe it’s some, you know, ridiculous amount? Based on these studies, the consumption of just five mushrooms a day may be sufficient to suppress breast tumor growth.
