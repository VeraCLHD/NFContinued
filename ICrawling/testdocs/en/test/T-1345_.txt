The health benefits that are believed to be associated with Omega-3 fatty acid intake include: decreased inflammation, help for arthritis, and reduced symptoms of depression. Omega-3 may even boost health and intelligence of unborn babies, though the mercury in fish significantly decreases IQ. While often a recommended source of omega-3, fish and fish-oil supplements may not be harmless due to the presence of dioxins, PCBs, mercury, and other industrial pollutants. These pollutants in fish may increase our risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiac death. Other animal products such as chicken are no longer a bountiful source of omega-3 due to genetic manipulation. Omega-3 enriched eggs can be a source, but eggs contain cholesterol and arachidonic acid. Two plant-based sources sources of omega-3 are flax seeds and algae-based DHA supplements, which are bioequivalent to fish oil but do not have the harmful industrial toxins.
