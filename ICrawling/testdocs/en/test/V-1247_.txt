This year’s recipe came out of my need to find some way to incorporate cloves and cinnamon into my family's diet. One can of pumpkin, about 10 ounces of silken tofu, one to two dozen pitted dates, depending how sweet your sweet tooth is. Then, you add in as much powdered cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg as you can stand. Blend it all together in a food processor, pour it in a whole wheat pie crust, bake at 350º for a half hour or so, and you have healthy pumpkin pie—it’s just fruit, vegetables, tofu, and, gram-for-gram, the most powerful antioxidant foods in the world. The more pie you eat, the healthier you are.
