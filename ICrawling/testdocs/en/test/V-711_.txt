Well, duh; it’s probably because they just felt so much better. But, researchers decided to put it to the test.Millions of Americans suffer from depression each year; a disabling disease that can even end up fatal—due to suicide.Enter saffron. A double blind, randomized trial: saffron versus Prozac.
