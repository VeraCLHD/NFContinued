As we age, our immune system starts to decline. That’s why when you hear infectious disease advisories, they often list those at greatest risk include infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly—because the elderly are, to some extent, immunocompromised.Recently, researchers in Belfast reported an investigation into the “possibility that inadequate diet may be a contributing factor” to immunological aging. Both immunity and fruit and vegetable intake can be low in the elderly, so they wondered if there might be a connection.So, they rounded up 83 volunteers between 65 and 95 years of age, and randomized them into the control group, following their pitiful two or fewer servings of fruits and vegetables a day diet, versus the experimental group that were told to consume at least five. They did this for a month, before they were due for their pneumonia vaccine. The experimental group didn’t quite hit five daily servings, but at least they did better than the control group.Here’s what happened when they were given pneumovax. Here’s the immune response in the control group. They were injected with pneumonia bacteria vaccine. Their immune systems should have gone crazy making antibodies to fight off the perceived invader, and they tried their best. But this is the group that was on almost five servings of fruits and veggies every day for the prior four weeks.Influenza and pneumonia constitute the seventh leading cause of death for our elderly. It’s never too late to start eating healthier.
