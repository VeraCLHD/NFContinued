Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.“The effects of a commercially available botanical supplement on strength, body composition, power output, and hormonal profiles in resistance-trained males.” Something “had a significant impact on both upper- and lower-body strength and body composition in comparison to placebo in a double blind controlled trial. These changes were obtained with no clinical side effects.” Allowed these men to leg press an extra hundred pounds, compared to placebo. And, the magical substance was fenugreek, “a naturally occurring edible spice” that appears to double “as an anticancer agent.” Here’s prostate cancer cells in a petri dish; here’s prostate cancer with a little fenugreek. Here’s another type of cancer, before and after. What about normal prostate cells, though? Before fenugreek, and after. That’s what we like to see.­­ “In summary, fenugreek seeds [may] possess potent anti-cancer properties.”
