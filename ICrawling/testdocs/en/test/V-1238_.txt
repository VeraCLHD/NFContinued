If you are more of a water person, which is healthier—bottled or tap? In terms of both chemical and microbiological purity? It depends where you live, but for most Americans, which is better—bottled or tap? And the answer is tap, based primarily on bacterial contamination recently found in several brands of bottled water.The only population that should consider really sticking to bottled or filtered water is pregnant women, during the summer, in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Maryland, where the chlorination spike may be a little too high for comfort.
