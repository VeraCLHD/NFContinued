Breast cancer has been the traditional target of these cooked meat carcinogens, but now, there’s also prostate, stomach, colon, and kidney cancer concerns, as well. We also knew these cooked muscle chemicals are neurotoxic, and so, last year, researchers looked into meat consumption and “essential tremor"—which is one of the most common neurological conditions in the world. These tremors can start as early as our 40s, and it usually starts in the hands, but can spread to the rest of the body, and become quite debilitating. And we never knew what caused it. But now, at least for men, we seem to have a lead. Men eating the most meat in this study had more than 20 times the odds of having this tremor. Just to illustrate how dramatic a 20-fold increase is, the odds of a pack-a-day smoker getting lung cancer after 20 years is only 13 times that of nonsmokers. So for meat and tremor, it comes out to be 6% increased risk for every 10 grams of meat consumed daily. That’s like one strip of bacon. That means if we eat the equivalent of a chicken breast a day, we may double our risk of developing a tremor for the rest of our lives.
