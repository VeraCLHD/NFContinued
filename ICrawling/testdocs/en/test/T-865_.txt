Green tea is one of the healthiest beverages we can drink, with antibacterial, antitoxin, antiviral, antifungal, anti-cancer (including breast), UV protectants, and reduced all-cause mortality benefits (although hibiscus tea may actually have more antioxidants). Green tea may also reduce nausea, pain, and stress, boost our resting metabolism, and help prevent nitrate to nitrite conversion. Tea may even positively affect our mind and inhibit the production of TOR. Gargling tea may help prevent the common cold. Drinking coffee is also health-promoting, though green tea is better. But adding cowâ€™s milk or soy milk to tea may compromise some of the beneficial effects. About 10 cups of tea a day is probably the safe upper limit. Drinking too much tea may increase risk of fluorosis in children. Matcha tea (powdered green tea leaves) is likely the healthiest form, but if brewing instead, cold steeping may actually be best.
