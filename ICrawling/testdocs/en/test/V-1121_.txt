What’s the latest on eggs? Well, the fallout from the Harvard Physicians' study continues—which, as I covered last year, showed that eating just a single egg a day, or more, significantly shortens one's lifespan.“More egg on [the medical profession’s] face?", this editorial read in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. "Better [egg on our face] than having it go down [our] gullet."Dr. David Spence is Director of the Stroke Prevention & Atherosclerosis Research Center in Ontario—one of the world’s leading stroke experts. He ruffled a few feathers this year when he said that based on the latest research, you can eat all the eggs you want—if you’re dying from a terminal illness. Then, it doesn’t matter. Now the egg industry’s nutritionist disagreed—to which Dr. Spence replied, “Who would you want to believe—the dietician who works for the Egg Farmers of Canada or a doctor who has spent 30 years trying to prevent strokes? I don’t have any interest in this at all, but they certainly do. They are selling eggs; I am selling stroke prevention.”Since the Harvard Physicians' Study results were published, egg consumption has also been linked to heart failure, along with dairy, as well as diabetes in both men and women. A single egg a day, or more. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring watch the above video.
