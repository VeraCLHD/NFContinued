The standard American diet—that is, the typical diet of the majority of Americans—is high in meat, dairy, fat, sugar as well as refined, processed, and junk foods. The shift in Western diets to include more animal sourced foods and more sugar and corn syrup happened especially quickly after World War II.The standard American diet includes low intake of fruit and vegetables. A 2010 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control showed that overall, only one state improved on vegetable and fruit consumption compared to such consumption ten years earlier. A study showing compliance with 2005 U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines showed only ¼ of Americans ate at least one fruit serving a day, while only about 1 in 10 ate the recommended minimum amount for vegetables. The average amount of kale each American eats per week is about half a teaspoon.

Even after years of eating the standard American diet, it’s possible to reduce chronic disease risk by eating healthier. Research studies have found potential links between the standard American diet and risks of the following diseases and conditions:
