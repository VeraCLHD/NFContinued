A non-profit research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C., the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) promotes bringing nutrition into medical education and practice, conducting clinical research on healthful diets, educating the public on how diet can impact their health, and advocating for alternatives to animal research. PCRM was established in 1985 by Dr. Neal Barnard. Examples of the work done by PCRM include poster-style infographics such as “The Five Worst Contaminants in Chicken Products” (feces, toxic chemicals, superbugs, carcinogens, and cholesterol). They also conduct real-world research, such as the first-ever workplace intervention study, which took place at Geico corporate headquarters. Significant health benefits came as a result of educating employees about plant-based diets and offering some healthier options in the cafeteria. PCRM also ran a campaign called “Meat is the new tobacco.” Dr. Barnard’s editorials and PCRM’s other related materials tried to get across the argument that moving to a plant-based diet can now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking.
