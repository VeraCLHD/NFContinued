Kiwifruit have had more research done on them than most produce because the market is cornered by a few producers who stand to benefit even though it’s an “unbranded” product. Though most have been funded by the International Kiwifruit Organization and Zepri, the largest marketer of kiwis in the world, kiwifruit may improve cholesterol levels, suppress platelet activation without affecting clotting, improve bowel functions in those suffering irritable bowel syndrome, increase DNA repair enzymes, and if eaten an hour before bed, may also improve sleep quality and duration for those suffering from insomnia.
