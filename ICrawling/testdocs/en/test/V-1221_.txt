Which is worse: sugar or corn syrup? Three choices: the sugar, the corn syrup, or, they’re both just as bad? Around and around it goes; where it stops, maybe some of you knew. Equally bad.Now that was kind of a trick question. Regular, baking corn syrup is pure glucose; zero fructose. There’s no corn syrup in soft drinks, either. It’s all high-fructose corn syrup. Now, some of you may have heard the rumor that high-fructose corn syrup may contain mercury.Let’s assume, for the purposes of this question, that there’s no mercury: pure sugar, versus pure high-fructose corn syrup. Is the sugar worse? Is the high-fructose corn syrup worse? Or, are they still both equally bad?And the winning loser is—both of them. Table sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose, and high-fructose corn syrup is about 45%/55%. It doesn’t matter; it’s all just sugar. The Corn Refiners Association launched a $25 million PR campaign last year, boasting that high-fructose corn syrup is as good for you as sugar. True, but again, how much is that really saying?
