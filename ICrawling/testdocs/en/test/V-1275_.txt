Okay, so the bronze goes to hormonal genital meat malformation. The silver goes to a study on IQ and vegetarianism. First, let me share a little background. We've known for nearly 30 years that vegetarian children test smarter than omnivorous kids. First shown in a 1980 study by Tufts University, the IQ of vegetarian children was found to be about 16 points above average. And their "mental age" was a year ahead of the rest of their classmates. Of all the veg kids, the vegan kids appeared the smartest. The pediatricians and psychologists knew the veg kids were bright, but the researchers noted that they were puzzled that they were so much superior. Which came first, though? The chicken or the egg? Well, for the vegan kids, neither, perhaps. But were they smart because they were vegetarians, and therefore getting all that good nutrition—or did they become vegetarian because they were so smart? Well, the mystery has finally been solved—I guess. Those fantastic Brits followed 8,000 kids for 30 years. Measured their IQ at age 10, then came back 20 years later and asked which of them had become vegetarian during that time. Their findings? Higher scores for IQ in childhood are associated with an increased likelihood of being a vegetarian as an adult. Smart people evidently eat vegetarian. They even quote Benjamin Franklin saying vegetarian diets result in "greater clearness of head and quicker comprehension."
