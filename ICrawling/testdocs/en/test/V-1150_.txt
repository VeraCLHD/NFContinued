In a study of the links between fish consumption and infertility, levels of mercury were measured in vegans, for the first time ever. They took hair samples from fish-eaters and vegans, and this is what they found: ten times more mercury contamination in the bodies of those who eat fish. In fact, if you take meat-eaters and put them on a vegetarian diet, within just three months, the level of mercury in their bodies drops significantly—as well as other toxic heavy metal levels, such as cadmium and lead. The one graph going up is magnesium; that’s a good thing, actually. Whereas the more fish meals we eat per month, the higher our mercury levels climb. Just one or more fish meals a week, and one in four women exceed the EPA mercury safety limits. What’s the big deal about mercury? Hundreds of thousands of American babies poisoned by their mothers’ fish consumption every single year. So much mercury coming from their mothers—measured straight from the umbilical cord blood—that they’re born with brain damage. The resulting loss of intelligence that will plague these kids for the rest of their lives—because their moms ate fish—is estimated to cost our nation billions of dollars in lost productivity. We’d be billions of dollars more productive, had these hundreds of thousands of kids been born smarter, if their moms had been smarter, and not ate fish during pregnancy. Of course, you can’t blame the mothers if they simply didn’t know how much they were damaging the brains of their children with every bite.
