So ideally, every day: greens, beans, berries, tea, and nuts. Don't nuts make you fat, though? No! Here's the latest study. Two handfuls of nuts added to their daily diet, and no weight gain. Every single one of the 20 studies on nuts and weight gain: 20 out of 20 say the same thing; no weight gain. We're not sure if they boost our metabolism or heck, violate the second law of thermodynamics. Regardless, nuts will not make us fat. That's what the science shows.Though meat, eggs, and dairy might. The biggest study on vegans in human history found that not only are vegans leaner than everyone else—leaner than vegetarians, who are leaner than omnivores—but vegans get less of that age-related weight gain. We don't know exactly why, but it may partly be due to the soy. Compared to milk protein, the protein in soy prevents the increase in abdominal fat observed with the milk protein casein.  Feed people dairy protein, and you can see their tummy fat increases 20 to 40 square centimeters. Whereas the same diet—the exact same diet, same calories, same everything, except soy protein instead of milk protein—and abdominal fat shrinks 10 to 15 square centimeters.There's lots of buzz about the new over-the-counter fat-blocking diet drug, alli®. It has some side effects, of course. Side effects with names like anal leakage. This is the drug company's website promoting the drug, and they're so concerned about the resulting uncontrollable diarrhea that they advise, "It's probably a smart idea to wear dark pants, and to bring a change of clothes with you to work." They are forced to advertise the fact that their drug may cause you to crap your pants at work! So I guess you can choose a good diet, or a good diaper!
