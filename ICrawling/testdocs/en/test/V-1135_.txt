What about gluten—the protein in wheat, which is used to make a number of mock meats, like seitan? You may or may not have noticed a bunch of labels recently touting gluten-free foods and diets. Gluten: harmful, harmless, or good for you? For literally more than 99% of people, gluten/seitan/wheat protein is good for you. Excellent source of high quality protein; the very staff of life. But, only for 99.3% of people. One in every 133rd American has celiac disease—whether they know it or not. And for those people, gluten consumption can cause a range of symptoms, including chronic diarrhea, bloating, weight loss, and fatigue—all of which disappear when they’re placed on a gluten-free diet. For the other 132 out of 133 people, though, gluten is fine. If you do have any of those symptoms, though, you should get tested for the disease. It’s a simple blood test; the standard intestinal biopsy may not be necessary. And in fact, since testing is getting so simple, there’s consideration of just screening all kids for it, to pick up those rare celiac cases—since if you do have it, but don’t know it, you may live a significantly shorter lifespan. So, get tested if you’re concerned.
