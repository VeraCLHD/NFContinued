Anyway, DDT was banned in 1972, and replaced by the insecticide dieldrin, subsequently found to be so toxic it was outlawed in 1974. But it’s still around, and appears to be why every single prospective study on dairy consumption and Parkinson’s disease shows more milk means more Parkinson’s. “Though dieldrin has been banned, humans continue to be exposed to the pesticide through contaminated dairy products and meats due to the persistent accumulation of the pesticide in the environment.”What else can these persistent pollutants do? Just from the research published over the last year: linked to endometriosis, fibrosis, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease mortality, and even gum disease.When pregnant women eat lots of animal products, because of these pollutants in animal fats, they risk having babies with smaller brains, lower intelligence, poorer attention span, other cognitive impairments, and more pediatric respiratory infections. The more of the DDT metabolite DDE women are exposed to, the fatter their daughters may become when they grow up. “Prenatal exposure…may contribute to the obesity epidemic in women.”Toxic waste exposure in the diet may even result in fewer men in the world. Pregnant women exposed to the most PCBs were 33% less likely to have a boy, and we’re not sure if that’s because the PCBs damage male sperm or male embryos. But if having a baby girl is more important than your health, bulking up on PCBs may do it for you, and fish and other aquatic animals provide about three-quarters of human PCB dietary exposure. And the same with dioxins. Fish are the main culprit. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
