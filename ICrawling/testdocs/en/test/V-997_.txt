In this study of Boston vegans, concerns were raised about their iodine status, but one vegan’s iodine level was so high, they were excluded from the study. How is that possible? They were consuming kelp. As I’ve written in my iodine recommendations for a decade now, unless your neighborhood nuclear plant just melted down, no kelp—it just has too much iodine.

But if you just read kombu on a label, would you think anything of it? Well, we should. There was a worldwide recall, complete with headlines like: “Café raid seizes banned soy milk.” A black market trade was operating in the banned soy milk, even though they faced half million dollar fines.
