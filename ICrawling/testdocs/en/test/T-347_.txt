Calcium is more readily absorbable from greens such as kale and broccoli than milk. Getting your calcium from plants also means that getting fiber, antioxidants, and folate as well, whereas dairy calcium comes with saturated fat, hormones, and cholesterol. Calcium supplements are not recommended as they might increase your risk of other conditions like glaucoma. Soluble oxalates can bind to calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate, which can lead to kidney stones in susceptible individuals, which is why some people may want to limit their intake of turmeric. Despite prior beliefs that high protein intake is associated with increased calcium excretion through urine, this calcium loss predominantly does not appear to come from the skeleton. Omnivores, raw food enthusiasts, and vegans alike were all found to be eating calcium deficient diets. Long-time vegans appear to have the same bone mineral density as omnivores of a similar height, weight, and activity level, despite the fact that they may only consume about half the amount of calcium as their dairy-eating counterparts.  High consumption of phytates and fiber appears to enhance bone-mineral density.  Moreover, fortified soymilk is absorbed just as well as cow’s milk by osteopenic post-menopausal women (although you must shake the soy milk carton to distribute the calcium).
