Next up, lamb chops. The prevalence of the parasite Toxoplasma “in lambs destined for human consumption in the USA.” USDA researchers obtained the hearts of 383 lambs on the day of killing. So for those of you who think the USDA doesn’t have a heart? Wrong—they’ve got 383!What do you think they found? Greater than 50% infested? Or less than 50%?The good news is, it was less than half—only about 1 in 6 U.S. lambs are actively infected. The bad news is that 10% of Americans are currently infected with this brain parasite. That means, odds are, we all know people who have a battle going on inside their skulls, between their immune system and these Toxoplasma brain parasites—which have been linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson’s. But most people’s immune systems are able to keep them at bay.Should our immune system start to seriously slip, though, they can infect our eyeballs. Here’s a closeup of the back of someone’s infected eye. This is what it looks like in the brain of an adult. And this is what these parasites can do to the brains of our children.No one, but particularly not pregnant women, should eat undercooked meat.
