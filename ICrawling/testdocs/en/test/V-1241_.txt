Now, this study didn't include soybeans, but there was a study this year that answered the question, which is healthier, tofu or edamame—the soybean itself. What do you think? Tofu? Edamame? It is indeed the edamame. But, what about tempeh versus edamame? Who votes tempeh? Edamame? Tempeh is actually healthier. Tempeh, like edamame, is a whole soy food—you can see the little individual beans in there; but the fermentation process adds extra nutrition. It's more antimutagenic than unfermented beans.
