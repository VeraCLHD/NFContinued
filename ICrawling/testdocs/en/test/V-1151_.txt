Until the 20th century, the average age of puberty for girls was 16 or 17 years old. Now, we’re seeing significant numbers of girls starting to grow breasts before they’re 8. The change has been so dramatic that the medical profession has had to keep changing its standards for what’s currently pathological. The question is why. Is it just fiction that the increase in meat consumption has something to do with it? It appears to be fact. Based on Harvard data, “Girls who consumed more…animal protein and less vegetable protein” started their periods earlier. And it may not just be the hormone content in milk, meat, and eggs. A study of Korean children found that seafood and processed meat seemed to be the main culprits, and they think it may be the endocrine-disrupting industrial chemicals that build up in the meat—fish in particular—like the dioxins and PCBs, which may be what’s doing it.
