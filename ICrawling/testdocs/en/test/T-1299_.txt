Neurotoxins are substances that deleterious to nerve tissue. Neurotoxins in meat and fish may be contributing to brain damage (including memory loss and dementia) as well as muscle tremors, and the effects of consuming contaminated fish may last for decades.  Neurotoxins found in chicken may be linked to hand tremors, the most common movement disorder. The neurotoxin, BMAA, found in seafood may be linked to ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease).
