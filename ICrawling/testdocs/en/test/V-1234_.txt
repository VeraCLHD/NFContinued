Other studies just out show the same phenomenon. Roasted almonds healthier than raw. The cholesterol-lowering effect of all sorts of good veggies improved by cooking. This new study found that long-term raw foodists had low levels of the phytonutrient lycopene, compared to the general population. Lycopene is the wonderful cancer-fighting red pigment in tomatoes. Well, cooked tomatoes provide four times more lycopene than raw tomatoes.And cancer prevention is just the beginning. Tomato juice can lower our bad cholesterol 13%. Can successfully treat seasonal allergies, and may even help treat asthma. Treating asthma with tomato sauce. But when we eat tomatoes raw, we’re losing 75% down the drain.Raw foods are not necessarily healthier. My recommendation is to prepare vegetables in whichever way will get you to eat the most of them.
