Fish and other seafood intake may introduce hormones and other pollutants that interfere with male fertility by lowering sperm count and sperm quality, even if the exposure occurs in infancy. Hormones in meat, especially chicken, may be associated with ovulatory infertility in women; consumption during pregnancy may alter testicular development of a male fetus and produce behavioral disorders. Hormones in cow’s milk may be the reason that women on a conventional diet have five times the rate of twin births than vegan women. Soy hormones do not decrease sperm count and, in fact, vegetable protein increases fertility. But non-GMO soy is commonly contaminated with Monsanto’s Roundup which may disrupt embryonic development of rat testicles.
