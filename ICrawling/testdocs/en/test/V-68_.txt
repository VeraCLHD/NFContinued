Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.Bob and Sally are confused. They want to eat healthy, but there’s so much confusing information out there.Which diet is really the best one? Yes, there’s calcium in cheese, protein in pork, and iron in beef. But, what about all the baggage that comes along with these nutrients—the dose of dairy hormones, the lard, the saturated fat?As much as Burger King proclaims you can “Have It Your Way,” you can’t go up to the counter and ask for a burger, hold the saturated fat and cholesterol. Food is a package deal. Dairy is the #1 source of calcium in the United States—but it’s also the #1 source of saturated fat.But what kind of baggage do you get along with the calcium in dark green leafy vegetables? Fiber, folate, iron, antioxidants—some of the very nutrients lacking in milk.Plant foods average 64 times more antioxidants than animal foods. By getting most of your nutrition from whole plant foods, you get more of a bonus, instead of baggage.When the National Pork Board promotes ham as an “excellent source of protein,” I can’t help but think of the famous quote from a McDonald’s senior vice president for marketing who, under oath in a court of law, described Coca-Cola as nutritious because it is “providing water.”
