Cervical cancer can be life-threatening.  Potentially due to exposure to certain zoonotic (animal-to-human) viruses, some groups such as poultry slaughterhouse and processing plant workers and butchers’ wives may have higher cervical cancer risk.  To help prevent cervical cancer, research suggests higher vegetable intake. Some foods that may have a beneficial effect on cervical cancer prevention and treatment include: turmeric application for early stage cancer; phytate intake from beans, grains, nuts and seeds, green tea, broccoli, broccoli sprouts, amla, raspberries, strawberries, and chamomile tea.
