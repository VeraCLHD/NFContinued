Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. A review of all the best studies ever done on potassium intake, and its relationship to two of our top killers—stroke and heart disease—was recently published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. A 1,600 milligram per day higher potassium intake was associated with a 21% lower risk of stroke. That still wouldn’t get the average American up even to the minimum adequate intake, but may still might be able to wipe out a fifth of their stroke risk. “These results support recommendations for higher consumption of potassium-rich foods to prevent vascular diseases.”What does that mean, potassium-rich foods? “Potassium is particularly abundant in fruits and vegetables. A greater fruit and vegetable consumption has already been shown to protect against the occurrence of stroke.” According to another meta-analysis, “5 or more servings of fruit and vegetables per day are associated with [a quarter] lower rate of stroke compared with 3 or fewer servings.”And, it’s not just bananas. Chiquita must have had some great PR firm or something. I don’t know why that’s like one of the only things people know about nutrition. In reality, bananas don’t even make the top 50 sources, coming in at #86—right behind fast-food vanilla milk shakes. And, only then, bananas.
