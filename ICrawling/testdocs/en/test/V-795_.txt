But, fewer than half, 45%, believed it’s legal for grocery stores to sell meat with food-poisoning bacteria on it. It must be illegal, right? You can’t sell unsafe cars; you can’t sell unsafe toys. How could they possibly sell unsafe meat?Yet it’s totally legal for most food-poisoning bugs. They do it by blaming the consumer. As USDA poultry microbiologist Nelson Cox said, “Raw meats are not idiot-proof. They can be mishandled and when they are, it’s like handling a hand grenade. If you pull the pin, somebody’s going to get hurt.” See, if we get sick, it’s our fault—not the meat industry, for selling meat contaminated with crap.While some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in the supermarket, the USDA poultry expert disagrees: “I think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it.” That’s like a car company saying, “Yeah, we installed faulty brakes, but it’s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt.”Patricia Griffin, director of Epidemiological Research at the Centers for Disease Control, responded famously to this kind of blame-the-victim attitude. “Is it reasonable,” she asked of the meat industry, ‘“that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger…their three-year-old dies?”
