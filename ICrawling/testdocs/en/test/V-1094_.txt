Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. It’s not what you eat, though, but what you absorb. Check out this study on long-term raw foodists. This study was done in Europe, so the “average Western diet” here wasn’t terrible. Four servings of fruits and vegetables a day, versus a better diet—seven servings a day of fruits and veggies, both raw and cooked; versus a raw food diet, in which they ate, on average, a whopping 17 servings of fruits and veggies a day; leading them to have about three times the beta-carotene intake. But that’s intake. How much of it actually got into their bloodstream? Blood beta-carotene is considered a good surrogate marker for a healthy diet. “Tell me what your blood beta-carotene level is, I will tell you what your health risk is!” So who had the most beta-carotene in their bodies? Those eating 4 servings-a-day; 7; or 14? It was the middle group; the 7 servings-a-day group, because cooking can boost the absorption of phytonutrients like beta-carotene—like the cooked carrots having more antioxidants than raw.
