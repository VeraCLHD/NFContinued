Admittedly, this ranking of foods simply by antioxidant level is an oversimplification. As reviewed recently in the Annals of the NY Academy of Sciences: “From Beans to Berries and Beyond: Teamwork between Plant Chemicals for Protection of Optimal Health.” Not only may phytonutrients work together; many have healthful properties beyond just their antioxidant power. For example, berries have antiproliferative effects on cancer cells—they can slow down cancer growth. These are the cervical cancer cells that killed this woman, Henrietta Lacks, 58 years ago, and they’re still growing, still multiplying, nearly six decades later. And adding an extract of blueberries to her cancer cells doesn’t seem to matter much. The cancer cells are still steaming away at about 100% growth.But look what these other fruits can do. Raspberries cut the growth in half, and strawberries blocked cancer growth by almost 75%. And the higher the strawberry dose, the more the cancer is inhibited. But which works better, conventional strawberries or organic strawberries? At every single concentration, and in every single variety, organic beat out conventional. Remember, lower growth is better. And this was for both human colon cancer cells, and human breast cancer cells.We don’t have to necessarily eat the berries themselves for their benefits; we can eat the liver, eyes, or brains of berry-fed pigs. But, I’d stick with the berries.
