“…Vegan couple whose baby died of vitamin deficiency after being fed solely on breast milk…” Uh, isn’t that what you’re supposed to feed babies? Yes, but if you’re not getting enough vitamin B12, then your baby’s not getting enough B12.“Parents adopted lifestyle after watching TV programme about butchered cows,” and ended up generating headlines like this: “Vegans charged in death…over death…after death…neglect…neglect and death…and baby killing.” “Poll: did a vegan diet kill the baby?”Why, yes it did. A non-B12-fortified vegan diet killed that little girl, and she’s not the first. And if vegans don’t get their act together and get their B12, she will not be the last.
