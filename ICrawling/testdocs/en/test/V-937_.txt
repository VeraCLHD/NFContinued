You’ve heard me say over and over again that berries are the best fruit. So, why didn’t cranberries do better than these others? Because it’s not cranberry juice; it’s cranberry cocktail—only 25% juice. So, it should rightly be way up here, and take the gold.How do you do it without the corn syrup, though? You make your own: 2 cups of water, a handful of frozen cranberries, 8 teaspoons of erythritol, and a hardcore blender. When you do that, you don’t end up with 100% juice; you end up with 200% juice.Let me explain. Here’s the amount of six amazing phytonutrients in frozen cranberries. But then, you blanch them, throw away all the wonderful solids, clarify it, pasteurize it, and you’re left with less than half of the phytonutrients that you started with. So, even if you found 100% cranberry juice, it would really be only 50% of the whole berry’s phytonutrient power.That’s why it’s better to blend the whole thing up. I call it my pink juice, but it’s not really juice at all; it’s whole fruit. Nothing taken away or filtered out. Comes out to be about 12 calories—25 times fewer calories, with at least 8 times more phytonutrient nutrition.When I make it with dark red frozen cherries with the juice of a whole lemon thrown in, I call it my red juice.The only thing healthier than berries? Dark green leafies. So for extra credit add some fresh mint leaves. Gives it this weird-looking green foam on top, but then you’re chugging down greens and berries—the two healthiest things on the planet.
