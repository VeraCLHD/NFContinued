Indian gooseberries can block cancer cell growth, but tumor growth is just half the picture. You could have a tumor the size of a watermelon, as long as it doesn’t spread. So these researchers took human breast cancer cells, and basically put them on a block of Jell-O, to see if the Indian gooseberries—amla—could prevent the invasion of the cancer into the Jell-O.So here’s the control. 100% invasion; the breast cancer cells just burrow right in and effectively metastasize. Here’s if you infuse the Jell-O with the standard chemotherapy drug Taxol, which we talked about before; cuts invasion in half. Then they used tiny doses of amla, down in this range here, where it’s not even really affecting the growth much. And, as you can see, the anti-invasive effect of the Indian gooseberries was almost as good as the chemo.
