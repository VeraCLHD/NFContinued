Plant-based diets may help prevent each of the four common causes of vision loss – namely cataracts, glaucoma (see also here and here), age-related macular degeneration (see also here) and diabetes (see also here, here, and here). Plant-based diets may even reverse diabetic retinopathy and diabetes related eye damage. Greens and berries are the stars in this arena – and can even help relieve visual fatigue associated with staring at a computer screen all day. Drinking water may help treat dry eye disease. Organ meat and sushi consumption may put one at risk for unusual parasites, as in the case of the tongue worm and the skin worms found inside the human eye.
