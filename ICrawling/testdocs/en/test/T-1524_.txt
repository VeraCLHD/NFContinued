Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts, and may be beneficial to our health, especially our gastrointestinal tracts. Probiotics may reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and help boost the immune system. They may also help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and speed recovery from acute gastroenteritis. One study found that a month of probiotics can significantly decrease anxiety, depression, anger and hostility symptoms. Lactobacillus probiotics may help with childhood asthma. Probiotic bacterial survival is likely best when provided within 30 minutes before or simultaneously with a meal or beverage that has some fat.Â  While taking probiotic supplements may boost beneficial bacteria, eating a plant-based diet will do so as well.
