Chamomile is one of the oldest widely used medicinal plants in the world. A recent review suggests there is scientific evidence supporting its use against inflammation, cancer, the common cold, heart disease, diarrhea, eczema, ulcers, hemorrhoids, mouth ulcers, osteoporosis, insomnia, anxiety, diabetes, sore throat, vaginitis, wounds, and the kitchen sink. “Safety in young children, pregnant or nursing women, or those with liver or kidney disease has not been established, although there have not been any credible reports of toxicity caused by this common tea beverage.” Well, now there is. See, chamomile is a powerful anti-inflamamtory agent, and that’s the problem. There’s a reason pregnant women are not supposed to take anti-inflammatory drugs, like aspirin. “Premature constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus following the maternal consumption of camomile herbal tea.”The researchers observed two cases of premature ductal closure associated with maternal consumption of chamomile tea, which can be associated with serious fetal complications. The good news; if it’s caught early, and the herbal tea is stopped, the condition can be reversed. In the second case, though, they had to do an emergency Caesarean.“We would advocate caution,” the researchers conclude, “in regular consumption of camomile tea during pregnancy.”
