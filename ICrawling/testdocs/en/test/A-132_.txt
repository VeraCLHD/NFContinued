 Then what I’ll do is send you bookplates to the address you specify on the form. Bookplates are decorative labels pasted inside the front covers of books. I’m having special stickers made up that I will sign, personalize, and send to you to stick inside your books when they arrive.  Want me to wish someone a happy holiday or gently remind them to cut down on soda or eat their greens? Just tell me if there’s anything in particular you’d like me to say for each of the books. Be sure to fill out the form before midnight December 7, 2015, since after that, pre-orders turn into actual orders–I can’t wait! Book Tour After the December 8th deadline, the only way to get your book signed would be in person. Currently I’m confirmed in about 50 cities in 5 countries and hope to add dozens more dates. If you’d like me to come to speak in your community, hospital, school, or workplace please fill out a Speaking Request. It’s amazing I can affect so many millions of lives online, at home in my jammies, but it’s just not the same. I love traveling around and meeting everyone–I hope to see you soon! Audiobook Update After about 40 hours of recording in the studio, the audiobook is done! In fact, they even gave me an audio clip to share. Go to https://soundcloud.com/macaudio-2/how-not-to-die-by-michael-greger-md-preface and you can hear me read the very first paragraphs of the book. I’m so glad I ended up doing it!
