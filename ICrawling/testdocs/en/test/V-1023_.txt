What about licorice? The kind that’s made out of actual licorice root—not the artificially-flavored corn syrup stuff. So, like, health food store licorice. Harmful, harmless, or helpful?Licorice can be quite harmful. The natural compound that makes licorice so sweet can affect kidney function. Just four candy cigars for two weeks landed this woman in the hospital—a physician no less. She recovered completely, but others have not been so lucky.Now, there is some evidence that the same compound may be effective at killing human prostate cancer cells in a Petri dish, so one could argue that these people were just eating too much of a good thing. But the safety window is so narrow. The safe upper limit of black licorice intake is six grams; so that’s like only six inches of licorice.And it may be especially detrimental for pregnant women. Kids born to moms who ate a lot of licorice when pregnant suffer from diminished speech, visual, and memory skills, as well as two to three times the odds of having attention, rule-breaking, and aggression problems.
