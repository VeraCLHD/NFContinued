Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.How often is poultry injected with phosphates? The vast majority of chicken products—more than 90%—were found to contain these additives, and most of the packages of meat did not list the additives on their label.Sometimes they call the phosphate additives “flavorings” or “broth,” and sometimes the labels don’t say anything at all. If they do list them, it will probably be one of these. I’d recommend minimizing one’s intake of anything with those four letters: p, h, o, s. They’re also used in a lot in junk foods and fast food. This one has phosphorus and aluminum. You see this a lot in processed cheese. One grilled cheese sandwich, and we may exceed the World Health Organization’s provisional tolerable daily intake of aluminum by 428%, in one sandwich.And, the food industry no longer has to list phosphorus content on the Nutrition Facts label.There certainly have been calls from the public health community to “mandate that [the] phosphorus content of foods be included [back] on [the] nutrition facts labels.” Good luck with that.
