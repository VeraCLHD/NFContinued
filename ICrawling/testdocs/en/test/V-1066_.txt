They took folks with mild cognitive impairment, and had them exercise 30 minutes a day for six months, versus a control group that just stretched for half an hour every day, instead of exercised.Here’s the data. They did a test of cognitive performance at the beginning, and then repeated it at the end of six months. As you can see, in that six-month period, those not exercising—just stretching—continued to decline. At the end of six months, both men and women got fewer correct answers than they did when they started.Now, what they were hoping for is that by adding exercise, they could slow down this decline. So, if instead of just stretching every day, if they were doing aerobic exercise instead, getting some blood to their brain, maybe they’d only decline half as much—or ideally, not at all—stay the same, have zero fewer correct answers.
