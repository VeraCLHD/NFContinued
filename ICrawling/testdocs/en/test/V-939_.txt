What if you or a loved one already has Alzheimer’s? The Processed Apples Institute funded a study suggesting apple juice may help prevent Alzheimer’s. But now they’re back. After changing their name to the Apple Products Research and Education Council, they funded a new study, in which, instead of dripping apple juice on nerve cells in a petri dish, they had 21 Alzheimer’s patients drink a cup of apple juice every day for a month to see what would happen. Works in the lab—but does it work in the nursing home? After a month of apple juice, no change in cognitive performance or day-to-day functioning, but they did report improvements in mood and behavior. Less apathy, anxiety, agitation, depression, and delusion. Did seem to hallucinate a bit more, though. But this was a tiny study, with no placebo control. But hey, there are worse things doctors give them than apple juice. Though if I were going to repeat the study, I’d choose pomegranate or purple grape. Though then, one would miss out on funds from Big Apple.
