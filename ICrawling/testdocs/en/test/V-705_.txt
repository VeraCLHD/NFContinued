What are they eating in New York? I bet it’s more than just big apples. You may remember me covering this study a few years ago, which showed that the primary sources of flame-retardant chemicals in the American diet (with the exception of infants, who get all the pollution straight from their moms) are meat, fish, dairy, and eggs. But, which kind of meat is the worst? We didn’t know, until recently. We know fish is the worst—and this is for halibut, which is actually one of the least contaminated. But, in terms of other meats, second only to fish in terms of contamination—poultry; then pork; then beef. What’s this one here, though, between chicken and fish? Turkey. So, bottom line: white meat is more contaminated with flame-retardant chemical pollutants than red, though the highest concentrations are actually found in dogs’ and cats’ food. What about polychlorinated naphthalenes? Until this study was published, “Information on the occurrence of [these] toxicologically significant [industrial pollutants] in food, or on human exposure, [was] sparse.”  “…PCNs…are chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons—a potentially vast group of little-known environmental contaminants of [human] origin,” whose chemical structure “can bestow a dioxin-like mode of toxic action.” Say no more. Though banned in many countries, which aisle might we still find the most in the grocery store? The bread shelves? The dairy case? Would it be in the deli? The egg section? Fish counter? Or, would it be in the produce department? The worst was fish, with the worst of the worst—farmed salmon—followed closely by organic salmon. Then comes poultry and eggs. Let’s zoom in a bit here. Red meat has less; the worst being lamb. Then comes dairy.
