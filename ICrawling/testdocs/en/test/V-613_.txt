To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.In my research on cinnamon, I ran across a peculiar paper, speculating that certain natural compounds of spices, such as nutmeg, may form “amphetamine-like compounds” within the body sufficient “to elevate the mood” and help provide “some added Christmas cheer” during the holiday season. This hypothetical risk was raised as far back as the 60s in the New England Journal, where it was pondered whether the age-old custom of adding nutmeg to eggnog arose from the “psychopharmacological effects described” in cases of nutmeg intoxication.Such cases evidently go back to the 1500s, where it was used as an abortifacent, to induce a miscarriage, and in the 1960s, as a psychotropic drug. The researchers conclude that while nutmeg “is much cheaper for use and probably less dangerous” than heroin, you don’t want to take too much.
