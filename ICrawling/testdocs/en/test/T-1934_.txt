Getting the right amount of vitamin A in one’s diet is important, since a deficiency can have very serious effects—such as childhood blindness. Many Americans do not get enough vitamin A, and other vital nutrients, in their daily diet. However, taking supplements may not be the right approach, since vitamin A supplements may decrease one’s lifespan.Foods high in vitamin A include red, orange, and yellow vegetables, as well as dark green leafy vegetables and boiled sweet potatoes. Some foods and supplements may lead to toxic levels of vitamin A, including cod liver oil, red snapper, and Herbalife supplements.
