You know the answer to this question: white rice versus brown rice? But what about the answer to this question: brown rice versus red rice? Ah, what the heck: brown, versus red, versus black rice; which is healthier? And the winner is…red rice! That was a surprise; I’ve been using black, but I just switched to red. Ten times more antioxidants than brown rice.The phytonutrients in these pigmented strains of rice may protect against heart disease, inhibit the growth of human cancer cells, and even help protect against asthma and hay fever, so I encourage folks to make the switch.To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
