Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.“Inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption” may kill millions around the globe every year, so the public health community is not beyond “appealing to vanity”— “health is intimately linked to attractiveness.”How do you tell if someone’s healthy? You look for that golden glow that comes from the carotenoids in fruits and vegetables, found to increase the attractiveness of African, Asian, and Caucasian faces. These are kind of before-and-after shots, with more and more fruits and vegetables as you go left to right. Most think the greater fruit and veggie group on the right appears healthier and more attractive. College students going from three servings a day to the recommended minimum of nine servings a day for just six weeks significantly improved skin color, and it’s “possible that even smaller dietary changes” could help as well. And, the worse we now eat, the more attractive we may become! Public health advocates hope this research, suggesting healthy eating may “affect mate choice” and “sexual selection” provides a powerful message for promoting healthy eating, towards boosting fruit and veggie intake up to 13 servings a day.
