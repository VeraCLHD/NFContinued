The British government has taken certain steps in diet-related laws and policies that the U.S. government has not. For example, they mandated that food manufacturers remove most of the artificial food colors from their products. In another step, the UKâ€™s National Health Service took a leading role in reducing carbon emissions through the food served to hospital patients, visitors, and staff. Their healthy, low-carbon menus include much less meat, dairy, and eggs than before, which prevents millions of tons of carbon from being released into the atmosphere. British and other tea drinkers were advised by the European Society of Cardiology to cut out the milk added to tea; numerous studies found that milk blocks the natural properties in tea that may improve arterial function.
