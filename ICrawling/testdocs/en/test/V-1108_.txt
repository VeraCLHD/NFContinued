What about Herbalife supplements? We were concerned about liver toxicity, and we’re still concerned about liver toxicity. We think it may be because it has too much vitamin A. In fact, there have even been calls to have all animal-based vitamin A supplements just pulled from the shelves, because of concerns about safety.Of course, it’s naturally found in fish. This year, from the Journal of Food Protection: someone ate some red snapper, and got vitamin A poisoning. Just a few hours after ingestion, headaches, vomiting, fever, visual disorientation, followed by peeling of the skin. This poor 41-year-old guy suffered serious peeling of the skin that took more than three months to heal.
