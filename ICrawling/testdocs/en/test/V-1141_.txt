Last year we learned that vitamin A and vitamin E supplements weren’t just a waste of money, but we were actually paying to live, on average, a shorter life—whereas vitamin D supplements were shown to increase our lifespan. Let’s keep filling in the alphabet: vitamin C. Did scientists just discover that vitamin C supplements shorten our lifespan? Don’t do anything to our lifespan? Or do vitamin C supplements enable us to live longer? No effect on lifespan, heart attack risk, or cancer risk—just, apparently, a waste of money.
