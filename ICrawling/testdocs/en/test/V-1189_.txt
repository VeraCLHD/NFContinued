What about coconut milk, though, which is rich in MCFAs? Harmful anyway? Harmless? Or helpful? Some may remember those studies from 2007 that showed that an Egg McMuffin was McDeath on our arteries, olive oil didn’t do anything, and walnuts showed an immediate benefit. Well, that experiment was repeated, but this time with coconut milk. And the arterial reaction to coconut milk was as bad as the McDonald's. What about the whole food, though? Flaked coconut, which is just whole dried coconut. Research on defatted coconut flakes shows a cholesterol-lowering effect. That’s no surprise; all whole plant foods have fiber, and fiber lowers our cholesterol. But this was for coconut flakes with the fat taken out, which isn’t available commercially. What about just regular flaked coconut that you'd buy in a store? The fat part—the coconut oil—is bad, but the nonfat part of coconuts is good. Put them both together, and does the fat win out, making it harmful? Do they cancel each other out? Or does the fiber win out, making both flaked and whole coconuts helpful? I’ll give you a hint: she thinks flaked coconut’s just yummy. And the answer is: just harmless, based on studies of coconut-eating Malaysians.
