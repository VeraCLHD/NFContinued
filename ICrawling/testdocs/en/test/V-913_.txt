I’ve talked in the past about the biogenic amines, like spermine and cadaverine, that can be formed in decomposing tissues. But a new review on the human toxicological effects of these substances in our diet suggests that putrescine may have carcinogenic (cancer-causing) effects. Putrescine is a chemical compound of decay that contributes to the smell of putrefying flesh, and the fishy odor of certain vaginal infections. But it’s found even in non-spoiled fish, meat, cheese, and fermented foods. We can’t stay away from it, though, unless we know which foods have the most. Here’s a dozen commonly eaten foods they tested: beer, blue cheese, feta cheese, kimchi, miso, sauerkraut, sardines, sausage, soy sauce, tempeh, tuna, and wine. Which do you think has the most? Sardines were runner-up, but the highest levels are found in tuna. To stay away from putrescine, we should stay away from canned fish. There’s a recommendation that we should try to stick under 40mg in a meal. So just a couple bites, a quarter of a serving of tuna, and we’re over the limit. But it would take two servings of sausages, or like ten beers, to approach the limit otherwise.
