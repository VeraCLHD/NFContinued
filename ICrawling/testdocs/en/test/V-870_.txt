Realizing that the link between meat and cancer is so strong—particularly processed meat—a new article in the journal Meat Science asked, “Should we become vegetarians, or can we make meat safer?” There’s a bunch of additives, for example, that can suppress the toxic effects of heme iron, the blood iron that’s found in meat. These additives are still under study, but could provide an acceptable way to prevent colon cancer, because evidently avoiding meat is just out of the question.I mean, if the National Cancer Institute recommendations to reduce meat consumption were adhered to, sure, cancer incidence may be reduced—but farmers and the meat industry would suffer important economic problems.
