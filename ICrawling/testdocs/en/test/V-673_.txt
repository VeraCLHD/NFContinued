How does our immune system know what to attack, and what not to attack? As I described, the clonal selection theory of immunity suggests that we start out able to fend off basically every cellular structure in the known universe, because we have a billion different types of antibody-producing B cells—each capable of recognizing a different molecular signature.Why, then, do we tend not to attack ourselves? It’s because before we’re even born, we kill off each and every B cell that recognizes us. It’s called clonal deletion; the killing off of forbidden clones. That’s what our thymus gland is for. When we’re still a fetus, our body lines up all our immune cells (our B cells, our T cells), holds up a picture of our self, and asks them, one by one: “do you recognize this person?” And if any of our immune cells say yes, they’re shot in the head. Killed on the spot; death by apopotosis, and good riddance.Turns out this process of clonal deletion—ridding our bodies of self-recognizing immune cells—happens throughout our lives, mostly in our bone marrow. If you remember, though, as I talked about before, IGF-1, the cancer-promoting growth hormone boosted by animal protein consumption, prevents apoptosis, prevents our body’s killing of cells it wants to get rid of. That may be why IGF-1 levels are linked to cancer.
