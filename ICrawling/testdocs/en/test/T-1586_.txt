The American Heart Association (AHA) advocates dietary and lifestyle changes for preventing heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions, and agree that these changes may be as effective or even better than medications. They came up with seven simple recommendations for lifestyle changes and have set modest goals for getting more Americans to practice them.Some dietary modifications the AHA recommends include decreasing salt, trans fat, saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol consumption and increasing the intake and variety of fruits and vegetables. They also recognize a link between prolonged sitting and increased mortality and advocate for daily exercise.
