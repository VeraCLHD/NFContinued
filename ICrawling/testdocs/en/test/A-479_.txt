The response to NutritionFacts.org has been overwhelming. Though only about 1% of visitors leave a question or comment, that still means more than a thousand questions/comments a month. My dreams of answering every one personally were swiftly dashed. I’m having a hard time just keeping up with my new-video-a-day promise! That’s why I need help. I’ll continue to answer as many queries as I possibly can on the site (especially those specific to the data I present), but many are just general nutrition questions that could be answered by most anyone with a nutrition background. So, if you’re a registered dietitian or licensed practitioner with a few hours to spare, I’m in desperate need of your help. Nutrition students and dietetics interns are welcome to contact me, too. Please email me directly at mhg1@cornell.edu. My goal is to make NutritionFacts.org the go-to source for advice about healthy eating. There are already hundreds of videos on more than 1,000 topics, but I’d love to take it to the next level and see this site become a place where people can come and get all their questions answered directly. For those without specific nutrition expertise or training there are still lots of ways to help out—email NutritionFactsInterns@gmail.com to get looped in. Even if you just have a few hours a week, we have a variety of critical site-building and outreach tasks for any experience level. Thank you to all of those already helping out!
