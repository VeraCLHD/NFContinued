One of the first clinical signs of the disease is changes in the sense of smell. A group of researchers at the University of Florida conducted a smell test, asking Alzheimer’s patients to smell a spoonful of peanut butter at a short distance from each nostril. The peanut butter had to get all the way up to two inches from the left nostril to be detected in all patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease.
