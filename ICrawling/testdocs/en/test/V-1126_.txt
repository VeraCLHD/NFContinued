These phytonutrients are wonderful, but is there a concern that our bodies can only absorb a certain amount of antioxidants at one time, so we should spread out our fruit and vegetable consumption? Like the law of diminishing returns—maybe we absorb only the phytonutrients in that first cup of strawberries, but if you eat two cups at one sitting, maybe absorption kind of plateaus. So maybe it’s better to eat one cup now, and the second in a few hours. We finally have some data. Is this fact, or fiction? Fiction. Here’s about one-, two-, and four-cup strawberry “treatments”, and the more you eat, the more you benefit, with no end in sight.
