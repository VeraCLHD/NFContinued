Americans spend about three billion dollars on homeopathy every year. I’ve talked previously about the near total lack of scientific evidence supporting homeopathy, but maybe I was wrong to dismiss it as just a waste of money. Maybe it can be even worse. I was surprised to read this new case report published in the European Journal of Pediatrics: A young girl almost killed by homeopathy. An overdose of a homeopathic remedy might seem a contradiction in terms, but just because they’re no better than a sugar pill doesn’t mean you can stuff babies full of sugar pills. Many homeopathic pills are made of xylitol, which can have a laxative effect, and cause diarrhea— which, if untreated in an infant, can turn into severe life-threatening metabolic acidosis, and land her in the ICU. Hence the title: “Too much of too little.”High-dose homeopathy is also something you might want to keep away from Fido.
