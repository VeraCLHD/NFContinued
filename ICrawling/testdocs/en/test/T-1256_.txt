Mother Nature probably won’t fit in a pill anytime soon. Multivitamin use does not appear to offer any longevity benefit and is associated with increased risk of breast and prostate cancer.  A meta-analysis on multivitamin and mineral supplements found no evidence that supplements affected CVD, cancer, or all causes of mortality in individuals without nutritional deficiencies. Some have speculated that copper in multivitamins may be contributing to the Alzheimer’s epidemic. Vitamin E, Vitamin A, and Beta Carotene supplements may increase mortality rates and antioxidant supplementation failed to lower the incidence of many age related disorders. Mega dosing antioxidant supplements is not a good substitute for antioxidant rich plant foods. Lutein is similarly better obtained from produce, not pills, despite the minor decline in the nutrient content of crops. A minimum of nine servings per day of fruits and vegetables is recommended over taking multivitamin supplements. Eating a combination of polynutrients found in real food was shown to reduce the DNA damage caused by IR (Ionizing Radiation) while supplements failed to show the same results. Taking Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 supplements, however, are recommended for those at risk for deficiency.
