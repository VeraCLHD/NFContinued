Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. The jury is finally in on stevia.  The reason it’s been such a long time coming is that research out of Japan in the 90s found that steviosides, the active ingredient in stevia, appeared totally harmless. But, in the guts of rats, intestinal bacteria transformed steviosides into something called steviol—which is toxic, causing a big spike in mutagenic DNA damage. So, the question was: do we have those same rat bacteria in our guts? And, it turns out we do. So, we know that when we eat stevia, mutagenic compounds are produced in our colons and absorbed into our bloodstream. The only remaining question was, how much? The World Health Organization just released their latest evaluation of food additives, and they consider up to 4 mg/kg of body weight, safe. So, that’s 1.8 mg per pound.  So if you multiply your weight in pounds times 1.8, that’s how many milligrams of stevia compounds you should stay under.
