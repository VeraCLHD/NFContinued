Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. Last year, I presented the study on poultry slaughterhouse workers, where they were found to have excess cancers of the mouth, nasal cavities, throat, tonsils, inner ear cancer, sinus cancer, esophageal, rectal, liver, leukemia, etc.—thought to be because they were exposed to cancer-causing viruses present in poultry and poultry products, and worse, that it may be “transmitted to anyone in the general population…handling [or eating] inadequately cooked [chicken].”It’s not clear how you’re supposed to not handle raw chicken—unless you can levitate it into the oven through telekinesis? The study was replicated recently in the largest such investigation to date, more than 20,000 workers in poultry slaughtering and packing plants. They found the same thing, confirming the findings of three other studies to date: “that workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants have increased risk of dying from certain cancers…New findings [though, in this study] were [increased risk of death from] cancers of the cervix and penis.”
