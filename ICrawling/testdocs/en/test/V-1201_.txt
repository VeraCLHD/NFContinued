The next game we’re going to play is called "Better than Nothing?" I’ll throw something up, and you’ll try to decide if what I have pictured is even worth trying.First up? Head lice are nasty; really nasty. But so is covering our kids with insecticides, like permethrin, the standard treatment for head lice. So it’s no wonder there are all sorts of alternative treatments out there. But do they work?One was finally put to the test: Paramide Plus coconut oil emulsion shampoo. Is it better than nothing, even though it may potentially delay more effective treatments? Better than nothing? Or, do you think, “If I have blood-sucking lice on my child’s head, I’m going for the big guns?"Researchers went into 12 elementary schools, and after a week of insecticide treatments, 14% of the kids were cured. After a week of the coconut-derived shampoo, though, 61% were cured. Worked four times better, and no pesticide exposure.
