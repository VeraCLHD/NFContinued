I had to look that one up myself. It turns out there are bunch of fish that store large amounts of waxy substances in their bodies, and if we eat them, the accumulation of the indigestible wax in our rectums, through consumption of these fish, engenders rectal discharges or leakage of orange or brownish-green oil.Keriorrhea is greasy orange anal leakage. Keri is the greek word for wax.
