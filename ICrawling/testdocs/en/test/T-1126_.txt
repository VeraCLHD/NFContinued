Fatty foods have been shown to be a leading cause of obesity and may actually be addictive. And substituting just 1% of saturated fat in your diet can add nearly a whole year’s worth of length to our telomeres (telomere length is a measure of cellular aging).  Consuming less animal fat may reduce cholesterol. Consuming more plant-based fat in the form of whole foods, though, such as those found in nuts and avocados, may actually be good for you. Some vitamins and other phytonutrients are fat-soluble, meaning they are best absorbed in combination with a source of fat, so choosing a low-fat or fat-free salad dressing to top your salad may not be as good for you (unless you add some walnuts or other healthy source of fat on top).
