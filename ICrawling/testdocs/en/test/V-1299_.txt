The fiber in flax seeds and other whole plant foods is about more than just reducing our risk for the #1 and #2 killers of Americans—heart disease and cancer.

The biggest study on bowel movement frequency in history was recently published, comparing the bowel habits of 15,000 meat eaters to 5,000 vegetarians and 1,000 vegans.

Vegans, for example, were about 3 times more likely to have daily BMs. Like I always said, vegans are just regular people.
