Next scenario: you’re on a plane, and the flight attendant asks what you want to drink, and you think to yourself, which is healthiest? You're offered a variety of soft drinks, water, cranberry juice cocktail, hot tea, orange juice from concentrate, tomato juice from concentrate, hot coffee, and apple juice from concentrate. Which is the healthiest? Is it the ginger ale, because ginger is so amazing? Is it water—doesn't everyone say water is the best thing to drink? The berry juice? The vegetable juice? Any of these others? Another tough one. Ready to vote?Who thinks the healthiest thing up there is the ginger ale? The water? The cranberry juice? The tea? Orange juice? Tomato juice? Coffee? And who thinks the healthiest drink during your flight is apple juice? The answer is, the tea.Even without the sugar and the soda in cranberry juice; even without all the sodium in the tomato juice, tea has all the water of water, but also has, as a bonus, more antioxidants than anything else on that drink menu. And make sure to ask for a lemon wedge. Of course, you're lucky if you even get drinks on planes these days.
