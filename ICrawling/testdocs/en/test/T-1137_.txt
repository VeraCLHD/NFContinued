Lymphoma is cancer of the lymph nodes, which are dense collections of white blood cells embedded in a matrix of microscopic fibers and channels located throughout the body (neck, armpit, groin, etc.). The mortality rate varies with the kind and extent of lymphoma and many other factors. Depending on the type and extent of the disease, lymphoma is usually treated with chemotherapy. As with all cancers, lymphoma seems to be the result of a genetic mutation that causes out-of-control cell growth. In the largest ever prospective study of diet and cancer, poultry was associated with the highest risk of lymphoma; for every 50 grams of poultry consumed daily, the risk of lymphoma may increase anywhere from 50% to nearly 400%. Viruses may also have a role in cancer. Studies on bovine leukemia virus, a viral infection in cattle that can make its way into milk, suggest that dairy– and egg-borne viruses may play a role in causing lymphoma (and leukemia—cancer of cells in the blood). This suggests that, in some cases, some types of lymphoma and leukemia may actually be zoonotic diseases–disease in animals that causes disease in humans. Given the strength of evidence associating cancer with animal products, decreasing or eliminating animal products from the diet may provide significant benefits. A diet rich in vegetables, grains, fruit, and nuts has been shown to provide crucial anti-cancer advantages.
