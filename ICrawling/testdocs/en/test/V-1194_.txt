Speaking of which, does an apple a day really keep people like me away? By which I mean, is there scientific evidence that just one apple a day has significant, measurable benefits? Remember, the recommended minimum number of fruit and vegetable servings is nine a dayâ€”minimum. Is a single apple going to do anything? What do you think? An apple a day, fact or fiction?Fact. A major recent review found that compared to those eating less than an apple a day, those eating just one or more had less risk of oral cancer, less cancer of the larynx, less breast cancer, less colon cancer, less kidney cancer, and less ovarian cancer.This makes sense, given new research showing, for example, that apple peels have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative effects on human cancer cells in a Petri dish. The higher the apple concentration, the more the growth rates of the human cancer cells dropped, compared to control. Same with breast cancer. And apples seem to work best against estrogen receptor negative breast cancer, which is much harder to treat than estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.How do apples do what they do? Those of you who have seen my Stopping Cancer DVD will recognize these stages of tumor formation. Carcinogens cause DNA mutations, and then oxidation, inflammation, and hormones cause it to grow, and finally metastasize.Which steps do apples block? All of them. Antimutagenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects, and even immune enhancement, to help clear out any budding tumors. Eat at least an apple a day.
