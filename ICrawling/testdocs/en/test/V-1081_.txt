A review last year looked at all the randomized controlled trials to date. Using a meat-eating group as the control, it compared people eating like a Mediterranean-style diet that minimizes meat, versus a meat-free diet, versus a meat-, dairy- and egg-free diet.You can’t really directly compare all the studies, because they were all on slightly different diets, for different durations, studying different populations of people. But in general, people cutting out most meat cut out a quarter of their risk. Those cutting out all meat cut their risk of our #1 killer in half, and those who eliminated dairy and eggs did even better still.But, there are two popular styles of vegan diets—there are those pushing very low fat versus those that encourage high-fat whole food sources, like nuts. Which one works better?
