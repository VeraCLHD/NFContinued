The Mediterranean Diet appears to be a healthier alternative to the Standard American Diet, but it seems that the nuts (including walnuts) and vegetables are the components of the diet associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. Fat is needed to maximize the absorption of certain important phytonutrients, and adding nuts to a fat-free salad may be better than using extra virgin olive oil. English walnuts may be among the best nuts for arterial health as well as for pancreatic and breast cancer prevention. Bodily inflammatory disease risk is dramatically lowered with just half a walnut or a little bit of peanut butter daily. Walnuts can counteract the drop in male fertility associated with saturated fat intake by improving sperm quality. Walnuts can help you to lose weight by burning fat and may even lower depression risk.
