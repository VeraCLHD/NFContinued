Vegetarians appear to have a better overall mood when compared to omnivores.

Orange aromatherapy may decrease anxiety while increasing concentration, and lavender may be more effective than benzodiazepine drugs like valium.

It appears music can be medicinal, but you might want to make it Mozart to maximize your mood.
