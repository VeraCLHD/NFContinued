There is some bad news, though, for those trying to eat healthy. Dietary intake studies have shown that vegans, on average, are not getting the recommended daily intake of three nutrients: calcium, iodine, and vitamin B12. Using the same criteria. though, omnivores are deficient in seven nutrients: calcium, iodine, and five others. Still, the EPIC Study found this year that vegans not getting enough calcium have increased bone fracture risk. Those getting enough—600 milligrams a day—were fine.But you know, it’s not enough to just understand intellectually that plant-based sources of nutrients are superior. We need to put it into practice. The calcium in kale and broccoli is absorbed nearly twice as well as the calcium in milk. But we cut our absorption rate down to zero if we let our greens rot in the fridge, or we never buy them in the first place. It would be nice if we could somehow absorb the nutrients in fruits and veggies just by staring at them in the produce aisle, but no, we actually have to eat them.
