In the U.S., though, children have the highest levels of these carcinogens in their bodies. And these chemicals may play a role in our childhood asthma epidemic as well.Two things seem to do it: meat intake, and the presence of smokers in the home. So, parents need to be educated to take certain precautions: no indoor smoking, and reducing their children’s intake of grilled and smoked meat, so as to decrease their exposure to these carcinogens.Now, warnings about meat in general are kind of vague, though. Where are these carcinogens found most? Flame-broiled burger, or fried? Pan-fried chicken? Lamb chop, pork chop, or grilled salmon?Salmon is bad, but for the first time, it seems, chicken beats out fish for carcinogenic contamination.Chickens aren’t the only things roasted, though. What about coffee beans? Measured for the first time this year, but, they don’t have any muscles, so they contributed only “very insignificant quantities.”And an earlier study found zero mutagenicity from frying veggie burgers; again, they’re not “muscle meat.” The carcinogen is created from the muscle itself—in fact, it’s been detected in roasted human muscle too, though I don’t know why they even did that study.
