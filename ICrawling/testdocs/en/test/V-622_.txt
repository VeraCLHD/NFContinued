Drug companies are hoping to capitalize on the fact that the consumption of certain plants appears to lower the risk of diabetes, by isolating the active components for use and sale as pharmacological agents. Though not as profitable, why not just eat the plants? One plant in particular that’s now been tested is flax. We’ve known for twenty years that having ground flax seeds in your stomach can blunt the blood sugar spike from a meal. But, it’s never been tested in diabetics—until now.“An open-label study on the effect of flax seed powder…supplementation in the management of diabetes…” A tablespoon of ground flax seeds every day, for a month, and, compared to the control group, a significant drop in fasting blood sugars, triglycerides, and cholesterol—as well as the most important thing, a drop in A1C level. This was just after a month, though if one’s sugars are already well-controlled, there may be no additional benefit. No weight gain was reported in people adding a quarter cup of ground flax a day to their diets for three months. In fact, the flax group ended up with a slimmer waist than the flax seed oil or control group. Even up to nearly a half cup a day—more than I’d recommend—still no significant weight gain, though this was only after a month. How does flax help control diabetes? Well, flax seed consumption may improve insulin sensitivity in people with glucose intolerance. After 12 weeks of flax, there was a small, but significant, drop in insulin resistance—perhaps related to the drop in oxidant stress, given the antioxidant qualities of flax seed phytonutrients.
