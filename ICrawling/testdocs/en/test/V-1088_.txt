There’s another inflammatory autoimmune condition called oral lichen planus, in which your immune system starts attacking the lining of your mouth. This is what it looks like. It’s actually not that rare—strikes up to 2% of the population. And there’s no cure, and the available treatments are pretty nasty in themselves—steroids, immunosuppressants. Sometimes, the lesions can even turn into cancer. Thankfully, scientists just discovered a new treatment. A treatment with no side effects. A treatment leading to remarkable clinical improvement in the vast majority of patients—even total remission. And it’s just a plant; a simple, common plant. Which one is it? Is it artichokes, celery root, fiddlehead ferns, Jerusalem artichokes—which are actually the roots of sunflowers, hence the term sunchoke—purslane, or watercress? I gave a hint when I said it was a common plant; it is, in fact, one of the most common plants in the world. Purslane.
