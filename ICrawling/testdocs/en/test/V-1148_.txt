Because mercury can be so dangerous, concern has been raised about amalgam fillings—the silvery cavity fillings in our teeth—because they do contain mercury, and release a certain amount every day. Eating just a single can of tuna a week, though, is equivalent to having how many mercury-containing fillings in our mouth, day in and day out? Less than 5? 5-10? 15? 20? 25? Or more than 25? Now, keep in mind, you have only 32 teeth. One can a week is like living with 29 mercury-containing fillings. I don’t know if you remember those old James Bond flicks, but basically that means looking like this.
