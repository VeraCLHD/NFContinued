Speaking of potential DNA damage, fact or fiction? Cell phones can give you brain cancer. The incidence of brain tumors has been increasing over the last 25 years—but is it because of mobile phones? Fact, or fiction?Fact. A major review in the International Journal of Oncology was published last year. If you don’t use cell phones, your lifetime risk of developing a brain tumor is about 1 in 167. If you do use cell phones, your lifetime risk is still really small—but it goes up from 1 in 167 to 1 in 128. That’s still less than a 1% chance you’re ever going to get a brain tumor, but it’s best to use a headset, or the speakerphone option, and limit the time children use them.
