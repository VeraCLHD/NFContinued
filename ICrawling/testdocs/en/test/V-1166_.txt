Okay, here’s another fascinating study. Published last year in the Journal of Biomedical Optics, and comes straight out of science fiction. They used an argon laser to measure, in real time, the levels of antioxidants in people’s bodies. Antioxidant substances in living human skin.We know that eating fruits and vegetables boosts our antioxidant levels, while stress, on the other hand, eats at our stores of antioxidants—causing our levels to drop. But how fast does this all happen? What are the dynamics of it? We didn’t know, until this study.And while they were taking measurements, they had people take diaries—when they were sick, tired, eating tomato sauce, or up partying all night. And so they came up with graphs like this—tracking antioxidant levels, and linking them to life events. So here, for example, things are going fine; then stress at work. Eats more fruits and veggies; but then starts not getting enough sleep. More fruit and veggie consumption again; then gets a bad cold—drops him way down before slowly starting to recover.Their most important finding was that antioxidant levels can plummet within two hours of a stressful event. You get stuck in traffic, agitated, breathing in car exhaust, and your body starts using up antioxidant stores left and right.Takes two hours to lose, and can take up to three days to get our levels back up again. So the take-home message is that especially when we’re sick, stressed, tired, we need to be soaking our bodies in antioxidants—which means fruits and vegetables at every meal and snack, and sipping green tea all day long.They’ve actually used this same laser technology to tightly correlate the development of wrinkles with low antioxidant levels in the skin. So, even if you don’t care what’s going on inside your body, you should eat healthy for the outside too.
