Nutritional reductionism refers to a focus on individual food compounds (e.g., protein, vitamins, antioxidants) as opposed to a holistic approach that focuses on food habits and the relationship between diet and health.  Reductionism is common in nutritional research and also in food and supplement production and marketing.A “deficiency mentality” related to disease—i.e., that a disease is caused by a lack of a particular compound—supports a reductionist philosophy. Diseases such as scurvy have been treated successfully with vitamin extracts. Thus scientists and doctors are trained to find the “magic bullet” to cure a disease, an approach that is not successful in treating modern chronic diseases.Another motivation for reductionism in nutrition research is that there are billions of dollars to be made in the supplement industry. At least 5,000 phytonutrients in plants have been discovered so far linked to the possibility of decreasing risk of major chronic diseases. The supplement industry can make money selling individual compounds; whole foods do not offer the same profit potential.Studies show that eating a variety of whole plant foods increases the positive nutritional benefits above the sum of the individual plant components. Pills cannot mimic the effects of plant food nutrient synergies. Further, components in plant foods extracted out individually may lose their bioavailability or behave differently than when naturally contained in the plants.There are many examples showing the failure of the reductionist approach in nutritional research, including:
