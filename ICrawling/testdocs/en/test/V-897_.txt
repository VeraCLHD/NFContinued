Should we really try to go out of our way to make higher antioxidant choices? Isn’t it enough just to eat lots of fruits and vegetables? Does it really matter which ones we eat?Yes, it does. Check out this new study. They took two dozen folks; had them eat a high-antioxidant diet, and a low-antioxidant diet. But here’s the catch. Throughout, they ate the same number of fruits and vegetables—the same amount of fiber, etc.So, while on the high-antioxidant diet, they were eating, like, berries and citrus, and on the low-antioxidant diet, they had to stick to wimpier choices—like lettuce and bananas. But same amount.This is what happened to the level of inflammation within their bodies. Those switching from their regular diet to an even lower antioxidant diet saw the levels of C-reactive protein in their bodies rise 40%, whereas those switching to the high-antioxidant diet saw their levels drop—even though both groups were eating the same number of servings of fruits and vegetables every day.So, quality counts, not just quantity.To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
