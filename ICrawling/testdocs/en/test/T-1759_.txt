The bigger our bowel movements, the healthier we may be. Low stool weight appears to lower our colon health and may increase the risk of colon cancer, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and constipation. The target minimum fecal output is 200 grams or about a half pound a day.The link between stool size and colon disease may be related to transit time. The larger our stool, the quicker the transit time, and the easier it is for our intestines to move things along. For vegetarians, it should take between 24 to 36 hours to reach the half-pound target. Those on the standard American diet, however, may be looking at a four to five-day transit time.Populations whoÂ eat high-fiber diets have been shown to have low rates of diverticulosis. More than 50% of African-Americans in their 50s were found to have diverticulosis, compared to less than 1% of Africans eating traditional plant-based diets.The high antioxidants and fiber in fruit and vegetables seem to alter the gut flora and have been shown to double stool size. Probiotics might also be helpful in increasing stool size while at the same time lowering depression.
