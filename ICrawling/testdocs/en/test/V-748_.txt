Our friendly flora’s digestion of fiber also yields another short-chain fatty acid called butyrate, which may fight against cancer by slowing the growth of colon cancer cells and activating programmed cancer cell death—as well as preventing cancer in the first place. Butyrate may explain why fiber-filled, plant-based diets are so anti-inflammatory.A recent review concluded that butyrate seems “to exert broad anti-inflammatory activities,” and might be a good candidate “to evaluate in the fight against obesity-associated and systemic inflammation in general.” Now they’re alluding to using it as some kind of supplement, but we can produce more on our own, naturally, by two ways.Number one is eating more plant foods, since it’s a by-product of fiber digestion. And number two, we can boost the number of butyrate-producing bacteria in our colon by—eating more plant foods!“[D]ifferent butyrate production capacity in individuals according to diet.” Not only do those eating vegetarian harbor more good bacteria, period; vegetarian fecal samples showed the highest number of copies of butyrate-producing genes.
