Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. Dates are whole foods, but, by weight, are 80% pure sugar. Just to put that in perspective, Froot Loops are only 40% sugar. Half the sugar content of dates—and has fruit-shaped marshmallows—so it’s got to be healthy. Straight frosting? Only 60% sugar. Jelly beans? Only 70% sugar. Dates: 80%.Yes, dates have fiber; they have phytonutrients. But the concern about consuming high-sugar foods is that they can raise our blood sugar, raise our triglycerides, oxidatively stress our bodies, and make us fat. So, last year, Israeli scientists took a bunch of people, stuffed them full of dates for a month, and measured what happened. Are dates bad for us? Do the sugar and fiber kind of cancel each other out? Or are dates good for us? Dates are fantastic. No adverse effects on blood sugar or weight, and beneficial improvements in triglycerides and antioxidant stress levels. Check out the title of this review: “Possible…best food…?” Concluding that “dates may be considered as an almost ideal food.”
