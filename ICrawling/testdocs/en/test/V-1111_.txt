What about coffee? There’s some new data on coffee and liver cancer. Should coffee still be considered good for us? Yes. We knew it decreased our risk of diabetes, and, there’s new evidence to support that. But what we didn’t know, until last year, is that it protects us from liver cancer as well, protects us from brain cancer, and protects us from death; decreased all-cause mortality. This should not be a surprise. What is coffee, but beans and water? It’s a plant food. You know how soybeans have those healthy phytoestrogens? Well, now we know; so does coffee. The reason I do not recommend drinking coffee is that there is something even healthier to drink instead, and that’s tea. Coffee is beans in water; tea is dark green leafies in water, and though both are healthy, certainly, greens beat out beans—and pretty much everything else.
