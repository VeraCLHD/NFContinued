Does it have to be all or nothing, though? Researchers at the University of Texas followed a few hundred men after they had their prostates removed for cancer, and split them into a high saturated fat group and a low saturated fat group, and asked the simple question: does just cutting down on meat improve cancer-free survival? Now this was Texas, so that meant comparing those who ate the equivalent of three-quarters of a bucket of fried chicken's worth of saturated fat, to those eating half a bucket’s worth a day. The question is, did that modest drop in meat consumption significantly improve cancer-free survival, or do you really have to cut out all meat to see a significant effect? This is how long men lived before their cancer came back, eating that much saturated fat a day. Those who ate less saturated fat got this far out before their cancer returned. Less than 20 months, versus more than 40 months. That’s the difference even a quarter bucket of chicken's worth of saturated fat may make, if we have cancer. Obviously, cutting out all saturated animal fat is better, but it’s not all or nothing.
