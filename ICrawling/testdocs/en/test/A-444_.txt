Every year I scour the world’s scholarly literature on clinical nutrition pulling together what I find to be the most interesting, practical, and groundbreaking science on how best to feed ourselves and our families. I start with the 12,000 or so papers published annually on human nutrition and, thanks to a crack team of volunteers, am able to whittle those down to about 3,000 studies, which are downloaded, read, analyzed, and churned into a few hundred short videos so I can post a new video every day, year-round, to NutritionFacts.org. This certainly makes the site unique. There’s no other science-based source for free daily video updates on the latest discoveries in nutrition. The problem is that the amount of information can be overwhelming.
