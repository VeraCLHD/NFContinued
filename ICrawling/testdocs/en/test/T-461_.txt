Cinnamon is a great source of antioxidants. As is true for a lot of spices, cinnamon provides nutrition without calories.  Some herbs and spices, including cinnamon, are so rich in antioxidants that just a small pinch can double your antioxidant intake for one meal. Cinnamon is also one of the cheapest source antioxidants you can buy.  You can try using it in this pumpkin pie recipe. Ceylon (true) cinnamon may be safer than the more common cassia (Chinese) cinnamon due to the compound, coumarin, present in cassia cinnamon which data suggests may be toxic to the liver in quantities of one or more teaspoons per day.  However, you don’t have to be concerned about getting too many oxalates as you do with turmeric. While cinnamon is chock full of antioxidants, it may not be an effective treatment for diabetes.
