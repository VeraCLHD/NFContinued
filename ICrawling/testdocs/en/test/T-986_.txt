India’s population has low rates of Alzheimer’s, cancer, childhood allergies, and asthma—as well as highly frequent bowel movements—why are they so much healthier? It may be because a larger portion of the population consumes a plant-based diet.The Indian gooseberry, or amla, is among the most antioxidant-rich food on Earth. These berries have been shown to decrease cholesterol, inflammation, and cancer cell growth in vitro. Indian gooseberries were shown to decrease breast cancer cell spread in a laboratory model of metastasis as much as a chemotherapy drug.Just one Indian gooseberry a day may decrease cholesterol in as little as three weeks, while two a day may decrease blood sugar in diabetics as much as some of the leading medications.Another staple in the Indian culture is turmeric, a spice featured in curry. Curcumin is the pigment within turmeric that gives it its yellow color. Smokers taking curcumin supplements appear able to decrease the level of carcinogens in their body.
