Almonds are exceptionally healthy nuts. Research has shown that almonds and other nuts do not tend to contribute to weight gain, and in fact may help with weight control. They may also protect against DNA damage and lower cholesterol. The benefits of almonds can be reaped when eaten either cooked or raw.
