The leading cause of blindness and vision loss is cataracts, one of the most common surgeries performed today. We know smoking can increase risk; long-term radiation exposure—what about diet? A study of more than 25,000 people with a wide range of diets was recently published. They compared what they called “high” meat-eaters to “moderate” meat-eaters to “low” meat-eaters, versus those who “ate fish but no other meat,” versus those eating “vegetarian,” versus those eating “vegan.”The researchers went out of their way to choose health-conscious subjects, so they could factor out smoking, exercise, and other non-diet variables. And so the so-called “high” meat-consuming group—100 grams a day. That’s like one serving in one meal a day. In the U.S., we average about 330 grams a day. So it’s like reverse Starbucks labeling. You know how their small is a “tall”? Well, here, their “high” meat group is really quite low by American standards. Yet they still found a highly significant trend. Who do you think had the lowest risk of cataracts?Compared with the “high” meat group, cutting back on meat cuts down your risk about 15%. Just do fish, you’re down 21%. No fish, 30% drop in risk. And then, no eggs and dairy for the full 40% drop in risk. Overall, compared with meat-eaters who consumed 100 grams of meat and meat products a day, fish-eaters, vegetarians, and vegans had approximately 20%, 30%, and 40% lower risk of cataracts, respectively.It’s like with the diabetes risk; there appears to be a stepwise reduction, “a progressive decrease in risk in parallel with [the decrease in] the amount of meat and other animal products in the diet.”
