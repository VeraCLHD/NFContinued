Previously, we’ve looked at the safety of the preservative sodium benzoate. But what about potassium sorbate, commonly used to prevent mold growth in cheese, yogurt, wine, dried meat, pickles, apple cider, and many herbal dietary supplements? Harmful, harmless, or helpful? Well, it’s been found harmless to Syrian hamsters, but toxic to Chinese hamsters. Then, they discovered it’s actually harmless to Chinese hamster ovary cells, just toxic to Chinese hamster lung cells—but harmless to mouse lung cells. Now rats are a whole ‘nother story. But what about human cells? Took us until now to find out: “Does potassium sorbate induce genotoxic or mutagenic effects in lymphocytes [human lymphocytes, white blood cells]?” The paper concludes: “Based on our…results, consumers should be made aware that [potassium sorbate] should be considered a genotoxic and mutagenic compound.”
