Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.In my comparison of the antioxidant content of 282 beverages last year, hibiscus tea came out number one. So, my family switched from drinking matcha (green tea) to the hibiscus fruit punch recipe I shared in that video. We have since switched from using tea bags to just bulk dried hibiscus flowers, which we soak, and then blenderize into the tea, so we don’t throw anything away.But, just because something has antioxidant power in a test tube doesn’t mean it has antioxidant flower power in the body. Maybe the phytonutrients aren’t even absorbed. They were found to be bioavailable in rodents—but, I haven’t had a pet hamster since I was a kid. We didn’t know about humans, until now.“Consumption of [a] Hibiscus…aqueous extract [in other words, tea] and its impact on systemic antioxidant potential in healthy [human] subjects.” If you take people and have them just drink water, basically, for ten hours, this is what happens to the antioxidant level in their bloodstream. Your antioxidants get slowly used up throughout the day, fighting off all those free radicals, unless you replenish your antioxidant stores.Now, it’s hard to get people to fast for ten hours, so, in addition to water, they gave the study subjects something they knew wouldn’t mess up their antioxidant measurements—white bread and cheese. So, this is what happens when you eat water, white bread, and Gouda all day.
