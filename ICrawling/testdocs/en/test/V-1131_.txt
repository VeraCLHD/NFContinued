What about sweet potatoes? Bad, eh, or good? They’re not good; they’re great! Ranked as one of the top ten healthiest foods on the planet by Mayo Clinic. So, sweet potatoes good; white potatoes bad. If you insist on continuing to eat white potatoes, peel them, as that removes about three-quarters of the toxins.
