Okay, so it really is the chicken; but which chicken? Researchers last year tested the levels of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in chicken samples from McDonald’s, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Chili’s, TGI Friday’s, Outback Steakhouse, and Applebee’s. Which was worse? You tell me. One hundred samples of chicken were taken, and every single one of the hundred was contaminated. But which one took the cancer cake? Applebee’s has a grilled chicken salad; Burger King and Chick-fil-A both have chicken sandwiches; Chili’s has a “guiltless” chicken platter; Micky D’s has a grilled chicken salad; Outback has barbequed chicken; and TGI Friday’s a grilled chicken salad. Which is worse? It was that chicken salad from Friday’s. The researchers conclude: “Simple steps, such as reducing or avoiding the consumption of grilled chicken products…can be encouraged as a strategy to reduce one’s total intake of carcinogenic or mutagenic toxins.”
