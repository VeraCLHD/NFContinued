Now to be fair, the mercury isn’t just in fish. I mean what do you think happens when we feed fish meal to other farmed animals? You can get the worst of both worlds: saturated fat (with the industrial pollutants) and methyl mercury.Okay, we know that Nemo here is the worst out of all these options. But coming in second place? What do you think? Beef, butter, cheese, chicken, clams, or cream? Beef, butter, cheese, chicken, clams, and cream.Chicken: almost as much toxic waste ingestion as from fish.Cheese comes in third, and because of that, not eating meat may not be enough. From the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the most prestigious nutrition journal on the planet, and considered one of the most influential scientific journals of the 20th century: “Vegetarian diets and exposure to organochlorine pollutants, lead, and mercury.”Because we continue to feed farm animals to other farm animals in the United States—slaughterhouse waste, blood, and manure—not only may mad cow prions be found in meat, but also there are these persistent lipophilic organic pollutants, or “PLOP,” such as pesticides and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. Animal products can also contain other neurotoxic substances like methyl mercury and lead, because the industrial PLOP accumulates in fat tissues, the lead accumulates in bones, and so, when farm animals are fed meat and bone meal, the toxins biomagnify, bioaccumulate up the food chain.Therefore, a predominance of plant food in human diets, a plant-based diet, is an important step in lowering the body burden of harmful substances. But veganism is defined as the practice of consuming only plant foods.Although a vegetarian lifestyle can lower the body burden of PLOP, mercury, and lead, such benefits can be undermined by the consumption of contaminated milk and egg products, because farm animals that are fed contaminated animal products produce contaminated animal products.
