What do you think they found? Well, for periodontal disease, affecting the tissues surrounding the teeth, like gingivitis (gum disease), one of the leading causes of tooth loss, plant-based diets should be protective.After all, inflammation “is now recognized as one of the key underlying [causal] factors in periodontal disease.” And, we know saturated fats “produce an inflammatory response.” And so, no surprise, this recent study found that “High dietary [saturated fat intake] was significantly associated with a greater number of periodontal disease events.” Saturated fat, which comes primarily, in the American diet, from basically, dairy, donuts, and chicken. The same diet that leads to high cholesterol may also contribute to periodontitis, as bad cholesterol levels may be a risk factor for both. People with periodontal disease also suffer from arterial dysfunction. Wait a second: inflammation, high cholesterol, and arterial dysfunction; is it any wonder there may be an “Association Between Chronic Periodontitis and…Erectile Dysfunction?”  By looking in your mouth, your dentist may learn more about you than you realize. We know we can reverse impotence with a plant-based diet—what about periodontal disease? A new study found that “higher intake of high-fiber foods, especially fruits, [may at least help slow] periodontal disease progression…”
