To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.As we’ve seen, the cooked meat carcinogen, PhIP, can cause DNA mutations that may initiate a tumor, may then promote the growth of the cancer, due to its potent estrogenic activity, and the third strike is that PhIP may then promote the invasiveness of breast cancer cells.The way breast tumors kill is by metastasis­­; it’s got to invade surrounding tissues and organs. The way you test invasiveness is you put cancer cells into what’s called an invasion chamber. Cancer cells go on the top, on one side of a membrane with tiny pores, these little gray circles. This is the underside of the filter, showing no invasion. But, add some estrogen, and you can see a few cancer cells peeking through.Add some PhIP, and they really start going on the move. More breast cancer cell invasion-promoting than straight estrogen. They conclude that “in addition to its well characterised genotoxic potential [DNA-mutation causing potential], PhIP is potently estrogenic…, is capable of powerful hormonal activity…and is able to potently stimulate breast cancer cells to invade through a…membrane model. [This] finding that PhIP is able to exert this pro-invasive [appearance] in breast cancer cells at such low concentrations is remarkable. The genetic [toxicity] of the compound coupled to its ability to enhance cell proliferation and invasion indicates that PhIP can act not only to initiate the carcinogenic process, but also to promote it.” The problem is, they say, that “Exposure to PhIP is difficult to avoid because of its presence in many commonly consumed cooked meats, particularly chicken, beef and fish.”
