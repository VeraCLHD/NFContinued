Now, to significantly extend our lifespan, the latest research suggests one would have to drink seven cups of tea a day, which raises the question: how much is too much? Sometimes you can get too much of a good thing—even water. Last year, for example, a jury awarded $16 million to a family whose mom died of water intoxication trying to win her family a Nintendo. Some radio jocks came up with the idea for a “Hold your Wee for a Wii” contest. Whoever could drink the most water wins. Jennifer came in second—before she keeled over dead. So you can overdo anything. How much tea too much? Is the safe upper limit around 5 cups a day, 10 cups, 15, 20? Or, can one safely drink 25 cups of tea a day? The limiting factor is probably the fluoride levels in tea. There was a case recently reported of a woman developing fluoride toxicity from tea. How much did she drink? One to two gallons of double strength tea every day of her adult life. That’s the equivalent of about 30 to 60 cups of regular tea a day. That’s definitely too much.
