Herbal teas, such as hibiscus tea, may contain antioxidant nutrients (see also here, here, here, and here). Drinking herbal tea may be associated with reduced blood pressure, protection against radiation damage, alleviated stress levels, and anti-inflammatory benefits. Endurance athletes can especially benefit from lemon verbena tea, which unlike antioxidant supplements, does not appear to interfere with the body’s adaptive hermetic response to exercise. Peppermint tea may also improve athletic performance and help nausea and irritable bowel syndromeHerbal tea might also be a better alternative for children who may otherwise be at risk for dental fluorosis by consuming regular tea. However, fruity and sour teas may still cause dental erosions (see also here). This complication can be avoided by using a straw or by rinsing your mouth out with water after drinking.You may want to consider limiting your intake of certain types of tea. For instance, hibiscus tea should not be consumed in excess due to the possible absorption of potentially harmful levels of manganese and aluminum. Yerba maté tea has been found to cause an increase in cell death and may have the capacity to cause cancer, so you may want to avoid it altogether. Men or women with high estrogen levels should be wary of nettle tea due to its high estrogen content. Lastly, pregnant women should be especially careful drinking chamomile tea so as to avoid possibly serious fetal complications.
