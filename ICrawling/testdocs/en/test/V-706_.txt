Measuring urine levels of industrial toxins is more useful than measuring food levels, since it indicates how much of the pollutants are actually absorbed into the body. So, in one sense, it’s telling you what kind of levels are circulating in your body; at the same time, it’s telling you how much your body is successfully getting rid of, through the kidneys. Ideally, we’d like to measure levels in human tissues. Like, how much is actually lodged in one’s breast tissue, for example? Well, women get breast surgery all the time; why not test surgical samples of removed breast tissue? Women get fibroids removed; we can test those, too—fresh autopsy samples. And, hey, what about liposuction? How did the levels of polybromated diphenylethers—flame-retardant chemicals—in the breast tissue of California women compare to various tissue samples taken from women around the world? Where do these flags fit? Which of these bars represents the levels found in Belgian women, Brazilian women, Californian, Czech, French, Hong Kong, Japanese, New Yorkers, Singaporean, or Spanish women? Do we wish they could all be California? No.
