The dramatic rise in obesity has been blamed on overeating and inactivity—but might it be something more? I talked about the “chicken obesity virus.” Scientists are now identifying industrial chemical pollutants released into the environment in the last few decades that can disrupt our metabolism and predispose us to obesity. These pollutants have been called obesogens. The existence of chemical obesogens suggests that the prevailing paradigm, which holds that diet and decreased physical activity alone are the causative triggers for the burgeoning epidemic of obesity, should be reassessed—which is what scientists are doing now. The focus has been on these organotin compounds. Basically they turn preadipocytes—pre-fat cells— into fat cells. How are we exposed? Through our diet. Where are these obesogens found the most? Beans, dairy, fish, fruit, grains, meat, nuts, or veggies? There are actually some in conventionally grown fruits and veggies, because some of these chemicals are used as fungicides, but the #1 dietary source is fish.
