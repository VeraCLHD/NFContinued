Anthocyanins are the red/blue/violet phytonutrients responsible for the vibrant pigmentation of many berries and vegetables.  As powerful antioxidants,  they may play important roles in preventing the development of heart disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, certain cancers, inflammation, glaucoma, diabetes, allergies, COX-inhibitor-induced ulcers, exercise-induced muscle soreness and age-related deterioration of brain and eye tissue.Good sources of anthocyanins include blueberries, cherries, cranberries, blackberries, black currents, purple carrots, purple potatoes, purple cabbage, red grapes, balsamic vinegar and darkly pigmented beans.
