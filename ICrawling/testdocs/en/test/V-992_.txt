What about all the other industrial pollutants, like PCBs?In perhaps the largest study to date, more than 12,000 food and feed samples tested across 18 countries. In the 11,000 food samples tested, the highest mean contamination level was observed in fish and eggs: “fish and fish-derived products followed by eggs, milk and their products, and [then] meat and meat products from [land-based] animals. The lowest contamination was observed in foods of plant origin.”That is reason enough, right there, to transition towards a plant-based diet. Here’s the data. Fish oil, just off the charts: 117 micrograms per kg. Fish meat 35; eggs, with quantifiable levels found in 94% of eggs tested, dairy; beef/pork/chicken; and then, plant foods: 0.08.
