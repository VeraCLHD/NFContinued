Petroleum jelly. Not to eat. People rub it inside their nostrils when their nasal membranes get dry. I know it has the dreaded "p" word in it, but is it harmful, harmless, or helpful? Harmful. A report last year of lipoid pneumonia. And this is not the first case. Not surprising, perhaps, since the jelly liquefies at body temperature. Physicians and patients need to be aware of the hazards, and should try to stop this habit. But it’s not the petroleum itself; it’s the fact that you’re putting any kind of oily substance in your nose, particularly at bedtime—so even the non-petroleum products should not be used this way.
