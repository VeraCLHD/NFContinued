Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.The only nontoxic, noncaloric, or low-calorie sweetener may be erythritol. For a while, it was only available in Japan. But now, it’s pretty much available anywhere.It’s found naturally in pears and grapes. But industrially, we just have yeast make it for us. Doesn’t cause cavities, and hasn’t been implicated in fibromyalgia, preterm birth, headaches, hypertension, brain disorders, platelet disorders.In videos in years past, I’ve talked about erythritol as being harmless. But, new data suggests I may have to change my tune. Now, it actually may be helpful. Adding to its role as a “low-calorie, tooth-friendly, bulk sweetener,” erythritol may be “a sweet antioxidant.”This shows the dose-dependent protective effect of an increasing concentration of erythritol on the oxidative destruction of red blood cells. The reason they even looked for antioxidant activity is because it structurally looks like mannitol, a well-known antioxidant. The problem with mannitol and the other polyols (such as xylitol and sorbitol) is that they aren’t absorbed, and so can cause gastrointestinal symptoms lower down in the colon.“Safety studies suggest that erythritol is well tolerated and shows no signs of toxicity. It is therefore an excellent sugar substitute [for example] for individuals with [diabetes]” because it can both replace sugar and maybe even help reduce free radical formation. Both are expected to reduce the onset and progression of painful and life-threatening diabetic complications.”
