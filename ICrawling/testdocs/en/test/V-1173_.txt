Okay, so we now know how to prevent diabetes; how do we treat it? Well, there are lots of different drugs for diabetics that lower their blood sugars, but often at the expense of increased risk of heart failure, heart attacks, and bone fractures. There has to be a better way.Just like with heart disease, the same diet that prevents the disease in the first place can reverse the disease once you have it. You put 20 diabetics, for example, on even a near-vegetarian diet, and in 16 days, half don’t even need to take insulin any more, and those who do are on half the dose. And that’s after only about two weeks.A randomized, controlled clinical trial put the official American Diabetes Association diabetic diet versus a vegan diet, head-to-head. The ADA diet slowed the progression of disease, such that their diabetes was just a tiny bit worse at the end of the study period. But on the vegan diet, their diabetes actually got better—significantly better. Just think how many lives eating vegan could save—how many lives, eyes, kidneys, feet, and families.To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
