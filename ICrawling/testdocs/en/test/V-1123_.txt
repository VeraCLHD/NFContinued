So, where do we go from here? Here’s what the science says: “Our deeply-rooted beliefs about the wholesomeness of milk and dairy products should be reconsidered (...) We are just beginning to re-assess the biological effects of milk and dairy products as [human] foodstuffs. Human beings are the only species on earth that from the beginning of [infancy] into adulthood are subjected to [this] external hormonal manipulation (...) Milk developed over the course of mammalian evolution…only to be consumed during infancy. The consumption of cow’s milk [in humans] interferes with the sensitive endocrine regulatory network from the fetal period into old age.”While dairy is being re-evaluated as human food, in the very least, “given the tumor promotor effect of IGF-1 [insulin-like growth factor 1, from dairy], patients with tumorous disease should restrict consumption of milk and milk protein.” Unfortunately, we don’t know if we have a tumor until it gets big enough to be picked up. “The same applies to patients with coronary heart disease [the #1 killer in the United States] and [those] with a family history of neurodegenerative disease. [Milk has]…already been identified as an aggravating factor in the acne epidemic…[but] it is even more important that excessive milk consumption can promote diseases commonly associated with a Western lifestyle.”
