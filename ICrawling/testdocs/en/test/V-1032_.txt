Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. Is protein “bad to the bone?” The thought is that dietary protein creates a metabolic acid load that has to be buffered by calcium from the bones. And so, someone who eats a lot of protein—particularly animal protein, which has a higher acid-forming sulphur content—is basically peeing their bones down the toilet. Is this fact, or fiction?
