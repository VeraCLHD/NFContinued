Cruciferous vegetables like collard greens or kale may be especially protective against breast and kidney cancer. One explanation is that they are among the best bile acid-binding vegetables. Green vegetables also contain chlorophyll that may bind and intercept mutagens and thus help serve as our first line of defense. Kale and collard greens contain vision-protecting plant nutrients such as zeaxanthin that may significantly lower the risk of glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. In addition to all these benefits, green (and yellow) vegetables may even help protect against wrinkles!
