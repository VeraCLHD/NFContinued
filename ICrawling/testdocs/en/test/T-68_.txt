The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is not as bold as Benjamin Spock, who wrote in his final edition of Baby and Child Care that the optimal diet for children is a vegan diet.However, we have seen childhood obesity rates exploding over the past few decades, with a particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease in overweight and obese children. So, the AAP does encourage taking advantage of opportunities to educate parents about diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle for both themselves and their kids.Per the clinical practice guidelines, children are eating too much fat and added sugars, and not enough fruits and vegetables. These unhealthy diets can have permanent consequences, with arterial plaques appearing even as early as ten years old. Perhaps this is why the AAP now recommends that all children, starting at age nine, should be screened for high cholesterol, in the hopes of finding and educating families at highest risk.The AAP warns against consumption of cow’s milk (including formula) for children at risk for type 1 diabetes. Early consumption appears to increase risk by about 50%. Per the AAP’s statement in the mid-90s (which they still support), “cow’s milk protein may indeed be an important factor in the initiation of the process that destroys your insulin-producing cells.”Of course, early consumption of cow’s milk is not recommended for any infants, with breast milk the preferred food during the first year of life, and no cow’s milk before that time.Other foods, however, can be introduced earlier. For example, since 2009, the AAP has recommended that we feed children peanuts early in life in order to reduce the long-term development of allergies. Even if a child has siblings with allergies, early consumption of peanuts can reduce the likelihood of the younger child developing allergies.The AAP is also concerned about antibiotic use in animal agriculture, stating that it poses a human health risk. However, the AAP did not go so far as to suggest universal precautions against consuming animals treated with antibiotics.
