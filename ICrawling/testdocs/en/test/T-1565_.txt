Long-term UV radiation exposure may increase cataract risk. Radiation exposure from dental X-rays may be associated with an increased risk of brain tumor.  Radiation from pediatric CAT scans may also raise cancer risk. Most human exposure to polonium, a radioactive element, comes from fish and seafood. The meat industry has used radiation to reduce risk of food-borne illness. Critics of the use of radiation to help sterilize meat suggest the practice allows industry to become more complacent about food safety. Research indicates that ginger and lemon balm may help provide some protection against radiation.  Also, fruit and vegetable intake may decrease radiation-induced chromosome damage. Dr. Dean Ornish was able to use a plant-based diet, without any surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, to reduce prostate cancer progression.
