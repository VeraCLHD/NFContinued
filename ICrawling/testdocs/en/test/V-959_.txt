Commentators on the USDA Dietary Guidelines Committee recommendations note that there is “no discussion at all of the scientific research on the health consequences of eating meat. If the Committee actually discussed this research, it would be unable to justify its recommendation to eat meat, as the research would show that meat increases the risks of chronic diseases, contrary to the purposes of the Guidelines. Thus, by simply ignoring that research, the Committee is able to reach a conclusion that would otherwise look improper.”We know that “[a] plant-based diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and no meat reversed heart disease, completely prevented deaths from heart disease, and slowed the progression of cancer, and an almost identical diet is promoted by the [World Cancer Research Fund] to prevent cancer, as based on the largest review of scientific studies to date.”The best summary of the dietary guidelines that I’ve found comes not from Greece, which I talked about before, not from Harvard, but from a cartoonist, Jimmy Johnson: “The new dietary guidelines have been released. They tell us to eat healthier. But, not so healthy as to noticeably affect any corporate profits. I’m paraphrasing, of course.”
