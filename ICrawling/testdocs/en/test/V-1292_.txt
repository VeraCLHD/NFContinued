So yes, watermelon is a healthy fruit. Healthier than we used to think, but there's healthier still. Greens are the healthiest vegetable. But what are the healthiest fruits? A few years ago, I talked about the studies suggesting that eating a single serving of berries every day could add an extra year to our lifespan. Wait a secondâ€”tastes great and we get to live longer? That's really what plant-based eating is all about.More good news this year on cranberries and blueberries. In general, berries are packed with wonderful phytonutrients, with nice names like petunidin. That's another difference between plant- and animal-based foods. In plant food, there's teanines in tea, gingerols, rosemarinic acid; limonoids, like limonin and tangeritin. Whereas in animal-based foods, there are substances with names like putrescine in turkey muscle; this is from the Journal of Nutrition. Dietary putrescine doesn't really roll off the tongue. Nor would I want it, frankly, to touch my tongue at all.
