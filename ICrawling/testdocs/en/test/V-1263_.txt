So, not all herbal tea is good for us. You’ve heard about white, green, and black tea. What about red tea? Who thinks it’s harmful? Harmless? Helpful? Drink up.Honeybush—another African herbal tea. What do you think? Harmful? Harmless? Helpful? Wonderful stuff. Now, honeybush is not as good as red tea, which is not as good as green. And green tea has more than just antioxidants. It’s got theanine, which we just found out enhances gamma delta T lymphocyte function—which means green tea may not only help decrease our risk of getting cancer, but also perhaps the common cold, as well.Even chamomile, which isn’t even a dark green leafy at all. This little flower was pitted in a battle royale against various human cancer cells. Here’s chamomile slowing down prostate cancer, cervical cancer, fibrosarcoma, colon cancer, and breast cancer cells. As you can see, the more chamomile they added, the more the human cancer growth rates dropped. So, don’t just stop and smell the flowers. Drink them, too.To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
