Vinegar is helpful, according to an examination of the antiglycemic properties of vinegar this year. It blunts the spike in blood sugar that occurs after a meal.

Vinegar reduces postprandial glycemia by about 20% compared to placebo. How? Well, we think it’s because vinegar slows down the speed at which food leaves the stomach—which is good because it can keep us feeling full, longer. How much do we have to take, though? Just two teaspoons with a meal. There are all sorts of wild vinegars out there—pomegranate vinegar, blood orange, black fig. They’re not just calorie-free; they’re good for us.
