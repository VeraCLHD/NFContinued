 To my grandma 
Frances Greger 
 Preface 
It all started with my grandmother. 
I was only a kid when the doctors sent her home in a wheelchair to die. 
Diagnosed with end-stage heart disease, she had already had so many bypass 
operations that the surgeons essentially ran out of plumbing—the scarring from each 
open-heart surgery had made the next more difficult until they finally ran out of 
options. Confined to a wheelchair with crushing chest pain, her doctors told her there 
was nothing else they could do. Her life was over at age sixty-five. 
I think what sparks many kids to want to become doctors when they grow up is 
watching a beloved relative become ill or even die. But for me, it was watching my 
grandma get better. 
Soon after she was discharged from the hospital to spend her last days at home, a 
segment aired on 60 Minutes about Nathan Pritikin, an early lifestyle medicine 
pioneer who had been gaining a reputation for reversing terminal heart disease. He 
had just opened a new center in California, and my grandmother, in desperation, 
somehow made the cross-country trek to become one of its first patients. This was a 
live-in program where everyone was placed on a plant-based diet and then started on 
a graded exercise regimen. They wheeled my grandmother in, and she walked out. 
I’ll never forget that. 
She was even featured in Pritikin’s biography Pritikin: The Man Who Healed 
America’s Heart. My grandma was described as one of the “death’s door people”: 
Frances Greger, from North Miami, Florida, arrived in Santa Barbara at 
one of Pritikin’s early sessions in a wheelchair. Mrs. Greger had heart 
disease, angina, and claudication; her condition was so bad she could no 
longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs. Within three weeks, 
though, she was not only out of her wheelchair but was walking ten miles a 
day.1 
When I was a kid, that was all that mattered: I got to play with Grandma again. 
But over the years, I grew to understand the significance of what had happened. At 
that time, the medical profession didn’t even think it was possible to reverse heart 
disease. Drugs were given to try to slow the progression, and surgery was performed 
to circumvent clogged arteries to try to relieve symptoms, but the disease was 
expected to get worse and worse until you died. Now, however, we know that as 
soon as we stop eating an artery-clogging diet, our bodies can start healing 
themselves, in many cases opening up arteries without drugs or surgery. 
My grandma was given her medical death sentence at age sixty-five. Thanks to a 
healthy diet and lifestyle, she was able to enjoy another thirty-one years on this earth 
with her six grandchildren. The woman who was once told by doctors she only had 
weeks to live didn’t die until she was ninety-six years old. Her near-miraculous 
recovery not only inspired one of those grandkids to pursue a career in medicine but 
granted her enough healthy years to see him graduate from medical school. 
By the time I became a doctor, giants like Dean Ornish, M.D., president and 
founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute, had already proven 
beyond a shadow of a doubt what Pritikin had shown to be true. Using the latest high- 
tech advances—cardiac PET scans,2 quantitative coronary arteriography,3 and 
radionuclide ventriculography4—Dr. Ornish and his colleagues showed that the 
lowest-tech approach—diet and lifestyle—can undeniably reverse heart disease, our 
leading killer. 
Dr. Ornish and his colleagues’ studies were published in some of the most 
prestigious medical journals in the world. Yet medical practice hardly changed. 
Why? Why were doctors still prescribing drugs and using Roto-Rooter-type 
procedures to just treat the symptoms of heart disease and to try to forestall what they 
chose to believe was the inevitable—an early death? 
This was my wake-up call. I opened my eyes to the depressing fact that there are 
other forces at work in medicine besides science. The U.S. health care system runs 
on a fee-for-service model in which doctors get paid for the pills and procedures 
they prescribe, rewarding quantity over quality. We don’t get reimbursed for time 
spent counseling our patients about the benefits of healthy eating. If doctors were 
instead paid for performance, there would be a financial incentive to treat the 
lifestyle causes of disease. Until the model of reimbursement changes, I don’t expect 
great changes in medical care or medical education.5 
Only a quarter of medical schools appear to offer a single dedicated course on 
nutrition.6 During my first interview for medical school, at Cornell University, I 
remember the interviewer emphatically stating, “Nutrition is superfluous to human 
health.” And he was a pediatrician! I knew I was in for a long road ahead. Come to 
think of it, I think the only medical professional who ever asked me about a family 
member’s diet was our veterinarian. 
I was honored to be accepted by nineteen medical schools. I chose Tufts because 
they boasted the most nutrition training—twenty-one hours’ worth, although this was 
still less than 1 percent of the curriculum. 
During my medical training, I was offered countless steak dinners and fancy perks 
by Big Pharma representatives, but not once did I get a call from Big Broccoli. There 
is a reason you hear about the latest drugs on television: Huge corporate budgets 
drive their promotion. The same reason you’ll probably never see a commercial for 
sweet potatoes is the same reason breakthroughs on the power of foods to affect your 
health and longevity may never make it to the public: There’s little profit motive. 
In medical school, even with our paltry twenty-one hours of nutrition training, 
there was no mention of using diet to treat chronic disease, let alone reverse it. I was 
only aware of this body of work because of my family’s personal story. 
The question that haunted me during training was this: If the cure to our number- 
one killer could get lost down the rabbit hole, what else might be buried in the 
medical literature? I made it my life’s mission to find out. 
Most of my years in Boston were spent scouring the dusty stacks in the basement 
of Harvard’s Countway Library of Medicine. I started practicing medicine, but no 
matter how many patients I saw in the clinic every day, even when I was able to 
change the lives of entire families at a time, I knew it was just a drop in the bucket, 
so I went on the road. 
With the help of the American Medical Student Association, my goal was to speak 
at every medical school in the country every two years to influence an entire 
generation of new doctors. I didn’t want another doctor to graduate without this tool 
—the power of food—in her or his toolbox. If my grandma didn’t have to die from 
heart disease, perhaps no one’s grandparent did. 
There were periods where I was giving forty talks a month. I’d roll into town to 
give a breakfast talk at a Rotary Club, give a presentation at the medical school over 
lunch, and then speak to a community group in the evening. I was living out of my car, 
one key on my keychain. I ended up giving more than a thousand presentations around 
the world. 
Not surprisingly, life on the road was not sustainable. I lost a marriage over it. 
With more speaking requests than I could accept, I started putting all my annual 
research findings into a DVD series, Latest in Clinical Nutrition. It’s hard to believe 
I’m almost up to volume 30. Every penny I receive from those DVDs, then and now, 
goes directly to charity, as does the money from my speaking engagements and book 
sales, including the book you’re reading now. 
As corrupting an influence as money is in medicine, it appears to me even worse 
in the field of nutrition, where it seems everyone has his or her own brand of snake- 
oil supplement or wonder gadget. Dogmas are entrenched and data too often cherry- 
picked to support preconceived notions. 
True, I have biases of my own to rein in. Although my original motivation was 
health, over the years, I’ve grown into quite the animal lover. Three cats and a dog 
run our household, and I’ve spent much of my professional life proudly serving the 
Humane Society of the United States as the charity’s public health director. So, like 
many people, I care about the welfare of the animals we eat, but first and foremost, I 
am a physician. My primary duty has always been to care for my patients, to 
accurately provide the best available balance of evidence. 
In the clinic, I could reach hundreds; on the road, thousands. But this life-or-death 
information needed to reach millions. Enter Jesse Rasch, a Canadian philanthropist 
who shared my vision of making evidence-based nutrition freely accessible and 
available to all. The foundation he and his wife, Julie, set up put all my work online 
—thus, NutritionFacts.org was born. I can now reach more people while working 
from home in my pajamas than I ever could when I was traveling the world. 
Now a self-sustaining nonprofit organization itself, NutritionFacts.org has more 
than a thousand bite-sized videos on nearly every conceivable nutrition topic, and I 
post new videos and articles every day. Everything on the website is free for all, for 
all time. There are no ads, no corporate sponsorships. It’s just a labor of love. 
*   *   * 
When I started this work more than a decade ago, I thought the answer was to train 
the trainers, educate the profession. But with the democratization of information, 
doctors no longer hold a monopoly as gatekeepers of knowledge about health. When 
it comes to safe, simple lifestyle prescriptions, I’m realizing it may be more effective 
to empower individuals directly. In a recent national survey of doctor office visits, 
only about one in five smokers were told to quit.7 Just as you don’t have to wait for 
your physician to tell you to stop smoking, you don’t have to wait to start eating 
healthier. Then together we can show my medical colleagues the true power of 
healthy living. 
Today, I live within biking distance of the National Library of Medicine, the 
largest medical library in the world. Last year alone, there were more than twenty- 
four thousand papers published in the medical literature on nutrition, and I now have 
a team of researchers, a wonderful staff, and an army of volunteers who help me dig 
through the mountains of new information. This book is not just another platform 
through which I can share my findings but a long-awaited opportunity to share 
practical advice about how to put this life-changing, life-saving science into practice 
in our daily lives. 
I think my grandma would be proud. 
 Introduction 
PREVENTING, ARRESTING, AND REVERSING OUR LEADING 
KILLERS 
There may be no such thing as dying from old age. From a study of more than forty- 
two thousand consecutive autopsies, centenarians—those who live past one hundred 
—were found to have succumbed to diseases in 100 percent of the cases examined. 
Though most were perceived, even by their physicians, to have been healthy just 
prior to death, not one “died of old age.”1 Until recently, advanced age had been 
considered to be a disease itself,2 but people don’t die as a consequence of maturing. 
They die from disease, most commonly heart attacks.3 
Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we 
eat.4 Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one cause 
of disability.5 Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in medical 
schools, right? 
Sadly, it’s not. According to the most recent national survey, only a quarter of 
medical schools offer a single course in nutrition, down from 37 percent thirty years 
ago.6 While most of the public evidently considers doctors to be “very credible” 
sources of nutrition information,7 six out of seven graduating doctors surveyed felt 
physicians were inadequately trained to counsel patients about their diets.8 One study 
found that people off the street sometimes know more about basic nutrition than their 
doctors, concluding “physicians should be more knowledgeable about nutrition than 
their patients, but these results suggest that this is not necessarily true.”9 
To remedy this situation, a bill was introduced in the California State Legislature 
to mandate physicians get at least twelve hours of nutrition training any time over the 
next four years. It might surprise you to learn that the California Medical Association 
came out strongly opposed to the bill, as did other mainstream medical groups, 
including the California Academy of Family Physicians.10 The bill was amended 
from a mandatory minimum of twelve hours over four years down to seven hours and 
then doctored, one might say, down to zero. 
The California medical board does have one subject requirement: twelve hours 
on pain management and end-of-life care for the terminally ill.11 This disparity 
between prevention and mere mitigation of suffering could be a metaphor for modern 
medicine. A doctor a day may keep the apples away. 
Back in 1903, Thomas Edison predicted that the “doctor of the future will give no 
medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of [the] human frame in diet and in 
the cause and prevention of diseases.”12 Sadly, all it takes is a few minutes watching 
pharmaceutical ads on television imploring viewers to “ask your doctor” about this 
or that drug to know that Edison’s prediction hasn’t come true. A study of thousands 
of patient visits found that the average length of time primary-care doctors spend 
talking about nutrition is about ten seconds.13 
But hey, this is the twenty-first century! Can’t we eat whatever we want and 
simply take meds when we begin having health problems? For too many patients and 
even my physician colleagues, this seems to be the prevailing mind-set. Global 
spending for prescription drugs is surpassing $1 trillion annually, with the United 
States accounting for about one-third of this market.14 Why do we spend so much on 
pills? Many people assume that our manner of death is preprogrammed into our 
genes. High blood pressure by fifty-five, heart attacks at sixty, maybe cancer at 
seventy, and so on.… But for most of the leading causes of death, the science shows 
that our genes often account for only 10–20 percent of risk at most.15 For instance, as 
you’ll see in this book, the rates of killers like heart disease and major cancers differ 
up to a hundredfold among various populations around the globe. But when people 
move from low- to high-risk countries, their disease rates almost always change to 
those of the new environment.16 New diet, new diseases. So, while a sixty-year-old 
American man living in San Francisco has about a 5 percent chance of having a heart 
attack within five years, should he move to Japan and start eating and living like the 
Japanese, his five-year risk would drop to only 1 percent. Japanese Americans in 
their forties can have the same heart attack risk as Japanese in their sixties. Switching 
to an American lifestyle in effect aged their hearts a full twenty years.17 
The Mayo Clinic estimates that nearly 70 percent of Americans take at least one 
prescription drug.18 Yet despite the fact that more people in this country are on 
medication than aren’t, not to mention the steady influx of ever newer and more 
expensive drugs on the market, we aren’t living much longer than others. In terms of 
life expectancy, the United States is down around twenty-seven or twenty-eight out of 
the thirty-four top free-market democracies. People in Slovenia live longer than we 
do.19 And the extra years we are living aren’t necessarily healthy or vibrant. Back in 
2011, a disturbing analysis of mortality and morbidity was published in the Journal 
of Gerontology. Are Americans living longer now compared to about a generation 
ago? Yes, technically. But are those extra years necessarily healthy ones? No. And 
it’s worse than that: We’re actually living fewer healthy years now than we once 
did.20 
Here’s what I mean: A twenty-year-old in 1998 could expect to live about fifty- 
eight more years, while a twenty-year-old in 2006 could look forward to fifty-nine 
more years. However, the twenty-year-old from the 1990s might live ten of those 
years with chronic disease, whereas now it’s more like thirteen years with heart 
disease, cancer, diabetes, or a stroke. So it feels like one step forward, three steps 
back. The researchers also noted that we’re living two fewer functional years—that 
is, for two years, we’re no longer able to perform basic life activities, such as 
walking a quarter of a mile, standing or sitting for two hours without having to lie 
down, or standing without special equipment.21 In other words, we’re living longer, 
but we’re living sicker. 
With these rising disease rates, our children may even die sooner. A special 
report published in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled “A Potential 
Decline in Life Expectancy in the United States in the 21st Century” concluded that 
“the steady rise in life expectancy observed in the modern era may soon come to an 
end and the youth of today may, on average, live less healthy and possibly even 
shorter lives than their parents.”22 
In public health school, students learn that there are three levels of preventive 
medicine. The first is primary prevention, as in trying to prevent people at risk for 
heart disease from suffering their first heart attack. An example of this level of 
preventive medicine would be your doctor prescribing you a statin drug for high 
cholesterol. Secondary prevention takes place when you already have the disease and 
are trying to prevent it from becoming worse, like having a second heart attack. To 
do this, your doctor may add an aspirin or other drugs to your regimen. At the third 
level of preventive medicine, the focus is on helping people manage long-term health 
problems, so your doctor, for example, might prescribe a cardiac rehabilitation 
program that aims to prevent further physical deterioration and pain.23 In 2000, a 
fourth level was proposed. What could this new “quaternary” prevention be? Reduce 
the complications from all the drugs and surgery from the first three levels.24 But 
people seem to forget about a fifth concept, termed primordial prevention, that was 
first introduced by the World Health Organization back in 1978. Decades later, it’s 
finally being embraced by the American Heart Association.25 
Primordial prevention was conceived as a strategy to prevent whole societies 
from experiencing epidemics of chronic-disease risk factors. This means not just 
preventing chronic disease but preventing the risk factors that lead to chronic 
disease.26 For example, instead of trying to prevent someone with high cholesterol 
from suffering a heart attack, why not help prevent him or her from getting high 
cholesterol (which leads to the heart attack) in the first place? 
With this in mind, the American Heart Association came up with “The Simple 7” 
factors that can lead to a healthier life: not smoking, not being overweight, being 
“very active” (defined as the equivalent of walking at least twenty-two minutes a 
day), eating healthier (for example, lots of fruits and vegetables), having below- 
average cholesterol, having normal blood pressure, and having normal blood sugar 
levels.27 The American Heart Association’s goal is to reduce heart-disease deaths by 
20 percent by 2020.28 If more than 90 percent of heart attacks may be avoided with 
lifestyle changes,29 why so modest an aim? Even 25 percent was “deemed 
unrealistic.”30 The AHA’s pessimism may have something to do with the frightening 
reality of the average American diet. 
An analysis of the health behaviors of thirty-five thousand adults across the United 
States was published in the American Heart Association journal. Most of the 
participants didn’t smoke, about half reached their weekly exercise goals, and about 
a third of the population got a pass in each of the other categories—except diet. Their 
diets were scored on a scale from zero to five to see if they met a bare minimum of 
healthy eating behaviors, such as meeting recommended targets for fruit, vegetable, 
and whole-grain consumption or drinking fewer than three cans of soda a week. How 
many even reached four out of five on their Healthy Eating Score? About 1 percent.31 
Maybe if the American Heart Association achieves its goal of an “aggressive”32 20 
percent improvement by 2020, we’ll get up to 1.2 percent. 
*   *   * 
Medical anthropologists have identified several major eras of human disease, 
starting with the Age of Pestilence and Famine, which largely ended with the 
Industrial Revolution, or the stage we’re in now, the Age of Degenerative and Man- 
Made Diseases.33 This shift is reflected in the changing causes of death over the last 
century. In 1900 in the United States, the top-three killers were infectious diseases: 
pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrheal disease.34 Now, the killers are largely 
lifestyle diseases: heart disease, cancer, and chronic lung disease.35 Is this simply 
because antibiotics have enabled us to live long enough to suffer from degenerative 
diseases? No. The emergence of these epidemics of chronic disease was 
accompanied by dramatic shifts in dietary patterns. This is best exemplified by 
what’s been happening to disease rates among people in the developing world over 
the last few decades as they’ve rapidly Westernized their diets. 
In 1990 around the world, most years of healthy life were lost to undernutrition, 
such as diarrheal diseases in malnourished children, but now the greatest disease 
burden is attributed to high blood pressure, a disease of overnutrition.36 The 
pandemic of chronic disease has been ascribed in part to the near-universal shift 
toward a diet dominated by animal-sourced and processed foods—in other words, 
more meat, dairy, eggs, oils, soda, sugar, and refined grains.37 China is perhaps the 
best-studied example. There, a transition away from the country’s traditional, plant- 
based diet was accompanied by a sharp rise in diet-related chronic diseases, such as 
obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.38 
Why do we suspect these changes in diet and disease are related? After all, 
rapidly industrializing societies undergo multitudes of changes. How are scientists 
able to parse out the effects of specific foods? To isolate the effects of different 
dietary components, researchers can follow the diets and diseases of large groups of 
defined individuals over time. Take meat, for example. To see what effect an 
increase in meat consumption might have on disease rates, researchers studied lapsed 
vegetarians. People who once ate vegetarian diets but then started to eat meat at least 
once a week experienced a 146 percent increase in odds of heart disease, a 152 
percent increase in stroke, a 166 percent increase in diabetes, and a 231 percent 
increase in odds for weight gain. During the twelve years after the transition from 
vegetarian to omnivore, meat-eating was associated with a 3.6 year decrease in life 
expectancy.39 
Even vegetarians can suffer high rates of chronic disease, though, if they eat a lot 
of processed foods. Take India, for example. This country’s rates of diabetes, heart 
disease, obesity, and stroke have increased far faster than might have been expected 
given its relatively small increase in per capita meat consumption. This has been 
blamed on the decreasing “whole plant food content of their diet,” including a shift 
from brown rice to white and the substitution of other refined carbohydrates, 
packaged snacks, and fast-food products for India’s traditional staples of lentils, 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.40 In general, the dividing line 
between health-promoting and disease-promoting foods may be less plant- versus 
animal-sourced foods and more whole plant foods versus most everything else. 
To this end, a dietary quality index was developed that simply reflects the 
percentage of calories people derive from nutrient-rich, unprocessed plant foods41 on 
a scale of zero to one hundred. The higher people score, the more body fat they may 
lose over time42 and the lower their risk may be of abdominal obesity,43 high blood 
pressure,44 high cholesterol, and high triglycerides.45 Comparing the diets of 100 
women with breast cancer to 175 healthy women, researchers concluded that scoring 
higher on the whole plant food diet index (greater than about thirty compared to less 
than about eighteen) may reduce the odds of breast cancer more than 90 percent.46 
Sadly, most Americans hardly make it past a score of ten. The standard American 
diet rates eleven out of one hundred. According to estimates from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, 32 percent of our calories comes from animal foods, 57 
percent comes from processed plant foods, and only 11 percent comes from whole 
grains, beans, fruits, vegetables, and nuts.47 That means on a scale of one to ten, the 
American diet would rate about a one. 
We eat almost as if the future doesn’t matter. And, indeed, there are actually data 
to back that up. A study entitled “Death Row Nutrition: Curious Conclusions of Last 
Meals” analyzed the last meal requests of hundreds of individuals executed in the 
United States during a five-year period. It turns out that the nutritional content didn’t 
differ much from what Americans normally eat.48 If we continue to eat as though 
we’re having our last meals, eventually they will be. 
What percentage of Americans hit all the American Heart Association’s “Simple 
7” recommendations? Of 1,933 men and women surveyed, most met two or three, but 
hardly any managed to meet all seven simple health components. In fact, just a single 
individual could boast hitting all seven recommendations.49 One person out of nearly 
two thousand. As a recent past president of the American Heart Association 
responded, “That should give all of us pause.”50 
The truth is that adhering to just four simple healthy lifestyle factors can have a 
strong impact on the prevention of chronic diseases: not smoking, not being obese, 
getting a half hour of exercise a day, and eating healthier—defined as consuming 
more fruits, veggies, and whole grains and less meat. Those four factors alone were 
found to account for 78 percent of chronic disease risk. If you start from scratch and 
manage to tick off all four, you may be able to wipe out more than 90 percent of your 
risk of developing diabetes, more than 80 percent of your risk of having a heart 
attack, cut by half your risk of having a stroke, and reduce your overall cancer risk by 
more than one-third.51 For some cancers, like our number-two cancer killer, colon 
cancer, up to 71 percent of cases appear to be preventable through a similar portfolio 
of simple diet and lifestyle changes.52 
Maybe it’s time we stop blaming genetics and focus on the more than 70 percent 
that is directly under our control.53 We have the power. 
*   *   * 
Does all this healthy living translate into a longer life as well? The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) followed approximately eight thousand 
Americans aged twenty years or older for about six years. They found that three 
cardinal lifestyle behaviors exerted an enormous impact on mortality: People can 
substantially reduce their risk for early death by not smoking, consuming a healthier 
diet, and engaging in sufficient physical activity. And the CDC’s definitions were 
pretty laid-back: By not smoking, the CDC just meant not currently smoking. A 
“healthy diet” was defined merely as being in the top 40 percent in terms of 
complying with the wimpy federal dietary guidelines, and “physically active” meant 
averaging about twenty-one minutes or more a day of at least moderate exercise. 
People who managed at least one of the three had a 40 percent lower risk of dying 
within that six-year period. Those who hit two out of three cut their chances of dying 
by more than half, and those who scored all three behaviors reduced their chances of 
dying in that time by 82 percent.54 
Of course, people sometimes fib about how well they eat. How accurate can these 
findings really be if they’re based on people’s self-reporting? A similar study on 
health behaviors and survival didn’t just take people’s own word for how healthy 
they were eating; the researchers measured how much vitamin C participants had in 
their bloodstreams. The level of vitamin C in the blood was considered a “good 
biomarker of plant food intake” and hence was used as a proxy for a healthy diet. The 
conclusions held up. The drop in mortality risk among those with healthier habits was 
equivalent to being fourteen years younger.55 It’s like turning back the clock fourteen 
years—not with a drug or a DeLorean but just by eating and living healthier. 
Let’s talk a little more about aging. In each of your cells, you have forty-six 
strands of DNA coiled into chromosomes. At the tip of each chromosome, there’s a 
tiny cap called a telomere, which keeps your DNA from unraveling and fraying. 
Think of it as the plastic tips on the end of your shoelaces. Every time your cells 
divide, however, a bit of that cap is lost. And when the telomere is completely gone, 
your cells can die.56 Though this is an oversimplification,57 telomeres have been 
thought of as your life “fuse”: They can start shortening as soon as you’re born, and 
when they’re gone, you’re gone. In fact, forensic scientists can take DNA from a 
bloodstain and roughly estimate how old the person was based on how long their 
telomeres are.58 
Sounds like fodder for a great scene in CSI, but is there anything you can do to 
slow the rate at which your fuses burn? The thought is that if you can slow down this 
ticking cellular clock, you may be able to slow down the aging process and live 
longer.59 So what would you have to do if you wanted to prevent this telomere cap 
from burning away? Well, smoking cigarettes is associated with triple the rate of 
telomere loss,60 so the first step is simple: Stop smoking. But the food you eat every 
day may also have an impact on how fast you lose your telomeres. The consumption 
of fruits,61 vegetables,62 and other antioxidant-rich foods63 has been associated with 
longer protective telomeres. In contrast, the consumption of refined grains,64 soda,65 
meat (including fish),66 and dairy67 has been linked to shortened telomeres. What if 
you ate a diet composed of whole plant foods and stayed away from processed foods 
and animal foods? Could cellular aging be slowed? 
The answer lies in an enzyme found in Methuselah. That’s the name given to a 
bristlecone pine tree growing in the White Mountains of California, which, at the 
time, happened to be the oldest recorded living being and is now nearing its 4,800th 
birthday. It was already hundreds of years old before construction of the pyramids in 
Egypt began. There’s an enzyme in the roots of bristlecone pines that appears to peak 
a few thousand years into their life span, and it actually rebuilds telomeres.68 
Scientists named it telomerase. Once they knew what to look for, researchers 
discovered the enzyme was present in human cells too. The question then became, 
how can we boost the activity of this age-defying enzyme? 
Seeking answers, the pioneering researcher Dr. Dean Ornish teamed up with Dr. 
Elizabeth Blackburn, who was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Medicine for her 
discovery of telomerase. In a study funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense, 
they found that three months of whole-food, plant-based nutrition and other healthy 
changes could significantly boost telomerase activity, the only intervention ever 
shown to do so.69 The study was published in one of the most prestigious medical 
journals in the world. The accompanying editorial concluded that this landmark study 
“should encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle in order to avoid or combat 
cancer and age-related diseases.”70 
So were Dr. Ornish and Dr. Blackburn able to successfully slow down aging with 
a healthy diet and lifestyle? A five-year follow-up study was recently published in 
which the lengths of the study subjects’ telomeres were measured. In the control 
group (the group of participants who did not change their lifestyles), their telomeres 
predictably shrank with age. But for the healthy-living group, not only did their 
telomeres shrink less, they grew. Five years later, their telomeres were even longer 
on average than when they started, suggesting a healthy lifestyle can boost telomerase 
enzyme activity and reverse cellular aging.71 
Subsequent research has shown that the telomere lengthening wasn’t just because 
the healthy-living group was exercising more or losing weight. Weight loss through 
calorie restriction and an even more vigorous exercise program failed to improve 
telomere length, so it appears that the active ingredient is the quality, not quantity, of 
the food eaten. As long as people were eating the same diet, it didn’t appear to matter 
how small their portions were, how much weight they lost, or even how hard they 
exercised; after a year, they saw no benefit.72 In contrast, individuals on the plant- 
based diet exercised only half as much, enjoyed the same amount of weight loss after 
just three months,73 and achieved significant telomere protection.74 In other words, it 
wasn’t the weight loss and it wasn’t the exercise that reversed cell aging—it was the 
food. 
Some people have expressed concern that boosting telomerase activity could 
theoretically increase cancer risk, since tumors have been known to hijack the 
telomerase enzyme and use it to ensure their own immortality.75 But as we’ll see in 
chapter 13, Dr. Ornish and his colleagues have used the same diet and lifestyle 
changes to halt and apparently reverse the progression of cancer in certain 
circumstances. We will also see how the same diet can reverse heart disease too. 
What about our other leading killers? It turns out a more plant-based diet may help 
prevent, treat, or reverse every single one of our fifteen leading causes of death. In 
this book, I’ll go through this list, with a chapter on each: 
MORTALITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
Annual Deaths 
  1. Coronary heart disease76 375,000 
  2. Lung diseases (lung cancer,77 COPD, and asthma78) 296,000 
  3. You’ll be surprised! (see chapter 15) 225,000 
  4. Brain diseases (stroke79 and Alzheimer’s80) 214,000 
  5. Digestive cancers (colorectal, pancreatic, and esophageal)81 106,000 
  6. Infections (respiratory and blood)82 95,000 
  7. Diabetes83 76,000 
  8. High blood pressure84 65,000 
  9. Liver disease (cirrhosis and cancer)85 60,000 
10. Blood cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma)86 56,000 
11. Kidney disease87 47,000 
12. Breast cancer88 41,000 
13. Suicide89 41,000 
14. Prostate cancer90 28,000 
15. Parkinson’s disease91 25,000 
Certainly there are prescription medications that can help with some of these 
conditions. For example, you can take statin drugs for your cholesterol to lower risk 
of heart attacks, pop different pills and inject insulin for diabetes, and take a slew of 
diuretics and other blood pressure medications for hypertension. But there is only 
one unifying diet that may help prevent, arrest, or even reverse each of these killers. 
Unlike with medications, there isn’t one kind of diet for optimal liver function and a 
different diet to improve our kidneys. A heart-healthy diet is a brain-healthy diet is a 
lung-healthy diet. The same diet that helps prevent cancer just so happens to be the 
same diet that may help prevent type 2 diabetes and every other cause of death on the 
top-fifteen list. Unlike drugs—which only target specific functions, can have 
dangerous side effects, and may only treat the symptoms of disease—a healthy diet 
can benefit all organ systems at once, has good side effects, and may treat the 
underlying cause of illness. 
That one unifying diet found to best prevent and treat many of these chronic 
diseases is a whole-food, plant-based diet, defined as an eating pattern that 
encourages the consumption of unrefined plant foods and discourages meats, dairy 
products, eggs, and processed foods.92 In this book, I don’t advocate for a vegetarian 
diet or a vegan diet. I advocate for an evidence-based diet, and the best available 
balance of science suggests that the more whole plant foods we eat, the better—both 
to reap their nutritional benefits and to displace less healthful options. 
Most doctor visits are for lifestyle-based diseases, which means they’re 
preventable diseases.93 As physicians, my colleagues and I were trained not to treat 
the root cause but rather the consequences by giving a lifetime’s worth of 
medications to treat risk factors like high blood pressure, blood sugar, and 
cholesterol. This approach has been compared to mopping up the floor around an 
overflowing sink instead of simply turning off the faucet.94 Drug companies are more 
than happy to sell you a new roll of paper towels every day for the rest of your life 
while the water continues to gush. As Dr. Walter Willett, the chair of nutrition at 
Harvard University’s School of Public Health, put it: “The inherent problem is that 
most pharmacologic strategies do not address the underlying causes of ill health in 
Western countries, which are not drug deficiencies.”95 
Treating the cause is not only safer and cheaper but it can work better. So why 
don’t more of my medical colleagues do it? Not only were they not trained how, 
doctors don’t get paid for it. No one profits from lifestyle medicine (other than the 
patient!), so it’s not a major part of medical training or practice.96 That’s just how the 
current system works. The medical system is set up to financially reward prescribing 
pills and procedures, not produce. After Dr. Ornish proved that heart disease could 
be reversed without drugs or surgery, he thought that his studies would have a 
meaningful effect on the practice of mainstream medicine. After all, he effectively 
found a cure for our number-one killer! But he was mistaken—not about his critically 
important findings regarding diet and disease reversal but about how much influence 
the business of medicine has on the practice of medicine. In his words, Dr. Ornish 
“realized reimbursement is a much more powerful determinant of medical practice 
than research.”97 
Though there are vested interests, such as the processed food and pharmaceutical 
industries, which fight hard to maintain the status quo, there is one corporate sector 
that actually benefits from keeping people healthy—namely, the insurance industry. 
Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed-care organization in the country, published a 
nutritional update for physicians in their official medical journal, informing their 
nearly fifteen thousand physicians that healthy eating may be “best achieved with a 
plant-based diet, which we define as a regimen that encourages whole, plant-based 
foods and discourages meats, dairy products, and eggs as well as all refined and 
processed foods.”98 
“Too often, physicians ignore the potential benefits of good nutrition and quickly 
prescribe medications instead of giving patients a chance to correct their disease 
through healthy eating and active living.… Physicians should consider recommending 
a plant-based diet to all their patients, especially those with high blood pressure, 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or obesity.”99 Physicians should give their patients 
a chance to first correct their disease themselves with plant-based nutrition. 
The major downside Kaiser Permanente’s nutritional update describes is that this 
diet may work a little too well. If people begin eating plant-based diets while still 
taking medications, their blood pressure or blood sugar could actually drop so low 
that physicians may need to adjust medications or eliminate them altogether. 
Ironically, the “side effect” of the diet may be not having to take drugs anymore. The 
article ends with a familiar refrain: Further research is needed. In this case, though, 
“Further research is needed to find ways to make plant-based diets the new normal. 
…”100

We’re a long way off from Thomas Edison’s 1903 prediction, but it is my hope that 
this book can help you understand that most of our leading causes of death and 
disability are more preventable than inevitable. The primary reason diseases tend to 
run in families may be that diets tend to run in families. 
For most of our leading killers, nongenetic factors like diet can account for at 
least 80 or 90 percent of cases. As I noted before, this is based on the fact that the 
rates of cardiovascular disease and major cancers differ fivefold to a hundredfold 
around the world. Migration studies show this is not just genetics. When people 
move from low- to high-risk areas, their disease risk nearly always shoots up to 
match the new setting.101 As well, dramatic changes in disease rates within a single 
generation highlight the primacy of external factors. Colon cancer mortality in Japan 
in the 1950s was less than one-fifth that of the United States (including Americans of 
Japanese ancestry).102 But now colon cancer rates in Japan are as bad as they are in 
the United States, a rise that has been attributed in part to the fivefold increase in 
meat consumption.103 
Research has shown us that identical twins separated at birth will get different 
diseases based on how they live their lives. A recent American Heart Association– 
funded study compared the lifestyles and arteries of nearly five hundred twins. It 
found that diet and lifestyle factors clearly trumped genes.104 You share 50 percent of 
your genes with each of your parents, so if one parent dies of a heart attack, you know 
you’ve inherited some of that susceptibility. But even among identical twins who 
have the exact same genes, one could die early of a heart attack and the other could 
live a long, healthy life with clean arteries depending on what she ate and how she 
lived. Even if both your parents died with heart disease, you should be able to eat 
your way to a healthy heart. Your family history does not have to become your 
personal destiny. 
Just because you’re born with bad genes doesn’t mean you can’t effectively turn 
them off. As you’ll see in the breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease chapters, even if 
you’re born with high-risk genes, you have tremendous control over your medical 
destiny. Epigenetics is the hot new field of study that deals with this control of gene 
activity. Skin cells look and function a lot differently from bone cells, brain cells, or 
heart cells, but each of our cells has the same complement of DNA. What makes them 
act differently is that they each have different genes turned on or off. That’s the power 
of epigenetics. Same DNA, but different results. 
Let me give you an example of how striking this effect can be. Consider the 
humble honeybee. Queen bees and worker bees are genetically identical, yet queen 
bees lay up to two thousand eggs a day, while worker bees are functionally sterile. 
Queens live up to three years; workers may live only three weeks.105 The difference 
between the two is diet. When the hive’s queen is dying, a larva is picked by nurse 
bees to be fed a secreted substance called royal jelly. When the larva eats this jelly, 
the enzyme that had been silencing the expression of royal genes is turned off, and a 
new queen is born.106 The queen has the exact same genes as any of the workers, but 
because of what she ate, different genes are expressed, and her life and life span are 
dramatically altered as a result. 
Cancer cells can use epigenetics against us by silencing tumor-suppressor genes 
that could otherwise stop the cancer in its tracks. So even if you’re born with good 
genes, cancer can sometimes find a way to turn them off. A number of chemotherapy 
drugs have been developed to restore our bodies’ natural defenses, but their use has 
been limited due to their high toxicity.107 There are, however, a number of 
compounds distributed widely throughout the plant kingdom—including beans, 
greens, and berries—that appear to have the same effect naturally.108 For example, 
dripping green tea on colon, esophageal, or prostate cancer cells has been shown to 
reactivate genes silenced by the cancer.109 This hasn’t just been demonstrated in a 
petri dish, though. Three hours after eating a cup of broccoli sprouts, the enzyme that 
cancers use to help silence our defenses is suppressed in your bloodstream110 to an 
extent equal to or greater than the chemotherapy agent specifically designed for that 
purpose,111 without the toxic side effects.112 
What if we ate a diet chock-full of plant foods? In the Gene Expression 
Modulation by Intervention with Nutrition and Lifestyle (GEMINAL) study, Dr. 
Ornish and colleagues took biopsies from men with prostate cancer before and after 
three months of intensive lifestyle changes that included a whole-food, plant-based 
diet. Without any chemotherapy or radiation, beneficial changes in gene expression 
for five hundred different genes were noted. Within just a few months, the expression 
of disease-preventing genes was boosted, and oncogenes that promote breast and 
prostate cancer were suppressed.113 Whatever genes we may have inherited from our 
parents, what we eat can affect how those genes affect our health. The power is 
mainly in our hands and on our plates.

This book is divided into two parts: the “why” and the “how.” In part 1—the “why” 
to eat healthfully section—I will explore the role diet can play in the prevention, 
treatment, and reversal of the fifteen leading causes of death in the United States. I’ll 
then take a closer look at more practical aspects of healthy eating in the “how” to eat 
healthfully section presented in part 2. For example, we’ll see in part 1 why beans 
and greens are among the healthiest foods on earth. Then, in part 2, we’ll take a look 
at how best to eat them—we’ll explore such issues as how many greens to eat every 
day and whether they’re best cooked, canned, fresh, or frozen. We’ll see in part 1 
why it’s important to eat at least nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily, and then 
part 2 will help you decide whether to buy organic or conventional produce. I’ll try 
to answer all the common questions I receive daily and then offer real-world tips for 
grocery shopping and meal planning to make it as easy as possible to best feed 
yourself and your family.

Besides writing more books, I intend to keep lecturing at medical schools and 
speaking at hospitals and conferences for as long as I can. I’m going to keep trying to 
ignite the spark that led my colleagues into the healing profession in the first place: to 
help people get better. There are tools missing from too many doctors’ medical 
toolboxes, powerful interventions that can make many of our patients well again 
instead of merely slowing their decline. I’ll keep working on trying to change the 
system, but you, the reader, don’t have to wait. You can start now by following the 
recommendations within the following chapters. Eating healthier is easier than you 
think, it’s inexpensive, and it might just save your life. 
 PART 1 
 CHAPTER 1 
How Not to Die from Heart Disease 
Imagine if terrorists created a bioagent that spread mercilessly, claiming the lives of 
nearly four hundred thousand Americans every year. That is the equivalent of one 
person every eighty-three seconds, every hour, around the clock, year after year. The 
pandemic would be front-page news all day, every day. We’d marshal the army and 
march our finest medical minds into a room to figure out a cure for this bioterror 
plague. In short, we’d stop at nothing until the terrorists were stopped. 
Fortunately, we’re not actually losing hundreds of thousands of people each year 
to a preventable threat … are we? 
Actually, we are. This particular biological weapon may not be a germ released 
by terrorists, but it kills more Americans annually than have all our past wars 
combined. It can be stopped not in a laboratory but right in our grocery stores, 
kitchens, and dining rooms. As far as weapons go, we don’t need vaccines or 
antibiotics. A simple fork will do. 
So what’s going on here? If this epidemic is present on such a massive scale, yet 
so preventable, why aren’t we doing more about it? 
The killer I’m talking about is coronary heart disease, and it’s affecting nearly 
everyone raised on the standard American diet. 
Our Top Killer 
America’s number-one killer is a different kind of terrorist: fatty deposits in the 
walls of your arteries called atherosclerotic plaque. For most Americans raised on a 
conventional diet, plaque accumulates inside the coronary arteries—the blood 
vessels that crown the heart (hence “coronary”) and supply it with oxygen-rich 
blood. This buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis, from the Greek words 
athere (gruel) and sklerosis (hardening), is the hardening of the arteries by pockets 
of cholesterol-rich gunk that builds up within the inner linings of the blood vessels. 
This process occurs over decades, slowly bulging into the space inside the arteries, 
narrowing the path for blood to flow. The restriction of blood circulation to the heart 
muscle can lead to chest pain and pressure, known as angina, when people try to 
exert themselves. If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form within the artery. This 
sudden blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack, damaging or even killing 
part of the heart. 
When you think about heart disease, you may think of friends or loved ones who 
suffered for years with chest pain and shortness of breath before they finally 
succumbed. However, for the majority of Americans who die suddenly from heart 
disease, the very first symptom may be their last.1 It’s called “sudden cardiac death.” 
This is when death occurs within an hour of symptom onset. In other words, you may 
not even realize you’re at risk until it’s too late. You could be feeling perfectly fine 
one moment, and then an hour later, you’re gone forever. That’s why it’s critical to 
prevent heart disease in the first place, before you even necessarily know you have it. 
My patients often asked me, “Isn’t heart disease just a consequence of getting 
old?” I can see why this is a common misconception. After all, your heart pumps 
literally billions of times during the average life span. Does your ticker just conk out 
after a while? No. 
A large body of evidence shows there were once enormous swaths of the world 
where the epidemic of coronary heart disease simply didn’t exist. For instance, in the 
famous China-Cornell-Oxford Project (known as the China Study), researchers 
investigated the eating habits and incidence of chronic disease among hundreds of 
thousands of rural Chinese. In Guizhou province, for example, a region comprising 
half a million people, over the course of three years, not a single death could be 
attributed to coronary artery disease among men under sixty-five.2 
During the 1930s and 1940s, Western-trained doctors working throughout an 
extensive network of missionary hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa noticed that many of 
the chronic diseases laying waste to populations in the so-called developed world 
were largely absent across most of the continent. In Uganda, a country of millions in 
eastern Africa, coronary heart disease was described as “almost non-existent.”3 
But were the people of these nations simply dying early of other diseases, never 
living long enough to come down with heart disease? No. The doctors compared 
autopsies of Ugandans to autopsies of Americans who had died at the same age. The 
researchers found that out of 632 people autopsied in Saint Louis, Missouri, there 
had been 136 heart attacks. But in 632 age-matched Ugandans? A single heart attack. 
The Ugandans experienced more than one hundred times fewer heart attacks than the 
Americans. The doctors were so blown away that they examined another 800 deaths 
in Uganda. Out of more than 1,400 Ugandans autopsied, researchers found just one 
body with a small, healed lesion of the heart, meaning the attack wasn’t even fatal. 
Then and now, in the industrialized world, heart disease is a leading killer. In central 
Africa, heart disease was so rare it killed fewer than one in a thousand.4 
Immigration studies show that this resistance to heart disease is not just something 
in the Africans’ genes. When people move from low-risk to high-risk areas, their 
disease rates skyrocket as they adopt the diet and lifestyle habits of their new homes.5 
The extraordinarily low rates of heart disease in rural China and Africa have been 
attributed to the extraordinarily low cholesterol levels among these populations. 
Though Chinese and African diets are very different, they share commonalities: They 
are both centered on plant-derived foods, such as grains and vegetables. By eating so 
much fiber and so little animal fat, their total cholesterol levels averaged under 150 
mg/dL,6,7 similar to people who eat contemporary plant-based diets.8 
So what does all of this mean? It means heart disease may be a choice. 
If you looked at the teeth of people who lived more than ten thousand years before 
the invention of the toothbrush, you’d notice they had almost no cavities.9 They never 
flossed a day in their lives, yet no cavities. That’s because candy bars hadn’t been 
invented yet. The reason people get cavities now is that the pleasure they derive from 
sugary treats may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist’s chair. I certainly 
enjoy the occasional indulgence—I’ve got a good dental plan! But what if instead of 
the dental plaque on our teeth, we’re talking about the atherosclerotic plaque building 
up in our arteries? We’re not just talking about scraping tartar anymore. We’re 
talking about life and death. 
Heart disease is the number-one reason we and most of our loved ones will die. 
Of course, it’s up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how 
to live, but shouldn’t we try to make these choices consciously by educating 
ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions? Just as we could avoid 
sugary foods that rot our teeth, we can avoid the trans fat, saturated fat, and 
cholesterol-laden foods that clog up our arteries. 
Let’s take a look at the progression of coronary heart disease throughout life and 
learn how simple dietary choices at any stage may prevent, stop, and even reverse 
heart disease before it’s too late. 
Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil? 
Thanks in part to the American Heart Association’s recommendation that individuals 
at high risk for heart disease should ask their physicians about omega-3 fish oil 
supplementation,10 fish oil pills have grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. We 
now consume more than one hundred thousand tons of fish oil every year.11 
But what does the science say? Are the purported benefits of fish oil 
supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a fish tale? A 
systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association looked at all the best randomized clinical trials evaluating the 
effects of omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and 
stroke. These included studies not only on fish oil supplements but also studies on the 
effects of advising people to eat more oily fish. What did they find? Overall, the 
researchers found no protective benefit for overall mortality, heart disease mortality, 
sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke.12 
What about for someone who had already had a heart attack and is trying to 
prevent another? Still no benefit was found.13 
Where did we even get this idea that the omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil 
supplements are good for you? There was a notion that Eskimos were protected from 
heart disease, but that appears to be a complete myth.14 Some early studies, however, 
looked promising. For example, the famous DART trial from the 1980s involving 
two thousand men found that those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29 percent reduction 
in mortality.15 That’s impressive, so it’s no wonder the study got a lot of attention. 
But people seem to have forgotten about the sequel, the DART-2 trial, which found 
the exact opposite. Run by the same group of researchers, the DART-2 trial was an 
even bigger study—three thousand men—but this time, participants advised to eat 
oily fish and particularly those who were supplied with fish oil capsules had a 
higher risk of cardiac death.16,17 
After putting all the studies together, researchers concluded that there was no 
longer justification for the use of omega-3s in everyday clinical practice.18 What 
should doctors do when their patients follow the American Heart Association’s 
advice and inquire about fish oil supplements? As the director of Lipids and 
Metabolism at Mount Sinai’s cardiovascular institute put it: “Given this and other 
negative meta-analyses, our job [as doctors] should be to stop highly marketed fish 
oil supplementation to all our patients…”19 
Heart Disease Starts in Childhood 
In 1953, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association 
radically changed our understanding of the development of heart disease. 
Researchers conducted a series of three hundred autopsies on American casualties of 
the Korean War, with an average age of around twenty-two. Shockingly, 77 percent 
of soldiers already had visible evidence of coronary atherosclerosis. Some even had 
arteries that were blocked off 90 percent or more.20 The study “dramatically showed 
that atherosclerotic changes appear in the coronary arteries years and decades before 
the age at which coronary heart disease (CHD) becomes a clinically recognized 
problem.”21 
Later studies of accidental death victims between the ages of three and twenty-six 
found that fatty streaks—the first stage of atherosclerosis—were found in nearly all 
American children by age ten.22 By the time we reach our twenties and thirties, these 
fatty streaks can turn into full-blown plaques like those seen in the young American 
GIs of the Korean War. And by the time we’re forty or fifty, they can start killing us 
off. 
If there’s anyone reading this over the age of ten, the question isn’t whether or not 
you want to eat healthier to prevent heart disease but whether or not you want to 
reverse the heart disease you very likely already have. 
Just how early do these fatty streaks start to appear? Atherosclerosis may start 
even before birth. Italian researchers looked inside arteries taken from miscarriages 
and premature newborns who died shortly after birth. It turns out that the arteries of 
fetuses whose mothers had high LDL cholesterol levels were more likely to contain 
arterial lesions.23 This finding suggests that atherosclerosis may not just start as a 
nutritional disease of childhood but one during pregnancy. 
It’s become commonplace for pregnant women to avoid smoking and drinking 
alcohol. It’s also never too early to start eating healthier for the next generation. 
According to William C. Roberts, the editor in chief of the American Journal of 
Cardiology, the only critical risk factor for atherosclerotic plaque buildup is 
cholesterol, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol in your blood.24 Indeed, LDL is 
called “bad” cholesterol, because it’s the vehicle by which cholesterol is deposited 
into your arteries. Autopsies of thousands of young accident victims have shown that 
the level of cholesterol in the blood was closely correlated with the amount of 
atherosclerosis in their arteries.25 To drastically reduce LDL cholesterol levels, you 
need to drastically reduce your intake of three things: trans fat, which comes from 
processed foods and naturally from meat and dairy; saturated fat, found mainly in 
animal products and junk foods; and to a lesser extent dietary cholesterol, found 
exclusively in animal-derived foods, especially eggs.26 
Notice a pattern here? The three boosters of bad cholesterol—the number-one 
risk factor for our number-one killer—all stem from eating animal products and 
processed junk. This likely explains why populations living on traditional diets 
revolving around whole plant foods have largely remained free from the epidemic of 
heart disease. 
It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid! 
Dr. Roberts hasn’t only been editor in chief of the American Journal of Cardiology 
for more than thirty years; he’s the executive director of the Baylor Heart and 
Vascular Institute and has authored more than a thousand scientific publications and 
written more than a dozen textbooks on cardiology. He knows his stuff. 
In his editorial “It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid!,” Dr. Roberts argued (as noted 
earlier) that there is only one true risk factor for coronary heart disease: 
cholesterol.27 You could be an obese, diabetic, smoking couch potato and still not 
develop atherosclerosis, he argues, as long as the cholesterol level in your blood is 
low enough. 
The optimal LDL cholesterol level is probably 50 or 70 mg/dL, and apparently, 
the lower, the better. That’s where you start out at birth, that’s the level seen in 
populations largely free of heart disease, and that’s the level at which the progression 
of atherosclerosis appears to stop in cholesterol-lowering trials.28 An LDL around 
70 mg/dL corresponds to a total cholesterol reading of about 150, the level below 
which no deaths from coronary heart disease were reported in the famous 
Framingham Heart Study, a generations-long project to identify risk factors for heart 
disease.29 The population target should therefore be a total cholesterol level under 
150 mg/dL. “If such a goal was created,” Dr. Roberts wrote, “the great scourge of the 
Western world would be essentially eliminated.”30 
The average cholesterol for people living in the United States is much higher than 
150 mg/dL; it hovers around 200 mg/dL. If your blood test results came back with a 
total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, your physician might reassure you that your 
cholesterol is normal. But in a society where it’s normal to die of heart disease, 
having a “normal” cholesterol level is probably not a good thing. 
To become virtually heart-attack proof, you need to get your LDL cholesterol at 
least under 70 mg/dL. Dr. Roberts noted that there are only two ways to achieve this 
for our population: to put more than a hundred million Americans on a lifetime of 
medications or to recommend they all eat a diet centered around whole plant foods.31 
So: drugs or diet. All health plans cover cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, so 
why change your diet if you can simply pop a pill every day for the rest of your life? 
Unfortunately, as we’ll see in chapter 15, these drugs don’t work nearly as well as 
people think, and they may cause undesirable side effects to boot. 
Want Fries with That Lipitor? 
The cholesterol-lowering statin drug Lipitor has become the best-selling drug of all 
time, generating more than $140 billion in global sales.32 This class of drugs 
garnered so much enthusiasm in the medical community that some U.S. health 
authorities reportedly advocated they be added to the public water supply like 
fluoride is.33 One cardiology journal even offered the tongue-in-cheek suggestion for 
fast-food restaurants to offer “McStatin” condiments along with ketchup packets to 
help neutralize the effects of unhealthy dietary choices.34 
For those at high risk for heart disease who are unwilling or unable to bring down 
their cholesterol levels naturally with dietary changes, the benefits of statins 
generally outweigh the risks. These drugs do have side effects, though, such as the 
potential for liver or muscle damage. The reason some doctors routinely order 
regular blood tests for patients on these drugs is to monitor for liver toxicity. We can 
also test the blood for the presence of muscle breakdown products, but biopsies 
reveal that people on statins can show evidence of muscle damage even if their blood 
work is normal and they exhibit no symptoms of muscle soreness or weakness.35 The 
decline in muscular strength and performance sometimes associated with these drugs 
may not be such a big deal for younger individuals, but they can place our seniors at 
increased risk for falls and injury.36 
More recently, other concerns have been raised. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration announced newly mandated safety labeling on statin drugs to warn 
doctors and patients about their potential for brain-related side effects, such as 
memory loss and confusion. Statin drugs also appeared to increase the risk of 
developing diabetes.37 In 2013, a study of several thousand breast cancer patients 
reported that long-term use of statins may as much as double a woman’s risk of 
invasive breast cancer.38 The primary killer of women is heart disease, not cancer, 
so the benefits of statins may still outweigh the risks, but why accept any risk at all if 
you can lower your cholesterol naturally? 
Plant-based diets have been shown to lower cholesterol just as effectively as 
first-line statin drugs, but without the risks.39 In fact, the “side effects” of healthy 
eating tend to be good—less cancer and diabetes risk and protection of the liver and 
brain, as we’ll explore throughout the rest of this book. 
Heart Disease Is Reversible 
It’s never too early to start eating healthfully, but is it ever too late? Such lifestyle 
medicine pioneers as Nathan Pritikin, Dean Ornish, and Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. took 
patients with advanced heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet 
followed by Asian and African populations who didn’t suffer from heart disease. 
Their hope was that a healthy enough diet would stop the disease process and keep it 
from progressing further. 
But instead, something miraculous happened. 
Their patients’ heart disease started to reverse. These patients were getting 
better. As soon as they stopped eating an artery-clogging diet, their bodies were able 
to start dissolving away some of the plaque that had built up. Arteries opened up 
without drugs or surgery, even in some cases of patients with severe triple-vessel 
heart disease. This suggests their bodies wanted to heal all along but were just never 
given the chance.40 
Let me share with you what has been called the “best kept secret in medicine”:41 
Given the right conditions, the body heals itself. If you whack your shin really hard 
on a coffee table, it can get red, swollen, and painful. But your shin will heal 
naturally if you just stand back and let your body work its magic. But what if you kept 
whacking it in the same place three times a day—say, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner? 
It would never heal. 
You could go to your doctor and complain that your shin hurts. “No problem,” he 
or she might say, whipping out a pad to write you a prescription for painkillers. 
You’d go back home, still whacking your shin three times a day, but the pain pills 
would make it feel so much better. Thank heavens for modern medicine! That’s what 
happens when people take nitroglycerin for chest pain. Medicine can offer 
tremendous relief, but it’s not doing anything to treat the underlying cause. 
Your body wants to regain its health if you let it. But if you keep reinjuring 
yourself three times a day, you interrupt the healing process. Consider smoking and 
lung cancer risk: One of the most amazing things I learned in medical school was that 
within about fifteen years of stopping smoking, your lung-cancer risk approaches that 
of a lifelong nonsmoker.42 Your lungs can clear out all that tar buildup and, 
eventually, it’s almost as if you never smoked at all. 
Your body wants to be healthy. And every night of your smoking life, as you fall 
asleep, that healing process is restarted until … bam!—you light up your first 
cigarette the next morning. Just as you can reinjure your lungs with every puff, you 
can reinjure your arteries with every bite. You can choose moderation and hit 
yourself with a smaller hammer, but why beat yourself up at all? You can choose to 
stop damaging yourself, get out of your own way, and let your body’s natural healing 
process bring you back toward health. 
Endotoxins Crippling Your Arteries 
Unhealthy diets don’t just affect the structure of your arteries; an unhealthy diet can 
also affect their functioning. Your arteries are not merely inert pipes through which 
blood flows. They are dynamic, living organs. We’ve known for nearly two decades 
that a single fast-food meal—Sausage and Egg McMuffins were used in the original 
study—can stiffen your arteries within hours, cutting in half their ability to relax 
normally.43 And just as this inflammatory state starts to calm down five or six hours 
later—lunchtime! You may once again whack your arteries with another load of 
harmful food, leaving many Americans stuck in a danger zone of chronic, low-grade 
inflammation. Unhealthy meals don’t just cause internal damage decades down the 
road but right here and now, within hours of going into your mouth. 
Originally, researchers blamed the animal fat or animal protein, but attention has 
recently shifted to bacterial toxins known as “endotoxins.” Certain foods, such as 
meats, appear to harbor bacteria that can trigger inflammation dead or alive, even 
when the food is fully cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, 
stomach acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these 
endotoxins may end up in your intestines. They are then thought to be ferried by 
saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream, where they can trigger the 
inflammatory reaction in your arteries.44 
This may help explain the remarkable speed at which cardiac patients can 
experience relief when placed on a diet composed primarily of plant foods, including 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Dr. Ornish reported a 91 percent 
reduction in angina attacks within just a few weeks in patients placed on a plant- 
based diet both with45 or without46 exercise. This rapid resolution in chest pain 
occurred well before their bodies could have cleared the plaque from their arteries, 
suggesting plant-based diets don’t just help clean out arteries but also improve their 
day-to-day function. In contrast, control-group patients who were instead told to 
follow the advice of their doctors had a 186 percent increase in angina attacks.47 It’s 
no surprise their conditions worsened, given that they continued to eat the same diet 
that crippled their arteries in the first place. 
We’ve known about the dramatic power of dietary changes for decades. For 
example, there was a paper entitled “Angina and Vegan Diet” published in the 
American Heart Journal back in 1977. Vegan diets are exclusively plant based, 
avoiding meat, dairy, and eggs. Doctors described cases like that of Mr. F. W. 
(initials are often used to protect patient confidentiality), a sixty-five-year-old man 
with angina so severe he had to stop every nine or ten steps. He couldn’t even make it 
to the mailbox. He was started on a vegan diet, and his pain improved within days. 
Within months, he was reportedly climbing mountains with no pain at all.48 
Not ready to start eating healthier? Well, there is a new class of antiangina drugs, 
such as ranolazine (sold as Ranexa). A drug company executive suggested its product 
be used for people not “able to comply with the substantial dietary changes required 
to achieve a vegan diet.”49 The medication costs more than $2,000 a year, but the 
side effects are relatively minor, and it does work … technically speaking. At the 
highest dose, Ranexa was able to prolong exercise duration by 33.5 seconds.50 More 
than half a minute! It doesn’t look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing 
mountains anytime soon. 
Brazil Nuts for Cholesterol Control? 
Can a single serving of Brazil nuts bring down your cholesterol levels faster than 
statin drugs and keep them down even a month after that single meal? 
It was one of the craziest findings I’d ever seen. Researchers from—where else? 
—Brazil gave ten men and women a single meal containing between one and eight 
Brazil nuts. Amazingly, compared to the control group who ate no nuts at all, just a 
single serving of four Brazil nuts almost immediately improved cholesterol levels. 
LDL—the “bad”—cholesterol levels were a staggering twenty points lower just nine 
hours after eating the Brazil nuts.51 Even drugs don’t work nearly that fast.52 
Here’s the truly insane part: The researchers went back and measured the study 
participants’ cholesterol thirty days later. Even a month after ingesting a single 
serving of Brazil nuts, their cholesterol levels stayed down. 
Normally, when a study comes out in the medical literature showing some too- 
good-to-be-true result like this, doctors wait to see the results replicated before they 
change their clinical practice and begin recommending something new to their 
patients, particularly when the study is done on only ten subjects, and especially 
when the findings seem too incredible to believe. But when the intervention is cheap, 
easy, harmless, and healthy—we’re talking just four Brazil nuts per month—then in 
my opinion, the burden of proof is somewhat reversed. I think the reasonable default 
position is to do it until proven otherwise. 
More is not better, however. Brazil nuts are so high in the mineral selenium that 
eating four every day may actually bump you up against the tolerable daily limit for 
selenium. Nevertheless, this is not something you have to worry about if you’re only 
eating four Brazil nuts a month. 
Follow the Money 
Research showing that coronary heart disease can be reversed with a plant-based 
diet—with or without other healthy lifestyle changes—has been published for 
decades in some of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Why hasn’t 
this news translated into public policy yet? 
In 1977, the U.S. Senate Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs tried to do just 
that. Known as the McGovern Committee, they released Dietary Goals for the 
United States, a report advising Americans to cut down on animal-based foods and 
increase their consumption of plant-based foods. As a founding member of Harvard 
University’s nutrition department recalls, “The meat, milk and egg producers were 
very upset.”53 That’s an understatement. Under industry pressure, not only was the 
goal to “decrease meat consumption” removed from the report but the entire Senate 
nutrition committee was disbanded. Several prominent senators reputedly lost their 
election bids as a result of supporting the report.54 
In more recent years, it was uncovered that many members of the U.S. Dietary 
Guidelines Advisory Committee had financial ties to everything from candy bar 
companies to entities like McDonald’s Council on Healthy Lifestyles and Coca- 
Cola’s Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness. One committee member even 
served as “brand girl” for cake-mix maker Duncan Hines and then as the official 
Crisco “brand girl” before going on to help write the official Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans.55 
As one commentator noted in the Food and Drug Law Journal, historically, the 
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee reports contained: 
No discussion at all of the scientific research on the health consequences of 
eating meat. If the Committee actually discussed this research, it would be 
unable to justify its recommendation to eat meat, as the research would 
show that meat increases the risks of chronic diseases, contrary to the 
purposes of the Guidelines. Thus, by simply ignoring that research, the 
Committee is able to reach a conclusion that would otherwise look 
improper.56 
What about the medical profession, though? Why haven’t my colleagues fully 
embraced this research demonstrating the power of good nutrition? Sadly, the history 
of medicine holds many examples of the medical establishment rejecting sound 
science when it goes against the prevailing conventional wisdom. There’s even a 
name for it: the “Tomato Effect.” The term was coined in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association in reference to the fact that tomatoes were once 
considered poisonous and were shunned for centuries in North America, despite 
overwhelming evidence to the contrary.57 
It’s bad enough that most medical schools don’t even require a single course on 
nutrition,58 but it’s even worse when mainstream medical organizations actively 
lobby against increased nutrition education for physicians.59 When the American 
Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) was called out on their proud new corporate 
relationship with Coca-Cola to support patient education on healthy eating, an 
executive vice president of the academy tried to quell protests by explaining that this 
alliance was not without precedent. After all, they’d had relationships with PepsiCo 
and McDonald’s for some time.60 Even before that, they had financial ties to cigarette 
maker Philip Morris.61 
This argument didn’t seem to placate the critics, so the AAFP executive quoted 
them the American Dietetic Association’s policy statement that “[t]here are no good 
or bad foods, just good or bad diets.” No bad foods? Really? The tobacco industry 
used to broadcast a similar theme: Smoking per se wasn’t bad, only “excess” 
smoking.62 Sound familiar? Everything in moderation. 
The American Dietetic Association (ADA), which produces a series of nutrition 
fact sheets with guidelines on maintaining a healthy diet, also has its own corporate 
ties. Who writes these fact sheets? Food industry sources pay the ADA $20,000 per 
fact sheet to explicitly take part in the drafting process. So we can learn about eggs 
from the American Egg Board and about the benefits of chewing gum from the 
Wrigley Science Institute.63 
In 2012, the American Dietetic Association changed its name to the Academy of 
Nutrition and Dietetics but didn’t appear to change its policies. It continues to take 
millions of dollars every year from processed junk food, meat, dairy, soda, and 
candy bar companies. In return, the academy lets them offer official educational 
seminars to teach dietitians what to say to their clients.64 When you hear the title 
“registered dietitian,” this is the group they are registered through. Thankfully, a 
movement within the dietitian community, exemplified by the formation of the 
organization Dietitians for Professional Integrity, has started to buck this trend. 
What about individual doctors, though? Why aren’t all my colleagues telling their 
patients to lay off the Chick-fil-A? Insufficient time during office visits is a common 
excuse physicians cite, but the top reason doctors give for not counseling patients 
with high cholesterol to eat healthier is that they think patients may “fear privations 
related to dietary advice.”65 In other words, doctors perceive that patients would feel 
deprived of all the junk they’re eating. Can you imagine a doctor saying, “Yeah, I’d 
like to tell my patients to stop smoking, but I know how much they love it”? 
Neal Barnard, M.D., president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible 
Medicine, recently wrote a compelling editorial in the American Medical 
Association’s journal of ethics, describing how doctors went from being bystanders 
—or even enablers—of smoking to leading the fight against tobacco. Doctors 
realized they were more effective at counseling patients to quit smoking if they no 
longer had tobacco stains on their own fingers. 
Today, Dr. Barnard says, “Plant-based diets are the nutritional equivalent of 
quitting smoking.”66 
 CHAPTER 2 
How Not to Die from Lung Diseases 
The worst death I ever witnessed was that of a man dying of lung cancer. I was 
interning at a public health hospital in Boston. Evidently, people dying behind bars 
looked bad for prison statistics, so terminally ill prisoners were shipped to my 
hospital for their final days, even if there was little we could do for them. 
It was summer, and the prisoners’ ward had no air-conditioning, at least for the 
inmates. We doctors could retreat to the chilled confines of the nursing station, but 
the inmates, handcuffed to their beds, just lay prostrate in the heat on that top floor of 
the tall, brick building. When they were shuffled down the hall in front of us, ankles 
chained together, they left a trail of sweat. 
The night the man died, I was on one of my thirty-six-hour shifts. We worked 117- 
hour workweeks back then. It’s amazing we didn’t kill more people ourselves. 
Overnight, there were only two of us—myself and a moonlighting doctor who 
preferred to sleep for his $1,000 paycheck. So most of the time I was on my own to 
cover the hundreds of patients there, some of the sickest of the sick. It was on one of 
those nights that, staggering through a sleep-deprived haze, I got the call. 
Up until then, all the deaths I had seen were those in which the patient was either 
dead on arrival or had died during cardiac “codes,” when we try desperately, and 
nearly always unsuccessfully, to resuscitate. 
This man was different. 
He was wide-eyed, gasping for air, his cuffed hands clawing at the bed. The 
cancer was filling up his lungs with fluid. He was being drowned by lung cancer. 
While he thrashed desperately, pleading, my mind was in medical mode, all 
protocols and procedures, but nothing much could be done. The man needed 
morphine, but that was held on the other side of the ward, and I’d never get to it in 
time, let alone back to him. I was not popular on the prison floor. I had once reported 
a guard for beating a sick inmate and was rewarded with death threats. There was no 
way they’d let me through the gates fast enough. I begged the nurse to try to get some, 
but she didn’t make it back in time. 
The man’s coughing turned to gurgling. “Everything’s going to be okay,” I said. 
Immediately, I thought, What a stupid thing to say to someone choking to death. Just 
another lie in probably a long line of condescension from other authority figures 
throughout his life. Helpless, I turned from doctor back to human being. I took his 
hand in my own, which he then gripped with all his might, tugging me toward his 
tear-streaked, panic-stricken face. “I’m here,” I said. “I’m right here.” Our gaze 
remained locked as he suffocated right in front of me. It felt like watching someone 
being tortured to death. 
Take a deep breath. Now imagine what it would feel like not to be able to 
breathe. We all need to take care of our lungs. 
*   *   * 
America’s number-two killer, lung disease, claims the lives of about 300,000 people 
each year. And like our number-one domestic killer, heart disease, it’s largely 
preventable. Lung disease can come in many forms, but the three types that kill the 
most people are lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 
asthma. 
Lung cancer is our number-one cancer killer. Most of the 160,000 lung cancer 
deaths every year are the direct result of smoking. However, a healthy diet may help 
mitigate the DNA-damaging effects of tobacco smoke, as well as perhaps help 
prevent lung cancer from spreading. 
COPD kills approximately 140,000 people annually, from either damage to the 
walls of tiny air sacs in the lungs (emphysema) or from inflamed and thickened 
airways plugged with thick mucus (chronic bronchitis). Although there is no cure for 
the permanent lung scarring that COPD causes, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables 
may help slow the progression of the disease and improve lung function for its 
thirteen million sufferers. 
Finally, asthma, which claims 3,000 lives each year, is one of the most common 
chronic diseases among children, yet it may be largely preventable with a healthier 
diet. Research suggests a few extra daily servings of fruits and vegetables can reduce 
both the number of cases of asthma during childhood and the number of asthma 
attacks among people with the disease. 
LUNG CANCER 
Lung cancer is diagnosed about 220,000 times each year in the United States and 
causes more deaths annually than the next three cancers combined—those of the 
colon, breast, and pancreas.1 At any given moment, nearly 400,000 Americans are 
living under lung cancer’s dark shadow.2 Unlike with heart disease, which has yet to 
be fully acknowledged as the direct result of an artery-clogging diet, there is 
widespread recognition that tobacco is by far the most common cause of lung cancer. 
According to the American Lung Association, smoking tobacco contributes to up to 
90 percent of all lung cancer deaths. Men who smoke are twenty-three times more 
likely and women thirteen times more likely to develop lung cancer than nonsmokers. 
And smokers aren’t just harming themselves; thousands of deaths each year have been 
attributed to secondhand smoke. Nonsmokers have a 20–30 percent higher risk of 
developing lung cancer if they’re regularly exposed to cigarette smoke.3 
Those warning labels on cigarette packs are everywhere now, but for a long time, 
the link between smoking and lung cancer was suppressed by powerful interest 
groups—much as the relationship between certain foods and other leading killers is 
suppressed today. For example, in the 1980s, Philip Morris, the nation’s leading 
cigarette manufacturer, launched the notorious Whitecoat Project. The corporation 
hired doctors to publish ghostwritten studies purporting to negate links between 
secondhand smoke and lung disease. These papers cherry-picked various scientific 
reports to conceal and distort the damning evidence of the dangers of secondhand 
smoke. This whitewashing, coupled with the tobacco industry’s clever marketing 
campaigns, including cartoonlike ads, helped hook generations of Americans onto 
their products.4 
If, despite all the evidence and warnings, you’re currently a smoker, the most 
important step you can take is to stop. Now. Please. The benefits of quitting are 
immediate. According to the American Cancer Society, just twenty minutes after 
quitting, your heart rate and blood pressure drop. Within a few weeks, your blood 
circulation and lung function improve. Within a few months, the sweeper cells that 
help clean the lungs, remove mucus, and reduce the risk of infection start to regrow. 
And within a year of quitting, your smoking-related risk of coronary heart disease 
becomes half that of current smokers.5 As we saw in chapter 1, the human body 
possesses a miraculous ability to heal itself as long as we don’t keep reinjuring it. 
Simple dietary changes may help to roll back the damage wrought by the carcinogens 
in tobacco smoke. 
Load Up on Broccoli 
First, it’s important to understand the toxic effects of cigarettes on the lungs. Tobacco 
smoke contains chemicals that weaken the body’s immune system, making it more 
susceptible to disease and handicapping its ability to destroy cancer cells. At the 
same time, tobacco smoke can damage cell DNA, increasing the chance for cancer 
cells to form and flourish in the first place.6 
To test the power of dietary interventions to prevent DNA damage, scientists 
often study chronic smokers. Researchers rounded up a group of longtime smokers 
and asked them to consume twenty-five times more broccoli than the average 
American—in other words, a single stalk a day. Compared to broccoli-avoiding 
smokers, the broccoli-eating smokers suffered 41 percent fewer DNA mutations in 
their bloodstream over ten days. Is that just because the broccoli boosted the activity 
of the detoxifying enzymes in their livers, which helped clear carcinogens before they 
even made it to the smokers’ cells? No, even when DNA was extracted from the 
subjects’ bodies and exposed to a known DNA-damaging chemical, the genetic 
material from the broccoli eaters showed significantly less damage, suggesting that 
eating vegetables like broccoli may make you more resilient at a subcellular level.7 
Now, don’t think this means that eating a stalk of broccoli before smoking a pack 
of Marlboro Reds is going to completely erase the cancer-causing effects of cigarette 
smoke. It won’t. But as you’re trying to quit, such vegetables as broccoli, cabbage, 
and cauliflower may help prevent further damage. 
The benefits of broccoli-family (cruciferous) vegetables may not stop there. 
While breast cancer is the most common internal cancer among American women, 
lung cancer is actually their number-one killer. About 85 percent of women with 
breast cancer are still alive five years after diagnosis, but the numbers are reversed 
when it comes to lung cancer: 85 percent of women die within five years of a lung 
cancer diagnosis. Ninety percent of those deaths are due to metastasis, the spread of 
the cancer to other parts of the body.8 
Certain compounds in broccoli may have the potential to suppress this metastatic 
spread. In a 2010 study, scientists laid down a layer of human lung cancer cells in a 
petri dish and cleared a swath down the middle. Within twenty-four hours, the cancer 
cells had crept back together, and within thirty hours, the gap had closed completely. 
But when the scientists dripped some cruciferous-vegetable compounds onto the 
cancer cells, the cancer creep was stunted.9 Whether or not eating broccoli will help 
prolong survival in cancer patients has yet to be tested in clinical trials, but the nice 
thing about healthy dietary interventions is that since they have no downsides, they 
can be added to whatever other treatments one chooses. 
Smoking Versus Kale 
Researchers have found that kale—that dark-green, leafy vegetable dubbed the 
“queen of greens”—might help control cholesterol levels. Researchers took thirty 
men with high cholesterol and had them consume three to four shots of kale juice a 
day for three months. That’s like eating thirty pounds’ worth of kale, or the amount 
the average American consumes in about a century. So what happened? Did they turn 
green and start to photosynthesize? 
No. What the kale did do was substantially lower their bad (LDL) cholesterol and 
boost their good (HDL) cholesterol10 as much as running three hundred miles.11 By 
the end of the study, the antioxidant activity in the blood of most participants had shot 
up. But curiously, the antioxidant activity in a minority remained flat. Sure enough, 
these were the smokers. The free radicals created by the cigarettes were thought to 
have actively depleted the body of antioxidants. When your smoking habit erases the 
antioxidant-boosting effects of eight hundred cups of kale, you know it’s time to quit. 
Carcinogen-Blocking Effects of Turmeric 
The Indian spice turmeric, which gives curry powder its characteristic golden color, 
may also help prevent some of the DNA damage caused by smoking. Since 1987, the 
National Cancer Institute has tested more than a thousand different compounds for 
“chemopreventive” (cancer-preventing) activity. Only a few dozen have made it to 
clinical trials, but among the most promising is curcumin, the bright-yellow pigment 
in turmeric.12 
Chemopreventive agents can be classified into different subgroups based on 
which stage of cancer development they help to fight: Carcinogen blockers and 
antioxidants help prevent the initial triggering DNA mutation, and antiproliferatives 
work by keeping tumors from growing and spreading. Curcumin is special in that it 
appears to belong to all three groups, meaning it may potentially help prevent and/or 
arrest cancer cell growth.13 
Researchers have investigated the effects of curcumin on the DNA-mutating 
ability of various carcinogens and found that curcumin was indeed an effective 
antimutagen against several common cancer-causing substances.14 But these 
experiments were done in vitro, meaning effectively in a laboratory test tube. After 
all, it wouldn’t be ethical to expose humans to nasty carcinogens to observe whether 
they got cancer. However, someone got the bright idea of finding a group of people 
who already, of their own accord, had carcinogens coursing through their veins. 
Smokers! 
One way to measure the level of DNA-mutating chemicals in peoples’ bodies is 
dripping their urine on bacteria growing in a petri dish. Bacteria, like all life on 
Earth, share DNA as a common genetic language. Unsurprisingly, scientists who tried 
this experiment found that the urine from nonsmokers caused far fewer DNA 
mutations—after all, they had a lot fewer carcinogens flowing through their systems. 
But when the smokers were given turmeric, the DNA-mutation rate dropped by up to 
38 percent.15 They weren’t given curcumin pills; they merely got less than a teaspoon 
a day of just the regular turmeric spice you’d find at the grocery store. Of course, 
turmeric can’t completely mitigate the effects of smoking. Even after the participants 
ate turmeric for a month, the DNA-damaging ability of the smokers’ urine still 
exceeded that of the nonsmokers’. But smokers who make turmeric a staple of their 
diets may help lessen some of the damage. 
The anticancer effects of curcumin extend beyond its ability to potentially prevent 
DNA mutations. It also appears to help regulate programmed cell death. Your cells 
are preprogrammed to die naturally to make way for fresh cells through a process 
known as apoptosis (from the Greek ptosis, falling, and apo, away from). In a sense, 
your body is rebuilding itself every few months16 with the building materials you 
provide it through your diet. Some cells, however, overstay their welcome—namely, 
cancer cells. By somehow disabling their own suicide mechanism, they don’t die 
when they’re supposed to. Because they continue to thrive and divide, cancer cells 
can eventually form tumors and potentially spread throughout the body. 
So how does curcumin affect this process? It appears to have the ability to 
reprogram the self-destruct mechanism back into cancer cells. All cells contain so- 
called death receptors that trigger the self-destruction sequence, but cancer cells can 
disable their own death receptors. Curcumin, however, appears able to reactivate 
them.17 Curcumin can also kill cancer cells directly by activating “execution 
enzymes” called caspases inside cancer cells that destroy them from within by 
chopping up their proteins.18 Unlike most chemotherapy drugs, against which cancer 
cells can develop resistance over time, curcumin affects several mechanisms of cell 
death simultaneously, making it potentially harder for cancer cells to avoid 
destruction.19 
Curcumin has been found to be effective against a variety of other cancer cells in 
vitro, including those of the breast, brain, blood, colon, kidney, liver, lungs, and skin. 
For reasons not fully understood, curcumin seems to leave noncancerous cells 
alone.20 Unfortunately, turmeric has yet to be tested in clinical trials for the 
prevention or treatment of lung cancer, but with no downsides at culinary doses, I’d 
suggest trying to find ways to incorporate the spice into your diet. I offer a number of 
suggestions in part 2. 
Dietary Secondhand Smoke 
Though the majority of lung cancer is attributed to smoking, approximately a quarter 
of all cases occur in people who’ve never smoked.21 Although some of these cases 
are due to secondhand smoke, another contributing cause may be another potentially 
carcinogenic plume: fumes from frying. 
When fat is heated to frying temperatures, whether it be animal fat, such as lard, 
or plant fat, such as vegetable oil, toxic volatile chemicals with mutagenic properties 
(those able to cause genetic mutations) are released into the air.22 This happens even 
before the “smoke point” temperature is reached.23 If you do fry at home, good 
ventilation in the kitchen may reduce lung cancer risk.24 
Cancer risk may also depend on what’s being fried. A study of women in China 
found that smokers who stir-fried meat every day had nearly three times the odds of 
lung cancer compared to smokers who stir-fried foods other than meat on a daily 
basis.25 This is thought to be because of a group of carcinogens called heterocyclic 
amines that are formed when muscle tissue is subjected to high temperatures. (We’ll 
talk more about these in chapter 11.) 
The effects of meat fumes can be hard to separate from the effects of eating the 
meat itself, but a recent study on pregnant women and barbecuing attempted to tease 
them out. When meat is grilled, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also 
produced, one of the probable carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The researchers 
discovered that not only was the ingestion of grilled meat in the third trimester 
associated with smaller birth weights, mothers merely exposed to the fumes tended to 
give birth to babies with a birth weight deficit. Exposure to the fumes was also 
associated with a smaller head size, an indicator of brain volume.26 Air pollution 
studies suggest prenatal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may then 
translate into adverse effects on children’s future cognitive development (as 
manifested by a significantly lower IQ).27 
Even just living next to a restaurant may pose a health hazard. Scientists estimated 
the lifetime cancer risk among those residing near the exhaust outlets at Chinese 
restaurants, American restaurants, and barbecue joints. While exposure to fumes from 
all three types of restaurants resulted in exposure to unsafe levels of PAHs, the 
Chinese restaurants proved to be the worst. This is thought to be due to the amount of 
fish being cooked,28 as the fumes from pan-fried fish have been found to contain high 
levels of PAHs capable of damaging the DNA of human lung cells. 29 Given the 
excess cancer risk, the researchers concluded that it wouldn’t be safe to live near the 
exhaust of a Chinese restaurant for more than a day or two a month.30 
What about that enticing aroma of sizzling bacon? The fumes produced by frying 
bacon contain a class of carcinogens called nitrosamines.31 Although all meat may 
release potentially carcinogenic fumes, processed meat like bacon may be the worst: 
A UC-Davis study found that bacon fumes cause about four times more DNA 
mutations than the fumes from beef patties fried at similar temperatures.32 
What about tempeh bacon? Tempeh is a fermented soybean product used to make 
a variety of meat substitutes. Researchers compared the DNA-mutating effects of the 
fumes from frying bacon and beef to tempeh. The bacon and burger fumes were 
mutagenic, but the tempeh fumes were not. Nevertheless, it’s still not a good idea to 
eat fried foods. Though no DNA changes were detected after exposure to tempeh 
smoke, the fried tempeh itself did cause some DNA mutations (though 45 times fewer 
than the beef and 346 times fewer than the bacon). The researchers proposed that 
these findings might account for the higher incidence of respiratory diseases and lung 
cancer among cooks and lower incidence overall among vegetarians.33 
If you do need to be around frying bacon or eggs, it would be safer to limit your 
exposure by using a backyard grill. Studies show that the number of particles 
deposited into the lungs increases by a factor of ten when frying indoors versus 
outdoors.34 
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema and chronic 
bronchitis, is a condition that makes it difficult to breathe and gets worse and worse 
over time. In addition to shortness of breath, COPD can cause severe coughing, 
excess mucus production, wheezing, and chest tightness. The disease affects more 
than twenty-four million Americans.35 
Smoking is far and away the leading cause of COPD, but other factors can 
contribute, such as prolonged exposure to air pollution. Unfortunately, there is no 
cure for COPD, but there is some good news: A healthy diet may help to prevent 
COPD and help keep it from getting worse. 
Data going back fifty years show that a high intake of fruits and vegetables is 
positively associated with good lung function.36 Just one extra serving of fruit each 
day may translate into a 24 percent lower risk of dying from COPD.37 On the other 
hand, a twin pair of studies from Columbia and Harvard Universities found that 
consumption of cured meat—like bacon, bologna, ham, hot dogs, sausage, and salami 
—may increase the risk of COPD.38,39 It’s thought to be due to the nitrite 
preservatives in meat, which may mimic the lung-damaging properties of the nitrite 
by-products of cigarette smoke.40 
What if you already have the disease? Can the same foods that appear to help 
prevent COPD be used to treat it? We didn’t know until a landmark study was 
published in 2010. More than a hundred COPD patients were randomized into two 
groups—half were instructed to boost their fruit and vegetable consumption, while 
the others remained on their normal diet. Over the next three years, the standard-diet 
subjects became progressively worse, as expected. In contrast, the disease 
progression was halted in the group consuming more fruits and veggies. Not only did 
their lung function not get worse, it actually improved a little. The researchers 
suggested this could be due to a combination of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
effects of the fruits and vegetables, along with a potential reduction in the 
consumption of meat, which is thought to act as a pro-oxidant.41 
Regardless of the mechanism, a diet with more whole plant foods may help both 
prevent and arrest the progression of this leading killer. 
ASTHMA 
Asthma is an inflammatory disease characterized by recurring attacks of narrowed, 
swollen airways, causing shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Asthma can 
start at any age, but it usually emerges during childhood. One of the most common 
chronic diseases in kids, asthma’s prevalence has been increasing year after year.42 
In the United States, twenty-five million people suffer from asthma, and seven million 
of them are children.43 
A groundbreaking study recently demonstrated that the rates of asthma vary 
dramatically around the world. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in 
Childhood followed more than a million children in nearly one hundred countries, 
making it the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken of this disease. The study 
found a twentyfold to sixtyfold difference in the prevalence of asthma, allergies, and 
eczema.44 Why does the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis (itchy eyes and runny nose) 
range from 1 percent of children in parts of India, for instance, to as much as 45 
percent elsewhere?45 While such factors as air pollution and smoking rates may play 
a role, the most significant associations were not with what was going into their lungs 
but what was going into their stomachs.46 
Adolescents living in areas where more starchy foods, grains, vegetables, and 
nuts were consumed were significantly less likely to exhibit chronic symptoms of 
wheezing, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and allergic eczema.47 Boys and girls eating 
two or more servings of vegetables a day appear to have only half the odds of 
suffering from allergic asthma.48 In general, the prevalence of asthma and respiratory 
symptoms reportedly appears to be lower among populations eating more foods of 
plant origin.49 
Foods of animal origin have been associated with increased asthma risk. A study 
of more than one hundred thousand adults in India found that those who consumed 
meat daily, or even occasionally, were significantly more likely to suffer from asthma 
than those who excluded meat and eggs from their diets altogether.50 Eggs (along with 
soda) have also been associated with asthma attacks in children, along with 
respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and exercise-induced 
coughing.51 Removing eggs and dairy from the diet has been shown to improve 
asthmatic children’s lung function in as few as eight weeks.52 
The mechanism by which diet affects airway inflammation may lie with the thin 
coating of fluid that forms the interface between your respiratory-tract lining and the 
outside air. Using the antioxidants obtained from the fruits and vegetables you eat, 
this fluid acts as your first line of defense against the free radicals that contribute to 
asthmatic airway hypersensitivity, contraction, and mucus production.53 Oxidation 
by-products can be measured in exhaled breath and are significantly lowered by 
shifting toward a more plant-based diet.54 
So if asthmatics eat fewer fruits and vegetables, does their lung function decline? 
Researchers out of Australia tried removing fruits and vegetables from asthma 
patients’ diets to see what would happen. Within two weeks, asthma symptoms grew 
significantly worse. Interestingly, the low-fruit, low-vegetable diet used in the study 
—a restriction to no more than one serving of fruit and two servings of vegetables 
per day—is typical of Western diets. In other words, the diet they used 
experimentally to impair people’s lung function and worsen their asthma was 
effectively the standard American diet.55 
What about improving asthma by adding fruits and vegetables? Researchers 
repeated the experiment, but this time increased fruit and vegetable consumption to 
seven servings a day. This simple act of adding a few more fruits and vegetables to 
their daily diet ended up successfully cutting the study subjects’ exacerbation rate in 
half.56 That’s the power of eating healthfully. 
If it’s the antioxidants, why not just take an antioxidant supplement? After all, 
popping a pill is easier than eating an apple. The reason is simple: Supplements 
don’t appear to work. Studies have repeatedly shown that antioxidant supplements 
have no beneficial effects on respiratory or allergic diseases, underscoring the 
importance of eating whole foods rather than trying to take isolated components or 
extracts in pill form.57 For example, the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study found that 
women who obtained high levels of vitamin E from a nut-rich diet appeared to have 
nearly half the risk of asthma of those who didn’t, but those who took vitamin E 
supplements saw no benefit at all.58 
Who do you think did better? A group of asthma patients who ate seven servings a 
day of fruits and vegetables, or a group who ate three servings plus fifteen “serving 
equivalents” in pill form? Sure enough, the pills didn’t seem to help at all. 
Improvements in lung function and asthma control were evident only after subjects 
increased their actual fruit and vegetable intake, strongly suggesting that consuming 
whole foods is paramount.59 
If adding a few daily servings of fruits and vegetables can have such a significant 
effect, what if asthma sufferers were put on a diet composed entirely of plant foods? 
Researchers in Sweden decided to test out a strictly plant-based diet on a group of 
severe asthmatics who weren’t getting better despite the best medical therapies— 
thirty-five patients with long-established, physician-verified asthma, twenty of whom 
had been admitted to hospitals for acute attacks during the previous two years. One 
patient had received emergency intravenous infusions a total of twenty-three times, 
another reported he’d been hospitalized more than a hundred times, and one subject 
had even suffered a cardiac arrest after an attack and had to be revived and placed on 
a ventilator.60 These were some pretty serious cases. 
Of the twenty-four patients who stuck with the plant-based diet, 70 percent 
improved after four months, and 90 percent improved within one year. And these 
were all people who had experienced no improvement in their conditions at all in the 
year prior to switching to a plant-based diet.61 
Within just one year of eating healthier, all but two patients were able to drop 
their dose of asthma medication or get off their steroids and other drugs altogether. 
Objective measures like lung function and physical working capacity improved; 
meanwhile, subjectively, some patients said their improvement was so considerable 
that they felt like “they had a new life.”62 
There was no control group, so the placebo effect may have accounted for some 
of the improvement, but the nice thing about a healthier diet is that there are only 
good side effects. In addition to improvements in their asthma control, the study 
subjects lost an average of eighteen pounds, and their cholesterol and blood 
pressures got better. From a risk-benefit standpoint, then, it’s definitely worth giving 
a plant-based diet a try. 
*   *   * 
The most lethal lung diseases vary widely in presentation and prognosis. As noted, 
smoking is far and away the leading cause of lung cancer and COPD, but diseases 
like asthma typically develop during childhood and can be associated with a range of 
contributing factors, such as low birth weight and frequent respiratory infections. 
While quitting smoking remains the most effective way to ward off the worst kinds of 
lung disease, we can also help the body bolster its defenses by eating a diet rich in 
protective plant foods. The same kind of diet that appears to help severe asthmatics 
may also help prevent all three diseases from occurring in the first place. 
If you’re one of the millions of Americans who already suffer from lung disease, 
quitting smoking and changing your diet can still make a difference. It’s never too late 
to start living and eating healthier. The restorative powers of the human body are 
remarkable, but your body needs your help. By including foods that contain cancer- 
fighting compounds and loading up on antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies, you may be 
able to strengthen your respiratory defenses and breathe easier. 
In my clinical practice, whenever I’ve felt under too much time pressure to 
address a patient’s smoking or bad dietary habits, I stop and think back to the hideous 
death of that man in Boston. No one deserves to die like that. I’d like to think no one 
has to. 
 CHAPTER 3 
How Not to Die from Brain Diseases 
My mom’s father died of a stroke, and her mother died of Alzheimer’s disease. 
As a kid, I loved going to see my grandma in Long Island. We lived out west, so I 
got to fly on a plane—sometimes all by myself! She was the perfect—and perfectly 
doting—grandmother. She’d want to take me to toy stores, but, geeky me, I just 
wanted to go to the library. When we’d get back to the house, my arms filled with 
borrowed books, she’d let me sit way back on her big couch—shoes off, of course— 
and read and draw pictures. Then she’d bring me blueberry muffins she made with a 
big mechanical mixer that took up half the kitchen counter. 
Later in life, my grandma started to lose her mind. By then, I was in medical 
school, but my newfound knowledge was useless. She had turned. My previously 
sweet and stately grandmother? Now she threw things at people. She cursed. Her 
caretaker showed me the teeth marks on her arm where my once kind, loving grandma 
had bitten her. 
That’s the horror of brain disease. Unlike a problem with your foot or your back 
or even another vital organ, brain disease can attack your self. 
The two most serious brain diseases are stroke, which kills nearly 130,000 
Americans each year,1 and Alzheimer’s disease, which kills nearly 85,000.2 Most 
strokes can be thought of as “brain attacks”—like heart attacks, but the rupturing 
plaques in your arteries cut off blood flow to parts of the brain rather than to parts of 
the heart. Alzheimer’s is more like a mind attack. 
Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most physically and emotionally burdensome 
diseases, for both sufferers and caregivers. Unlike stroke, which can kill instantly 
and without any warning, Alzheimer’s involves a slower, more subtle decline over 
months or years. Instead of cholesterol-filled plaques in your arteries, plaques made 
of a substance called amyloid develop in the brain tissue itself, associated with the 
loss of memory and, eventually, loss of life. 
While the pathology of stroke and Alzheimer’s are different, one key factor unites 
them: Mounting evidence suggests that a healthy diet may help prevent them both. 
STROKE 
In about 90 percent of strokes,3 blood flow to part of the brain gets cut off, depriving 
it of oxygen and killing off the part fed by the clogged artery. That’s called an 
ischemic stroke (from the Latin ischaemia, meaning “stopping blood”). A small 
minority of strokes are hemorrhagic strokes, which are caused by bleeding into the 
brain when a blood vessel bursts. The damage wrought by a stroke depends on which 
area of the brain was deprived of oxygen (or where bleeding occurred) and for how 
long the deprivation lasted. People who experience a brief stroke might only need to 
contend with arm or leg weakness, while those who suffer a major stroke can 
develop paralysis, lose the ability to speak, or, as is too often the case, die. 
Sometimes the blood clot lasts only a moment—not long enough to notice but still 
long enough to kill off a tiny portion of your brain. These so-called silent strokes can 
multiply and slowly reduce cognitive function until full-blown dementia develops.4 
The goal is to reduce the risk of both the massive strokes that can kill you instantly 
and the ministrokes that kill you over the course of years. Just as with heart disease, a 
healthy diet can reduce stroke risk by reducing cholesterol and blood pressure while 
improving blood flow and antioxidant capacity. 
Fiber! Fiber! Fiber! 
In addition to its well-known effects on bowel health, high fiber intake appears to 
reduce the risk of cancers of the colon5 and breast,6 diabetes,7 heart disease,8 
obesity,9 and premature death in general.10 A number of studies now show that high 
fiber intake may also help ward off stroke.11 Unfortunately, less than 3 percent of 
Americans meet the minimum daily recommendation for fiber.12 This means about 97 
percent of Americans eat fiber-deficient diets. Fiber is naturally concentrated in only 
one place: whole plant foods. Processed foods have less, and animal-derived foods 
have no fiber at all. Animals have bones to hold them up; plants have fiber. 
It apparently doesn’t take much fiber to cut stroke risk. Increasing fiber intake by 
just seven grams a day may be associated with a 7 percent risk reduction.13 Different 
strokes for different folks—depending, evidently, on how much fiber they ate. An 
additional seven grams of fiber is easy to add to your diet; it’s the equivalent of a 
bowl of oatmeal with berries or a serving of baked beans. 
How does fiber protect the brain? We’re not exactly sure. We do know that fiber 
helps control your cholesterol14 and blood sugar levels,15 which can help reduce the 
amount of artery-clogging plaque in your brain’s blood vessels. High-fiber diets may 
also lower blood pressure,16 which reduces the risk of brain bleeds. But scientists 
don’t have to know the exact mechanism before you act on this knowledge. As the 
biblical passage goes: “A man scatters seed on the ground … the seed sprouts and 
grows, though he does not know how.” Had the farmer from scripture postponed his 
sowing until he understood the biology of seed germination, he wouldn’t have lasted 
very long. So why not go ahead and reap the benefits of eating fiber by eating more 
unprocessed plant foods? 
It’s never too early to start eating healthier. Though stroke is considered an older 
person’s disease—only about 2 percent of stroke deaths occur before the age of 
forty-five17—the risk factors may begin accumulating in childhood. In a remarkable 
study published recently, hundreds of children were followed for a period of twenty- 
four years, from junior high school to adulthood. Researchers found that low fiber 
intake early on was associated with stiffening of the arteries leading up to the brain— 
a key risk factor for stroke. By the time these adolescents were only fourteen, clear 
differences in arterial health were found for those consuming different amounts of 
fiber in their daily diets.18 
Again, it did not appear to take much. One more apple, an extra quarter cup of 
broccoli, or just two tablespoons of beans a day during childhood could translate into 
a meaningful effect on artery health later in life.19 If you really want to be proactive, 
the best available science20 suggests you can minimize stroke risk by eating a 
minimum of 25 grams a day of soluble fiber (fiber that dissolves in water, typically 
found in beans, oats, nuts, and berries) and 47 daily grams of insoluble fiber (fiber 
that does not dissolve in water, found primarily in whole grains, such as brown rice 
and whole wheat). Granted, you’d have to eat an extraordinarily healthy diet to attain 
this level of fiber intake, far beyond what is arbitrarily determined as adequate by 
most health authorities.21 Rather than patronizing you with what they think is 
“achievable”22 by the masses, though, I wish these authorities would just tell you 
what the science says and let you make up your own mind. 
Potassium 
Take a plant, any plant, and burn it to ash. Throw that ash in a pot of water, boil it, 
skim off the ashes, and eventually you’ll be left with a white residue known as potash 
(“pot ash”). Potash has been used for millennia for making everything from soap and 
glass to fertilizer and bleach. It wasn’t until 1807 that an English chemist figured out 
that this “vegetable alkali” contained an undiscovered element, which he called pot- 
ash-ium—that is, potassium. 
I mention this simply to emphasize the primary source of potassium in your diet— 
namely, plants. Every cell in your body requires potassium to function, and you need 
to get it from your diet. For much of human history, we ate so many plants that we got 
upward of 10,000 mg of potassium every day.23 Nowadays, less than 2 percent of 
Americans even reach the recommended daily intake of 4,700 mg.24 
The major reason is simple: We don’t eat enough unprocessed plant foods.25 What 
does potassium have to do with stroke? A review of all the best studies on the 
relationship between potassium and our top-two killers, heart disease and stroke, 
determined that a 1,640 mg increase per day in potassium intake was associated with 
a 21 percent reduction in stroke risk.26 That isn’t enough to bring the average 
American’s potassium levels to where they should be, but it’s still enough to 
substantially reduce the risk of stroke. Imagine how much lower your risk would be if 
you doubled or tripled your intake of whole plant foods. 
Bananas, although they’ve been marketed for their potassium content, aren’t 
actually particularly rich in the mineral. According to the current U.S. Department of 
Agriculture database, bananas don’t even make the list of the top-thousand foods with 
the highest levels of potassium; in fact, they come in at number 1,611, right after 
Reese’s Pieces.27 You’d have to eat a dozen bananas a day just to get the bare 
minimum recommended amount of potassium. 
What are some of the truly potassium-rich foods? The healthiest common whole- 
food sources are probably greens, beans, and sweet potatoes.28 
Citrus 
Good news for all you orange lovers: Citrus fruit intake has been associated with 
reduced stroke risk—even more so than apples.29 Say I can’t compare them? I just 
did! The key may lie with a citrus phytonutrient called hesperidin, which appears to 
increase blood flow throughout the body, including the brain. Using a machine known 
as a doppler fluximeter, scientists can measure blood flow through the skin using a 
laser beam. If we hook people up to this machine and give them a solution containing 
the amount of hesperidin found in two cups of orange juice, blood pressure decreases 
and overall blood flow increases. When subjects drank straight orange juice instead 
of the hesperidin solution, their blood flow was even better. In other words, the 
stroke-reducing effects of oranges extend beyond just the hesperidin.30 When it comes 
to food, the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts. 
The positive effects of citrus fruits on blood flow don’t require a machine to 
measure them. In one study, scientists recruited women who suffered from sensitivity 
to cold weather due to poor blood flow—women with chronically cold hands, feet, 
and toes—and placed them in a highly air-conditioned room. The women in the 
experimental group drank a solution containing actual citrus phytonutrients, while 
another (control) group drank a placebo (an artificially flavored orange drink). The 
placebo drinkers got colder and colder. Because of decreased blood flow, the 
temperature of their fingertips dropped nearly 9 degrees Fahrenheit during the course 
of the study. The fingertips of the women who drank real citrus, meanwhile, cooled 
less than half as fast, because their blood flow remained steadier. (The researchers 
also had both groups of women plunge their hands into icy water and saw the citrus 
drinkers recover about 50 percent faster than the control group.)31 
So eating a few oranges before snowboarding may help keep your fingers and toes 
from getting as chilly. But while warm digits are nice, the reduced stroke risk 
associated with higher citrus intake is even nicer. 
Optimal Sleep Duration and Stroke 
Lack of sleep, or even too much of it, is associated with increased stroke risk.32 But 
how much sleep may be too little? How much too much? 
Scientists in Japan were the first to take a major stab at this question. They 
followed nearly 100,000 middle-aged men and women for fourteen years. Compared 
with people who slept an average of seven hours per night, subjects who got four 
hours of sleep or less, or ten hours or more, had roughly a 50 percent greater 
likelihood of dying from a stroke.33 
A recent study of 150,000 Americans was able to examine the issue more 
thoroughly. Higher stroke rates were found among individuals sleeping six hours or 
less, or nine hours or more. Those at lowest risk got around seven or eight hours of 
sleep a night.34 Large studies in Europe,35 China,36 and elsewhere37 have confirmed 
that seven or eight hours appears to be associated with the lowest risk. We’re not 
sure if the relationship is cause and effect, but until we know more, why not aim for 
that range? Sleep well! 
Antioxidants and Stroke 
Awarded the National Medal of Science, the highest honor for scientific achievement 
in this country, revered biochemist Earl Stadtman was quoted as saying, “Aging is a 
disease. The human lifespan simply reflects the level of free radical damage that 
accumulates in cells. When enough damage accumulates, cells can’t survive properly 
anymore and they just give up.”38 
First proposed in 1972,39 this concept—now called the mitochondrial theory of 
aging—suggests that free radical damage to your cells’ power source, known as 
mitochondria, leads to a loss of cellular energy and function over time. This process 
may be a little like charging your iPod battery over and over—each time, its capacity 
gets less and less. 
But what exactly are free radicals, and what can we do about them? 
Here’s my best attempt to simplify the quantum biology of oxidative 
phosphorylation: Plants get their energy from the sun. You take a plant and place it in 
the sun, and through a process called photosynthesis, the chlorophyll in the leaves 
harnesses the sun’s energy and transfers it to tiny building blocks of matter called 
electrons. 
The plant starts out with low-energy electrons and, using the energy of the sun, 
charges them up into high-energy electrons. In this way, plants store the sun’s energy. 
When you then eat the plant (or the animals who ate the plant), these electrons (in the 
form of carbohydrates, protein, and fat) are delivered to all your cells. Then your 
mitochondria take the plant’s power-packed electrons and use them as an energy 
source—that is, as fuel—and slowly release their energy. Mind you, this process has 
to occur in a precise, tightly controlled manner, because these electrons are packed 
with energy and are therefore volatile, like gasoline. 
In fact, gasoline, petroleum, oil, and charcoal aren’t called fossil fuels for 
nothing. The tanks of our SUVs are filled with mostly prehistoric plant matter that 
stored the energy of the sun that shone millions of years ago as high-energy electrons. 
And just as it would be dangerous to toss a match into a can of gasoline and 
release all its energy at once, your body has to be cautious. That’s why your cells 
take these same high-energy electrons from the plants you eat and release their energy 
in a controlled manner, like a gas stove—just a little at a time until the energy is used 
up. Your body then passes these used-up electrons to an all-important molecule you 
may have heard of: oxygen. In fact, the way poisons like cyanide kill you is by 
preventing your body from giving up these spent electrons to oxygen. 
Fortunately, oxygen loves electrons, although maybe a little too much. While your 
body is taking its sweet time, slowly releasing the electrons’ energy, the oxygen is 
waiting impatiently at the end of the line. Oxygen would love to get its grubby little 
hands on one of those high-energy electrons, but your body says, “Hold on. We’ve 
got to do this slowly, so wait your turn and let it cool off first. We’ll give you your 
electron, but only after we’ve removed the energy so it’s safe to play with.” 
Then the oxygen molecule gets all huffy and exclaims, “I could handle one of them 
souped-up electrons any day!” Pouting, it spies a stray high-energy electron sitting 
out in the open. Oxygen looks left, looks right, and then pounces on it. Your body 
isn’t perfect; it can’t keep an eye on oxygen all the time. About 1–2 percent40 of all 
high-energy electrons that pass through your cells leak out where oxygen can grab 
them. 
When oxygen gets its hands on a high-energy electron, it basically turns into the 
Hulk, changing from lowly oxygen into what’s called superoxide, a type of free 
radical. A free radical is what it sounds like—a molecule that can be unstable, out of 
control, and violently reactive. The superoxide is just pumped up with energy and 
can start smashing around the cell, knocking stuff over and tripping over your DNA. 
When superoxide comes in contact with DNA, it can damage your genes, which, if 
not repaired, can cause mutations in your chromosomes that may lead to cancer.41 
Thankfully, the body calls in its defense squad, known as antioxidants. They arrive at 
the scene and say, “Drop that electron!” 
The superoxide fights back. “You want a piece of me, Mr. Vitamin C? Bring it!” 
So the antioxidants proceed to jump the superoxide and wrestle the supercharged 
electron away from it, leaving behind poor little oxygen and its ripped jeans. 
In scientific circles, the phenomenon by which oxygen molecules grab stray 
electrons and go crazy is called oxidant, or oxidative, stress. According to the theory, 
the resulting cellular damage is what essentially causes aging. Aging and disease 
have been thought of as the oxidation of the body. Those brown age spots on the back 
of your hands? They’re just oxidized fat under the skin. Oxidant stress is thought to be 
why we all get wrinkles, why we lose some of our memory, why our organ systems 
break down as we get older. Basically, the theory goes, we’re rusting. 
You can slow down this oxidant process by eating foods containing lots of 
antioxidants. You can tell whether a food is rich in antioxidants by slicing it open, 
exposing it to air (oxygen), and then seeing what happens. If it turns brown, it’s 
oxidizing. Think about our two most popular fruits: apples and bananas. They turn 
brown quickly, which means there aren’t a lot of antioxidants inside them. (Most of 
the antioxidants in apples are in the peels.) Cut open a mango and what happens? 
Nothing happens, because there are lots of antioxidants in there. How do you keep 
fruit salad from turning brown? By adding lemon juice, which contains the 
antioxidant vitamin C. Antioxidants can keep your food from oxidizing, and they may 
do the same inside your body. 
One of the diseases antioxidant-rich foods may help prevent is stroke. Swedish 
researchers followed more than thirty thousand older women over a period of a 
dozen years and found that those who ate the most antioxidant-rich foods had the 
lowest stroke risk.42 Similar findings were reported in a younger cohort of men and 
women in Italy.43 As with lung disease,44 antioxidant supplements don’t appear to 
help.45 Mother Nature’s powers cannot be stuffed into a pill. 
Knowing this, scientists set out to find the most antioxidant-rich foods. Sixteen 
researchers spanning the globe published a database of the antioxidant power of 
more than a whopping three thousand foods, beverages, herbs, spices, and 
supplements. They tested everything from Cap’n Crunch cereal to the crushed dried 
leaves of the African baobab tree. They tested dozens of brands of beer to see which 
has the most antioxidants. (Santa Claus beer from Eggenberg, Austria, tied for first 
place.)46 Sadly, beer represents Americans’ fourth-largest source of dietary 
antioxidants.47 You can check out the list to see where your favorite foods and 
beverages rank at this link: http://bit.ly/antioxidantfoods. 
No need to post the 138-page chart on your fridge, though. Here’s the simple rule: 
On average, plant foods contain sixty-four times more antioxidants than animal 
foods. As the researchers put it, “[A]ntioxidant rich foods originate from the plant 
kingdom while meat, fish and other foods from the animal kingdom are low in 
antioxidants.”48 Even the least healthy plant food I can think of, good old American 
iceberg lettuce (which is 96 percent water!49), contains 17 units (daμmol using a 
modified FRAP assay) of antioxidant power. Some berries have more than 1,000 
units, to give you some perspective, making iceberg look pretty pathetic. But compare 
iceberg lettuce’s 17 units to fresh salmon, which has only 3 units. Chicken? As few 
as 5 units of antioxidant power. Skim milk or a hard-boiled egg? Just 4 units, and Egg 
Beaters has a big old goose egg—0 units. “Diets comprised mainly of animal-based 
foods are thus low in antioxidant content,” concluded the research team, “while diets 
based mainly on a variety of plant-based foods are antioxidant rich, due to the 
thousands of bioactive antioxidant phytochemicals found in plants which are 
conserved in many foods and beverages.”50 
There is no need to necessarily cherry-pick individual foods to boost your 
antioxidant intake (though cherries do have up to 714!); you can simply strive to 
include a variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices at every meal. This way, you 
can continuously flood your body with antioxidants to help ward off stroke and other 
age-related diseases. 
Antioxidants, in a Pinch 
The food category that averages the most antioxidants is herbs and spices. 
Let’s say you prepare a nice healthy bowl of whole-wheat pasta with marinara 
sauce. Together, they may achieve a score of about 80 units of antioxidant power 
(approximately 20 units from the pasta and 60 from the sauce). Add in a handful of 
steamed broccoli florets, and you may end up with a delicious 150-unit meal. Not 
bad. Now sprinkle on a single teaspoonful of dried oregano or marjoram, oregano’s 
sweeter and milder twin. That alone could double your meal’s antioxidant power, up 
to more than 300 units.51 
How about a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast? By adding just a half-teaspoon of 
cinnamon, you could bring the antioxidant power of your meal from 20 units to 120 
units. And if you can stand the punch, adding even a pinch of cloves could bring your 
unassuming breakfast up to an antioxidant score of 160 units. 
Plant-based meals tend to be rich in antioxidants on their own, but taking a 
moment to spice up your life may make your meal even healthier. 
Antioxidant-rich diets appear to protect against stroke by preventing the 
circulation of oxidized fats in the bloodstream that can damage the sensitive walls of 
small blood vessels in the brain.52 They can also help decrease artery stiffness,53 
prevent blood clots from forming,54 and lower blood pressure55 and inflammation. 
Free radicals can disfigure proteins in our bodies to the extent they become 
unrecognizable by our immune systems.56 The inflammatory response this triggers can 
be prevented by saturating our bodies with sufficient antioxidants. Whereas all whole 
plant foods may have anti-inflammatory effects,57 some plants are better than others. 
High-antioxidant fruits and vegetables, such as berries and greens, have been found 
to douse systemic inflammation significantly better than the same number of servings 
of more common low-antioxidant fruits and veggies, such as bananas and lettuce.58 
The foods we choose make a difference. 
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE 
In my clinical practice, the one diagnosis I dreaded giving more than cancer was 
Alzheimer’s. It wasn’t just because of the psychological toll to come for the patient 
but because of the emotional toll that would be placed on loved ones. The 
Alzheimer’s Foundation estimates that fifteen million friends and family members 
supply more than fifteen billion unpaid hours annually caring for loved ones who may 
not even recognize them.59 
Despite the billions of dollars spent on research, there is still neither a cure nor 
an effective treatment for the disease, which invariably progresses to death. In short, 
Alzheimer’s is reaching a state of crisis—emotionally, economically, and even 
scientifically. Over the past two decades, more than seventy-three thousand research 
articles have been published on the disease. That’s about a hundred papers a day. Yet 
very little clinical progress has been made in treating or even understanding it. And a 
total cure is likely impossible, given that lost cognitive function in Alzheimer’s 
patients may never be regained due to fatally damaged neuronal networks. Dead 
nerve cells cannot be brought back to life. Even if drug companies can figure out how 
to halt the disease’s progression, for many patients, the damage has already been 
done, and the individual’s personality may be forever lost.60 
The good news, as a senior scientist at the Center for Alzheimer’s Research 
entitled a review article, is that “Alzheimer’s Disease Is Incurable but 
Preventable.”61 Diet and lifestyle changes could potentially prevent millions of cases 
a year.62 How? There is an emerging consensus that “what is good for our hearts is 
also good for our heads,”63 because clogging of the arteries inside of the brain with 
atherosclerotic plaque is thought to play a pivotal role in the development of 
Alzheimer’s disease.64 It is not surprising, then, that the dietary centerpiece of the 
2014 “Dietary and Lifestyle Guidelines for the Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease,” 
published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, was: “Vegetables, legumes (beans, 
peas, and lentils), fruits, and whole grains should replace meats and dairy products 
as primary staples of the diet.”65 
Is Alzheimer’s a Vascular Disorder? 
In 1901, a woman named Auguste was taken to an insane asylum in Frankfurt, 
Germany, by her husband. She was described as a delusional, forgetful, disoriented 
woman who “could not carry out her homemaking duties.”66 She was seen by a Dr. 
Alzheimer and was to become the subject of the case that made Alzheimer a 
household name. 
On autopsy, Alzheimer described the plaques and tangles in her brain that would 
go on to characterize the disease. But lost in the excitement of discovering a new 
disease, a clue may have been overlooked. He wrote, “Die größeren Hirngefäße 
sind arteriosklerotisch verändert,” which translates to “The larger cerebral vessels 
show arteriosclerotic change.” He was describing the hardening of arteries inside his 
patient’s brain.67 
We generally think of atherosclerosis as a condition of the heart, but it’s been 
described as “an omnipresent pathology that involves virtually the entire human 
organism.”68 You have blood vessels in every one of your organs, including your 
brain. The concept of “cardiogenic dementia,” first proposed in the 1970s, suggested 
that because the aging brain is highly sensitive to a lack of oxygen, lack of adequate 
blood flow may lead to cognitive decline.69 Today, we have a substantial body of 
evidence strongly associating atherosclerotic arteries with Alzheimer’s disease.70 
Autopsies have shown repeatedly that Alzheimer’s patients tend to have 
significantly more atherosclerotic plaque buildup and narrowing of the arteries 
within the brain.71,72,73 Normal resting cerebral blood flow—the amount of blood 
circulating to the brain—is typically about a quart per minute. Starting in adulthood, 
people appear to naturally lose about half a percent of blood flow per year. By age 
sixty-five, this circulating capacity could be down by as much as 20 percent.74 While 
such a drop alone may not be sufficient to impair brain function, it can put you close 
to the edge. The clogging of the arteries inside, and leading to, the brain with 
cholesterol-filled plaque can drastically reduce the amount of blood—and therefore 
oxygen—your brain receives. Supporting this theory, autopsies have demonstrated 
that Alzheimer’s patients had particularly significant arterial blockage in the arteries 
leading to the memory centers of their brains.75 In light of such findings, some experts 
have even suggested that Alzheimer’s be reclassified as a vascular disorder.76 
There are limitations to how much we can glean from autopsy studies, however. 
For example, perhaps a person’s dementia led to his or her poor diet rather than vice 
versa. To further assess the role of clogged brain arteries in the development of 
Alzheimer’s, researchers followed about four hundred people who were just starting 
to lose their mental faculties, which is called mild cognitive impairment. Special 
brain-artery scans were employed to evaluate the amount of arterial blockage in each 
patient’s brain. The researchers found that the cognition and daily functioning of 
those with the least narrowing of the arteries in their heads remained stable over the 
course of the four-year study. Meanwhile, subjects with more arterial blockage lost 
significant brain function, and those with the worst cases of plaque buildup declined 
rapidly, doubling their likelihood of progressing to full-blown Alzheimer’s. The 
researchers concluded: “An inefficient blood supply to the brain has very grave 
consequences on brain function.”77 
A study of three hundred Alzheimer’s patients found that treating vascular risk 
factors, such as high cholesterol and blood pressure, may even slow the progression 
of the disease but not stop it.78 That’s why prevention is the key. Cholesterol doesn’t 
just help generate atherosclerotic plaques within your brain arteries; it may help seed 
the amyloid plaques that riddle the brain tissue of Alzheimer’s victims.79 Cholesterol 
is a vital component of your cells, which is why your body makes all that you need. 
Consuming excess cholesterol, and especially trans and saturated fats, can raise your 
blood cholesterol level.80 Too much cholesterol in your blood is not only considered 
the primary risk factor for heart disease81 but is also unanimously recognized as a 
risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.82 
Autopsies have revealed that Alzheimer’s brains have significantly more 
cholesterol buildup than normal brains.83 We used to think that the pool of 
cholesterol in the brain was separate from the cholesterol circulating in the blood, 
but there is growing evidence to the contrary.84 Excess cholesterol in the blood can 
lead to excess cholesterol in the brain, which may then help trigger the clumping of 
amyloid seen in Alzheimer’s brains. Under an electron microscope, we can see the 
clustering of amyloid fibers on and around tiny crystals of cholesterol.85 And indeed, 
advanced brain imaging techniques, such as PET scans, have shown a direct 
correlation between the amount of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in the blood and amyloid 
buildup in the brain.86 Drug companies have hoped to capitalize on this connection to 
sell cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to prevent Alzheimer’s, but statins themselves 
can cause cognitive impairment, including short- and long-term memory loss.87 For 
people unwilling to change their diets, the benefits of statins outweigh the risks,88 but 
it’s better to lower your cholesterol levels naturally by eating healthier to help 
preserve your heart, brain, and mind. 
Genetics or Diet? 
This dietary concept may be surprising, because most of the popular press today 
treats Alzheimer’s as a genetic disease. They say it’s your genes, rather than your 
lifestyle choices, that determine whether or not you’ll succumb. However, when you 
examine the distribution of Alzheimer’s disease around the world, that argument 
begins to crumble. 
The rates of Alzheimer’s vary tenfold around the world, even taking into account 
that some populations live longer than others.89 For example, in rural Pennsylvania, if 
you knew one hundred senior citizens, it is likely that an average of nineteen of them 
would develop Alzheimer’s disease within the next decade. However, that number 
would probably be closer to just three out of one hundred if you lived in rural 
Ballabgarh, in India.90 How do we know some populations aren’t just more 
genetically susceptible? Because of migration studies, in which disease rates within 
the same ethnic group are compared between their current locale and their homeland. 
For example, the Alzheimer’s rates among Japanese men living in the United States 
are significantly higher than those of Japanese men living in Japan.91 The 
Alzheimer’s rates among Africans in Nigeria are up to four times lower than those of 
African Americans in Indianapolis.92 
Why does living in the United States increase dementia risk? 
The balance of evidence suggests that the answer lies in the American diet. Of 
course, in our new global world, you don’t have to move to the West to adopt a 
Western diet. In Japan, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s has shot up over the past few 
decades, thought to be due to the shift from a traditional rice-and-vegetable-based 
diet to one featuring triple the dairy and six times the meat. The closest correlation 
researchers found between diet and dementia was animal fat consumption; animal fat 
intake shot up nearly 600 percent between 1961 and 2008.93 A similar trend linking 
diet and dementia was found in China.94 With diets Westernizing globally, 
Alzheimer’s rates are expected to continue to increase, writes one researcher in the 
Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease , “unless dietary patterns change to those with less 
reliance on animal products.…”95 
The lowest validated rates of Alzheimer’s disease in the world are found in rural 
India,96 where people eat traditional, plant-based diets centered on grains and 
vegetables.97 In the United States, those who don’t eat meat (including poultry and 
fish) appear to cut their risk of developing dementia in half. And the longer meat is 
avoided, the lower dementia risk may fall. Compared to those eating meat more than 
four times a week, those who have eaten vegetarian diets for thirty years or more had 
three times lower risk of becoming demented.98 
Surely genetic factors play some part? They do. Back in the 1990s, scientists 
discovered a gene variant called apolipoprotein E4, or ApoE4, that makes you more 
susceptible to getting Alzheimer’s. Everyone has some form of ApoE, but about one 
in seven people have a copy of the E4 gene that is linked to the disease. It’s been 
shown that if you inherit one ApoE4 gene from your mother or father, your risk of 
getting Alzheimer’s may triple. If you get the ApoE4 gene from both parents—which 
about one in fifty people do—you might end up with nine times the risk.99 
What does the ApoE gene do? It makes the protein that’s the principal cholesterol 
carrier in the brain.100 The E4 variant may lead to an abnormal accumulation of 
cholesterol within brain cells, which could trigger Alzheimer’s pathology.101 This 
mechanism may explain the so-called Nigerian paradox. The highest frequency of the 
ApoE4 variant occurs in Nigerians,102 who surprisingly also have some of the lowest 
rates of Alzheimer’s.103 Wait a second. The population with the highest rate of the 
“Alzheimer’s gene” has one of the lowest rates of Alzheimer’s disease? This 
contradiction may be explained by Nigerians’ extremely low blood-cholesterol 
levels, thanks to a diet low in animal fat104 and consisting mainly of grains and 
vegetables.105 So, it seems, diet can trump genetics. 
Consider that in one study of a thousand people over a period of two decades, the 
presence of the ApoE4 gene, unsurprisingly, was found to more than double the odds 
of Alzheimer’s. But in those same subjects, high blood cholesterol was found to 
nearly triple the odds. The researchers suspect that controlling such risk factors as 
high blood pressure and cholesterol could substantially reduce the risk of 
Alzheimer’s, dropping the odds from up around ninefold with the dreaded, double- 
barreled ApoE4 down to just twice the risk.106 
Too often, doctors and patients have a fatalistic approach to chronic degenerative 
diseases, and Alzheimer’s is no exception.107 “It’s all in your genes,” they say, “and 
what will happen will happen.” Research shows that although you might have been 
dealt some poor genetic cards, you may be able to reshuffle the deck with diet. 
Preventing Alzheimer’s with Plant Foods 
Alzheimer’s manifests as a disease of the elderly, but like heart disease and most 
cancers, it’s a disease that may take decades to develop. At the risk of sounding like 
a broken record (or should I say an MP3 glitch?), it’s never too early to start eating 
healthier. Dietary decisions you make now may directly influence your health much 
later in life, including the health of your brain. 
Most Alzheimer’s sufferers aren’t diagnosed until they’re in their seventies,108 but 
we now know that their brains began deteriorating long before that. Based on 
thousands of autopsies, pathologists seemed to detect the first silent stages of 
Alzheimer’s disease—what appear to be tangles in the brain—in half of people by 
age fifty and even 10 percent of those in their twenties.109 The good news is that the 
clinical manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease—like heart disease, lung disease, and 
stroke—may be preventable. 
Plant-based diets are recommended in Alzheimer’s prevention guidelines because 
of which foods they tend to accentuate and which they tend to reduce.110 The 
Mediterranean diet, for example, which is higher in vegetables, beans, fruits, and 
nuts, and lower in meats and dairy products, has been associated with slower 
cognitive decline and lower risk of Alzheimer’s.111 When researchers tried to tease 
out the protective components, the critical ingredients appeared to be the diet’s high 
vegetable content and lower ratio of saturated to unsaturated fats.112 This conclusion 
aligns with that of the Harvard Women’s Health Study, which found that higher 
saturated fat intake (sourced predominantly from dairy, meat, and processed foods) 
was associated with a significantly worse trajectory of cognition and memory. 
Women with the highest saturated fat intake had a 60–70 percent greater chance of 
cognitive deterioration over time. Women with the lowest saturated fat intake had the 
brain function, on average, of women six years younger.113 
The benefits of a plant-based diet may also be due to the plants themselves. 
Whole plant foods contain thousands of compounds with antioxidant properties,114 
some of which can traverse the blood-brain barrier and may provide neuroprotective 
effects115 by defending against free radicals (see here)—that is, protecting against the 
“rusting” of the brain. Your brain is only about 2 percent of your body weight but 
may consume up to 50 percent of the oxygen you breathe, potentially releasing a 
firestorm of free radicals.116 Special antioxidant pigments in berries117 and dark- 
green leafies118 may make them the brain foods of the fruit and vegetable kingdom. 
The first human study to show that blueberries improve memory abilities in older 
adults exhibiting early cognitive deterioration was published in 2010.119 Then, in 
2012, Harvard University researchers actually quantified these findings by using data 
from the Nurses’ Health Study, in which the diets and health of sixteen thousand 
women were followed starting in 1980. They found that women who consumed at 
least one serving of blueberries and two servings of strawberries each week had 
slower rates of cognitive decline—by as much as two and a half years—compared 
with those who didn’t eat berries. These results suggest that simply eating a handful 
of berries every day, one easy and delicious dietary tweak, may slow your brain’s 
aging by more than two years.120 
Even just drinking fruit and vegetable juices may be beneficial. A study that 
followed nearly two thousand people for about eight years found that people who 
drank fruit and vegetable juices regularly appeared to have a 76 percent lower risk of 
developing Alzheimer’s disease. “Fruit and vegetable juices may play an important 
role in delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease,” the researchers concluded, 
“particularly among those who are at high risk for the disease.”121 
The researchers suspect the active ingredient may be a class of powerful brain- 
accessing antioxidants called polyphenols. If that’s the case, Concord (purple) grape 
juice may be the best choice,122 although whole fruits are generally preferable to 
juices.123 Concord grapes aren’t always in season, though, so look for cranberries, 
which are also packed with polyphenols124 and can typically be found frozen year- 
round. (Later in this book, I offer my Pink Juice recipe for a whole-food cranberry 
cocktail with twenty-five times fewer calories and at least eight times the 
phytonutrient content of store-bought cranberry “juice.” See here.) 
Beyond their antioxidant activity, polyphenols have been shown to protect nerve 
cells in vitro by inhibiting the formation of the plaques125and tangles126 that 
characterize Alzheimer’s brain pathology. In theory, they could also “pull out” 127 
metals that accumulate in certain brain areas and may play a role in the development 
of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.128 Polyphenols are one of the 
reasons I make specific recommendations for berries and green tea in part 2. 
Treating Alzheimer’s with Saffron 
Despite the billions poured into Alzheimer’s research, there is no effective treatment 
to reverse the progression of the disease. There are medications that can help manage 
the symptoms, though, and so can something found right in your grocery store. 
Although some remarkable benefits have been reported in anecdotal case studies 
with the spice turmeric,129 the best data we have on spice-based interventions for 
Alzheimer’s is for saffron. A spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, 
saffron was found in a double-blind trial to help diminish the symptoms of 
Alzheimer’s disease. In a sixteen-week study, Alzheimer’s patients with mild to 
moderate dementia who took saffron capsules displayed significantly better cognitive 
function on average than a group of patients who took a placebo.130 
How about putting saffron head-to-head against one of the most popular 
Alzheimer’s drugs on the market: donepezil (commonly marketed under the brand 
name Aricept)? A twenty-two-week double-blind study (meaning that neither the 
researchers nor the subjects knew who was on the drug and who was on the spice 
until the study’s conclusion) found that saffron appears just as effective at treating 
Alzheimer’s symptoms as the leading drug.131 Unfortunately, working just as well as 
medication isn’t saying much,132 but at least a person doesn’t have to risk the drug’s 
side effects, most typically nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.133 
While there is no proven way to halt the progression of Alzheimer’s, if you do 
know anyone suffering from the disease, regularly cooking him or her saffron-spiced 
paella may help. 
Gerontotoxins 
Each of us contains tens of billions of miles of DNA—enough for one hundred 
thousand round trips to the moon if you uncoiled each strand and placed them end to 
end.134 How do our bodies keep it from all getting tangled up? Enzymes known as 
sirtuins keep our DNA wrapped up nice and neat around spool-like proteins. 
Although they were only discovered recently, sirtuins represent one of the most 
promising areas of medicine, as they appear to be involved in promoting healthy 
aging and longevity.135 Autopsy studies show the loss of sirtuin activity is closely 
associated with the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease—namely, the accumulation of 
plaques and tangles in the brain.136 Suppression of this key host defense is 
considered a central feature of Alzheimer’s.137 The pharmaceutical industry is trying 
to come up with drugs to increase sirtuin activity, but why not just prevent its 
suppression in the first place? You may be able to do this by reducing your dietary 
exposure to advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.138 
AGE is an appropriate acronym, as they are considered “gerontotoxins,”139 
meaning aging toxins (from the Greek geros, meaning “old age,” as in “geriatric”). 
AGEs are thought to accelerate the aging process by cross-linking proteins together, 
causing tissue stiffness, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This process may play a 
role in cataract formation and macular degeneration in the eye, as well as damage to 
the bones, heart, kidneys, and liver.140 They may also impact the brain, appearing to 
accelerate the slow shrinkage of your brain as you age141 and suppressing your sirtuin 
defenses.142 
Older adults with high levels of AGEs in their blood143 or urine144 appear to 
suffer an accelerated loss of cognitive function over time. Elevated levels of AGEs 
are also found in the brains of Alzheimer’s victims.145 Where are these AGEs coming 
from? Some are produced and detoxified naturally in your body,146 but other than 
cigarette smoke,147 major sources are “meat and meat-derived products” exposed to 
dry-heat cooking methods.148 AGEs are formed primarily when fat- and protein-rich 
foods are exposed to high temperatures.149 
More than five hundred foods have been tested for AGE content, everything from 
Big Macs and Hot Pockets to coffee and Jell-O. In general, meat, cheese, and highly 
processed foods had the highest AGE content, and grains, beans, breads, vegetables, 
fruits, and milk had the least.150 
The top-twenty most AGE-contaminated products per serving tested were various 
brands of: 
  1. BBQ chicken 
  2. Bacon 
  3. Broiled hot dog 
  4. Roasted chicken thigh 
  5. Roasted chicken leg 
  6. Pan-fried steak 
  7. Oven-fried chicken breast 
  8. Deep-fried chicken breast 
  9. Stir-fried steak strips 
10. McDonald’s Chicken Selects breast strips 
11. Pan-fried turkey burger 
12. BBQ chicken 
13. Oven-fried fish 
14. McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets 
15. Broiled chicken 
16. Pan-fried turkey burger 
17. Baked chicken 
18. Pan-fried turkey burger 
19. Boiled hot dog 
20. Broiled steak151 
You get the idea. 
Yes, cooking methods matter. A baked apple has three times more AGEs than a 
raw apple, and a broiled hot dog has more than a boiled hot dog. But the source is 
what matters most: a baked apple has 45 units of AGEs compared to a raw apple’s 
13 units, while a broiled hot dog has 10,143 units compared to a boiled hot dog’s 
6,736. The researchers recommend cooking meat using moist-heat cooking methods, 
such as steaming or stewing, but even boiled fish has more than 10 times more AGEs 
than a sweet potato roasted for an hour. Meat averages about 20 times more AGEs 
than highly processed foods like breakfast cereals and about 150 times more than 
fresh fruits and vegetables. Poultry was the worst, containing about 20 percent more 
AGEs than beef. The researchers concluded that even a modest reduction in meat 
intake could realistically cut daily AGE intake in half.152 
Because sirtuin suppression is both preventable and reversible by AGE reduction, 
avoiding high-AGE foods is seen as potentially offering a new strategy to combat the 
Alzheimer’s epidemic.153 
Halting Cognitive Decline with Exercise? 
There is exciting news for people on the verge of losing their mental faculties. In a 
2010 study published in the Archives of Neurology,  researchers took a group of 
people with mild cognitive impairment—those who are starting to forget things, for 
example, or regularly repeating themselves—and had them engage in aerobic 
exercise for forty-five to sixty minutes a day, four days a week, for six months. The 
control group was instructed to simply stretch for the same time periods.154 
Memory tests were performed before and after the study. Researchers found that 
in the control (stretching) group, cognitive function continued to decline. But the 
exercising group not only didn’t get worse, they got better. The exercisers got more 
test answers correct after six months, indicating their memory had improved.155 
Subsequent studies using MRI scans found that aerobic exercise can actually 
reverse age-related shrinkage in the memory centers of the brain.156 No such effect 
was found in the stretching and toning control groups or a nonaerobic strength- 
training group.157 Aerobic exercise can help improve cerebral blood flow, improve 
memory performance, and help preserve brain tissue. 
Let’s face it: A life without memories is not much of a life. Whether those 
memories are lost all at once from a massive stroke, chipped away by ministrokes 
that leave little holes in the brain, or destroyed from within by degenerative diseases 
like Alzheimer’s, eating and living healthier can help eliminate some of the worst 
risk factors for the most serious brain diseases. 
But the key is starting early. High cholesterol and high blood pressure may begin 
hurting your brain as early as your twenties. By your sixties and seventies, when the 
damage can become apparent, it may already be too late. 
Like so many other organs, the brain possesses a miraculous ability to heal itself, 
to forge new synaptic connections around old ones, to learn and relearn. That is, 
however, if you don’t keep damaging it three times a day. A wholesome diet and 
exercise may offer your best hope for remaining sharp and healthy into your twilight 
years. 
Thankfully, I can conclude this chapter on a happier note than how it began. 
Despite our family history, both my mom and my brother, Gene, now eat a healthy, 
plant-based diet, and my mom shows no signs of succumbing to the same fate of brain 
disease that claimed the lives of her parents. Although Gene and I know that one day 
we’ll eventually lose her, given her new healthy diet, our hope is that we won’t lose 
our mom before she is gone. 
 CHAPTER 4 
How Not to Die from Digestive Cancers 
Every year, Americans lose more than five million years of life from cancers that 
may have been prevented.1 Only a small percentage of all human cancers are 
attributable to purely genetic factors. The rest involve external factors, particularly 
our diet.2 
Your skin covers about twenty square feet. Your lungs, if you were to flatten out 
all the tiny air pockets, could cover hundreds of square feet.3 And your intestines? 
Counting all the little folds, some scientists estimate that your gut would blanket 
thousands of square feet,4 vastly more expansive than your skin and lungs combined. 
What you eat may very well be your primary interface with the outside world. This 
means that regardless of the carcinogens that could be lurking in the environment, 
your greatest exposure may be through your diet. 
Three of the most common cancers of the digestive tract kill approximately one 
hundred thousand Americans each year. Colorectal (colon and rectal) cancer, which 
claims fifty thousand lives annually,5 ranks among the most commonly diagnosed of 
all cancers. Thankfully, it is also among the most treatable if caught early enough. 
Pancreatic cancer, on the other hand, is virtually a death sentence for the 
approximately forty-six thousand people who develop it every year.6 Few survive 
beyond a year after diagnosis, which means prevention is paramount. Esophageal 
cancer, which affects the tube between your mouth and stomach, is also frequently 
fatal for its eighteen thousand annual victims.7 The foods you eat can indirectly affect 
cancer risk, for example, by exacerbating acid reflux, a risk factor for esophageal 
cancer, or through direct contact with the lining of the digestive tract. 
COLORECTAL CANCER 
The average person has about a one-in-twenty chance of developing colorectal 
cancer over the course of his or her lifetime.8 Fortunately, it is among the most 
treatable cancers, as regular screening has enabled doctors to detect and remove the 
cancer before it spreads. There are more than one million colorectal cancer 
survivors in the United States alone, and, among those diagnosed before the cancer 
has spread beyond the colon, the five-year survival rate is about 90 percent.9 
But, in its early stages, colorectal cancer rarely causes symptoms. If the cancer is 
not caught until later stages, treatment is more difficult and less effective. Starting at 
age fifty until age seventy-five, you should either get stool testing every year, stool 
testing every three years plus a sigmoidoscopy every five years, or a colonoscopy 
every ten years.10 For more on the risks and benefits of these options, see chapter 15. 
While regular screenings are certainly sensible to detect colorectal cancer, 
preventing it in the first place is even better. 
Turmeric 
India’s gross domestic product (GDP) is about eight times less than that of the United 
States,11 and about 20 percent of its population lives below the poverty line,12 yet 
cancer rates in India are much lower than in the United States. Women in the United 
States may have ten times more colorectal cancer than women in India, seventeen 
times more lung cancer, nine times more endometrial cancer and melanoma, twelve 
times more kidney cancer, eight times more bladder cancer, and five times more 
breast cancer. Men in the United States appear to have eleven times more colorectal 
cancer than men in India, twenty-three times more prostate cancer, fourteen times 
more melanoma, nine times more kidney cancer, and seven times more lung and 
bladder cancer.13 Why such a discrepancy? The regular use of the spice turmeric in 
Indian cooking has been proposed as one possible explanation.14 
In chapter 2, we saw how curcumin, the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric, may 
be effective against cancer cells in vitro. Very little of the curcumin you eat gets 
absorbed into your bloodstream, however, so it may never come in sufficient contact 
with tumors outside the digestive tract.15 But what doesn’t get absorbed into your 
blood ends up in your colon, where it could impact the cells lining your large 
intestine where cancerous polyps develop. 
The emergence of colorectal cancer can be broken up into three stages. The first 
sign may be what are called “aberrant crypt foci,” or abnormal clusters of cells along 
the lining of the colon. Next come polyps that grow from that inner surface. The final 
stage is thought to occur when a benign polyp transforms into a cancerous one. The 
cancer can then eat through the wall of the colon and spread throughout the body. To 
what degree can curcumin block each stage of colorectal cancer? 
Studying smokers, who tend to have a lot of aberrant crypt foci, investigators 
found that curcumin consumption could reduce the number of those cancer-associated 
structures in their rectums up to nearly 40 percent, from eighteen down to eleven, 
within just thirty days. The only reported side effect was a yellow tint to their 
stools.16 
What if polyps have already developed? Six months of curcumin, along with 
another phytonutrient called quercetin, which is found naturally in such fruits and 
vegetables as red onions and grapes, were found to decrease the number and size of 
polyps by more than half in patients with a hereditary form of colorectal cancer. 
Again, virtually no side effects were reported.17 
What if the polyps have already transformed into cancer? In a last-ditch attempt to 
save the lives of fifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer who didn’t respond 
to any of the standard chemotherapy agents or radiation, oncologists started them on a 
turmeric extract. In the two to four months of treatment, it appeared to help stall the 
disease in one-third of the patients, five out of fifteen.18 
If we were talking about some new kind of chemotherapy drug that only helped 
one in three people, you’d have to weigh that against all the serious side effects. But 
when it’s just some plant extract shown to be remarkably safe, even if it just helped 
one in a hundred, it would be worth considering. With no serious downsides, a one- 
in-three potential benefit for end-stage cancer seems like it would spark further 
research, right? But who’s going to pay for a study of something that can’t be 
patented?19 
The low cancer rate in India may be due in part to the spices they use, but it may 
also stem from the types of foods they are putting those spices on. India is one of the 
world’s largest producers of fruits and vegetables, and only about 7 percent of the 
adult population eats meat on a daily basis. What most of the population does eat 
every day are dark-green, leafy vegetables and legumes,20 such as beans, split peas, 
chickpeas, and lentils, which are packed with another class of cancer-fighting 
compounds called phytates. 
Stool Size Matters 
The bigger and more frequent your bowel movements are, the healthier you may be. 
Based on a study of twenty-three populations across a dozen countries, the incidence 
of colon cancer appears to skyrocket as the average daily stool weight drops below 
about a half a pound. Populations dropping quarter pounders appear to have three 
times the rate of colon cancer. You can measure the weight of your stools with a 
simple bathroom scale. No, not that way—by weighing yourself before and after you 
“go.” 
The link between stool size and colon cancer may be related to “intestinal transit 
time,” the number of hours it takes for food to travel from mouth to toilet. The larger 
the stool, the quicker the transit time, as it’s easier for your intestines to move things 
along.21 People don’t realize you can have daily bowel movements and still 
effectively be constipated; what you’re flushing today you may have eaten last week. 
How long it takes food to get from one end to the other can depend on gender and 
dietary habits. Food goes through men eating plant-based diets in just a day or two, 
but this transit time takes as long as five or more days among those eating more 
conventional diets. Women eating plant-based diets also average a day or two, but 
the average intestinal transit time in most women eating conventional diets may be 
four days.22 So you can be regular but four days late. You can measure your own 
oral-anal transit time by eating some beets and noting when your stools turn pink. If 
that takes less than twenty-four to thirty-six hours, you’re probably meeting the 
healthy half-pound target.23 
Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal complaint in the United States, 
leading to millions of doctor visits each year.24 But beyond just the discomfort, the 
straining associated with trying to pass small, firm stools may play a role in a host of 
health problems, including hiatal hernia, varicose veins, hemorrhoids,25 and painful 
conditions with names like anal fissure.26 
Constipation can be considered a nutrient-deficiency disease, and that nutrient is 
fiber.27 Just as you can get scurvy if you don’t get enough vitamin C, you can get 
constipation if you don’t get enough fiber. Since fiber is found only in plant foods, 
it’s no surprise that the more plants you eat, the less likely you are to be constipated. 
For example, a study comparing thousands of omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans 
found that those eating strictly plant-based diets are three times more likely to have 
daily bowel movements.28 Looks like vegans are just regular people. 
Phytates 
Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the United 
States,29 yet in some parts of the world, it’s practically unheard of. The highest rates 
have been recorded in Connecticut, and the lowest in Kampala, Uganda.30 Why is 
colorectal cancer so much more prevalent in Western cultures? Seeking answers to 
this question, renowned surgeon Denis Burkitt spent twenty-four years in Uganda. 
Many of the Ugandan hospitals Dr. Burkitt visited had never even seen a case of 
colon cancer.31 He eventually came to the conclusion that fiber intake was the key,32 
as most Ugandans consumed diets centered around whole plant foods.33 
Subsequent research has suggested that dietary prevention of cancer may involve 
something other than just fiber. For instance, colorectal cancer rates are higher in 
Denmark than in Finland,34 yet Danes consume slightly more dietary fiber than 
Finns.35 What other protective compounds might explain the low cancer rates among 
plant-based populations? Well, fiber isn’t the only thing found in whole plant foods 
that’s missing from processed and animal-based foods. 
The answer might lie in natural compounds called phytates, which are found in the 
seeds of plants—in other words, in all whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. Phytates 
have been shown to detoxify excess iron in the body, which otherwise can generate a 
particularly harmful kind of free radical called hydroxyl radicals.36 The standard 
American diet may therefore be a double whammy when it comes to colorectal 
cancer: Meat contains the type of iron (heme) particularly associated with colorectal 
cancer37 but lacks, as do refined plant foods, the phytates to extinguish these iron- 
forged free radicals. 
For many years, phytates were maligned as inhibitors of mineral absorption, 
which is why you might have heard advice to roast, sprout, or soak your nuts to get 
rid of the phytates. In theory, this would allow you to absorb more minerals, such as 
calcium. This belief stemmed from a series of laboratory experiments on puppies 
from 1949 that suggested that phytates had a bone-softening, anticalcifying effect,38 as 
well as from subsequent studies with similar findings on rats.39 But more recently, in 
light of actual human data, phytates’ image has undergone a complete makeover. 40 
Those who eat more high-phytate foods actually tend to have a greater bone mineral 
density,41 less bone loss, and fewer hip fractures.42 Phytates appear to protect bone 
in a manner similar to that of antiosteoporosis drugs like Fosamax,43 but without the 
risk of osteonecrosis (bone rot) of the jaw, a rare, potentially disfiguring side effect 
associated with that class of drugs.44 
Phytates may also help protect against colorectal cancer. A six-year study of 
about thirty thousand Californians found that higher meat consumption was associated 
with higher risk of colon cancer. Unexpectedly, white meat appeared to be worse. 
Indeed, those who ate red meat at least once each week had about double the risk of 
developing colon cancer; that risk appeared to triple, however, for those who ate 
chicken or fish once or more a week.45 Eating beans, an excellent source of phytates, 
was found to help mediate some of that risk, so your colon cancer risk may be 
determined by your meat-to-vegetable ratio. 
There may be as much as an eightfold difference in colorectal cancer risk between 
the two extremes—high-vegetable, low-meat diets and low-vegetable, high-meat 
diets.46 So it may not be enough to just cut down on how much meat is in your diet; 
you also need to eat more plants. The National Cancer Institute’s Polyp Prevention 
Trial found that those who increased their bean consumption by even less than one- 
quarter cup a day appeared to cut their odds of precancerous colorectal polyp 
recurrence by up to 65 percent.47 
Of all the wonderful nutrients in beans, why do we credit the phytates with 
reduced risk? Petri-dish studies have shown that phytates inhibit the growth of 
virtually all human cancer cells tested so far—including cancers of the colon, breast, 
cervix, prostate, liver, pancreas, and skin48—while leaving normal cells alone.49 
This is the mark of a good anticancer agent, the ability to discriminate between tumor 
cells and normal tissue. When you eat whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, phytates 
are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and readily taken up by tumor cells. 
Tumors concentrate these compounds so efficiently that phytate scans can be used to 
trace the spread of cancer within the body.50 
Phytates target cancer cells through a combination of antioxidant, anti- 
inflammatory, and immune-enhancing activities. Besides affecting the cancer cells 
directly, phytates have been found to boost the activity of natural killer cells, which 
are white blood cells that form your first line of defense by hunting down and 
disposing of cancer cells.51 Phytates can also play a role in your last line of defense, 
which involves starving tumors of their blood supply. There are many phytonutrients 
in plant foods that can help block the formation of new blood vessels that feed 
tumors, but phytates also appear able to disrupt existing tumor supply lines.52 
Similarly, many plant compounds appear able to help slow down and even stop 
cancer cell growth,53 but phytates can sometimes also cause cancer cells to 
apparently revert back to their normal state—in other words, to stop behaving like 
cancer. This cancer cell “rehabilitation” has been demonstrated in vitro in colon 
cancer cells,54 as well as in cancer cells of the breast,55 liver,56 and prostate.57 
Phytates do have side effects, but they all appear to be good. High phytate intake 
has been associated with less heart disease, less diabetes, and fewer kidney stones. 
In fact, some researchers have suggested that phytates be considered an essential 
nutrient. Like vitamins, phytates participate in important biochemical reactions in the 
body. Your levels fluctuate with dietary intake, and insufficient consumption is 
associated with diseases that can be moderated by eating adequate amounts. Maybe 
phytates should be considered “Vitamin P.”58 
Reversing Rectal Polyps with Berries? 
There are many ways the healthfulness of different fruits and vegetables can be 
compared, such as by nutrient content or antioxidant activity. Ideally, we would use a 
measure involving actual biological activity. One way to do this is by measuring the 
suppression of cancer cell growth. Eleven common fruits were tested by dripping 
their extracts on cancer cells growing in a petri dish. The result? Berries came out on 
top.59 Organically grown berries in particular may suppress cancer cell growth better 
than those grown conventionally.60 But a laboratory is different from real life. These 
findings are only applicable if the active components of the food are absorbed into 
your system and manage to find their way to budding tumors. Colorectal cancer, 
however, grows out of the inner lining of your intestines, so what you eat may have a 
direct effect regardless. So researchers decided to give berries a try. 
Familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited form of colorectal cancer caused 
by a mutation in your tumor-suppression genes. People who are affected develop 
hundreds of polyps in their colons, some of which inevitably turn cancerous. 
Treatment can involve prophylactic colectomy, where the colon is removed early in 
life as a preventive step. There was a drug that appeared able to cause polyps to 
regress, but it was pulled from the market after it killed tens of thousands of people.61 
Could berries also cause polyps to retreat without the fatal side effects? Yes. After 
nine months of daily treatment with black raspberries, the polyp burden of fourteen 
patients with familial adenomatous polyposis was cut in half.62 
Normally, polyps would have to be surgically removed, but the berries seemed to 
have made them disappear naturally. The method by which the berries were 
administered, though, was anything but natural. The researchers used a shortcut, 
giving the berries as suppositories. Don’t try this at home! After they inserted the 
equivalent of eight pounds of raspberries into patients’ rectums over those nine 
months, some of the patients suffered from torn anuses.63 The hope is that research 
will one day show similar cancer-fighting effects of berries taken the old-fashioned 
way—through the mouth. 
Too Much Iron? 
In 2012, the results from two major Harvard University studies were published. The 
first, known as the Nurses’ Health Study, began following the diets of about 120,000 
women aged thirty to fifty-five starting back in 1976; the second, the Health 
Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed about 50,000 men aged forty to seventy- 
five. Every four years, researchers checked in with the study participants to keep 
track of their diets. By 2008, a total of about 24,000 subjects had died, including 
approximately 6,000 from heart disease and 9,000 from cancer.64 
After the results were analyzed, the researchers found that the consumption of both 
processed and unprocessed red meat was associated with an increased risk of dying 
from cancer and heart disease and shortened life spans overall. They reached this 
conclusion even after controlling for (factoring in) age, weight, alcohol consumption, 
exercise, smoking, family history, caloric intake, and even the intake of whole plant 
foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. In other words, the study subjects 
apparently weren’t dying early because they ate less of some beneficial compound 
like phytates in plants. The findings suggest there may be something harmful in the 
meat itself. 
Imagine the logistics of following more than 100,000 people for decades. Now 
imagine a study five times that size. The largest study of diet and health in history is 
the NIH-AARP study, cosponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the 
American Association of Retired Persons. Over the course of a decade, researchers 
followed about 545,000 men and women aged fifty to seventy-one in the largest study 
of meat and mortality ever conducted. The scientists came to the same conclusion as 
the Harvard researchers: Meat consumption was associated with increased risk of 
dying from cancer, dying from heart disease, and dying prematurely in general. 
Again, this was after controlling for other diet and lifestyle factors, effectively 
excluding the possibility that people who ate meat also smoked more, exercised less, 
or failed to eat their fruits and veggies.65 The accompanying editorial in the 
American Medical Association’s Archives of Internal Medicine (titled “Reducing 
Meat Consumption Has Multiple Benefits for the World’s Health”) called for a 
“major reduction in total meat intake.”66 
What does meat contain that may raise the risk of premature death? One of the 
possibilities is heme iron, the form of iron found predominantly in blood and muscle. 
Because iron can generate cancer-causing free radicals by acting as a pro-oxidant,67 
iron can be considered a double-edged sword—too little of it and you risk anemia, 
too much and you may increase risk of cancer and heart disease. 
The human body has no specific mechanism to rid itself of excess iron.68 Instead, 
humans have evolved to tightly regulate the amount of iron absorbed. If you don’t 
have enough iron circulating in your body, your intestines begin boosting iron 
absorption; if you have too much iron in circulation, your intestines decrease 
absorption. But this thermostat-like system only works effectively with the primary 
source of iron in the human diet: the nonheme iron variety found predominantly in 
plant foods. Once you have a sufficient amount of iron in your blood, your body is 
about five times more effective at blocking the absorption of excess iron from plant 
foods than from animal foods.69 This may be why heme iron is associated with 
cancer70 and heart disease risk.71 Similarly, heme iron is associated with higher risk 
of diabetes, but nonheme iron is not.72 
If we remove iron from people’s bodies, can we decrease cancer rates? Studies 
have found that people randomized to give regular blood donations to reduce their 
iron stores appear to cut their risk of getting and dying from new gut cancers by about 
half over a five-year period.73 The findings were so remarkable that an editorial in 
the Journal of the National Cancer Institute responded that “these results almost 
seem too good to be true.”74 
Donating blood is great, but we should also try to prevent the excess buildup of 
iron in the first place. The meat industry is working on coming up with additives that 
“suppress the toxic effects of heme iron,”75 but a better strategy may be to emphasize 
plant sources in your diet, which your body can better manage. 
Getting Enough Iron on a Plant-Based Diet 
Compared with people who eat meat, vegetarians tend to consume more iron (as well 
as more of most nutrients),76 but the iron in plant foods is not absorbed as efficiently 
as the heme iron in meat. While this can be an advantage in preventing iron overload, 
about one in thirty menstruating women in the United States lose more iron than they 
take in, which can lead to anemia.77 Women who eat plant-based diets do not appear 
to have higher rates of iron deficiency anemia than women who eat a lot of meat,78 
but all women of childbearing age need to ensure adequate iron intake. 
Those diagnosed with iron deficiency should talk with their doctors about first 
trying to treat it with diet, as iron supplements have been shown to increase oxidative 
stress.79 The healthiest sources of iron are whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dried 
fruits, and green, leafy vegetables. Avoid drinking tea with meals, as that can inhibit 
iron absorption. Consuming vitamin C–rich foods can improve iron absorption. The 
amount of vitamin C in a single orange can enhance iron absorption as much as three- 
to sixfold, so those trying to boost their iron absorption should reach for some fruit 
instead of a cup of tea.80 
PANCREATIC CANCER 
My grandfather died of pancreatic cancer. By the time the first symptom arose—a 
dull ache in his gut—it was too late. That’s why we need to prevent it in the first 
place. 
Pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal forms of cancer, with just 6 percent of 
patients surviving five years after diagnosis. Thankfully, it’s relatively rare, killing 
only about forty thousand Americans each year.81 As many as 20 percent of 
pancreatic cancer cases may be a result of tobacco smoking.82 Other modifiable risk 
factors include obesity and heavy alcohol consumption.83 As we’ll see, specific 
dietary factors may also play a significant role in the development of this deadly 
disease. 
For instance, how the fat in one’s diet may contribute to pancreatic cancer risk has 
long been a subject of debate. The inconsistency of research findings on the impact of 
total fat intake may be partly because different fats affect risk differently. The 
previously mentioned NIH-AARP study was large enough to be able to tease out 
what kind of fat was most associated with pancreatic cancer. It was the first to 
separate out the role of fats from plant sources, such as those found in nuts, seeds, 
avocados, and olive and vegetable oils, versus all animal sources, including meats, 
dairy products, and eggs. The consumption of fat from all animal sources was 
significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk, but no correlation was found 
with the consumption of plant fats.84 
Chicken and Pancreatic Cancer Risk 
Starting in the early 1970s, a series of laws have restricted the use of asbestos, yet 
thousands of Americans continue to die every year from exposure to it. The Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the 
Environmental Protection Agency have estimated that over a period of thirty years, 
approximately one thousand cases of cancer will occur among people exposed to 
asbestos in school buildings as children.85 
It all started generations ago with the asbestos workers. The first asbestos-related 
cancers occurred in the 1920s among miners digging up the stuff. Then came a second 
wave among shipbuilders and construction workers who used asbestos. We are now 
in the third wave of asbestos-related disease, as buildings constructed with asbestos 
are beginning to deteriorate.86 
As the history of asbestos shows, to see if something causes cancer, scientists first 
study those who have the greatest exposure to it. That’s how we’re now learning 
about the potential cancer-causing effects of poultry viruses. There has been long- 
standing concern about the possibility that wart-causing chicken cancer viruses are 
being transmitted to the general population through the handling of fresh or frozen 
chicken.87 These viruses are known to cause cancer in the birds, but their role in 
human cancers is unknown. This concern arises out of studies that show that people 
who work in poultry slaughtering and processing plants have increased risk of dying 
from certain cancers. 
The most recent, a study of thirty thousand poultry workers, was designed 
specifically to test whether “exposure to poultry cancer-causing viruses that widely 
occurs occupationally in poultry workers—not to mention the general population— 
may be associated with increased risks of deaths from liver and pancreatic cancers.” 
The study found that those who slaughter chickens have about nine times the odds of 
both pancreatic cancer and liver cancer.88 To put this result in context, the most 
carefully studied risk factor for pancreatic cancer is cigarette smoking. But even if 
you smoked for fifty years, you’d have “only” doubled your odds of getting 
pancreatic cancer.89 
What about people who eat chicken? The largest study to ever address that 
question is the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) 
study, which followed 477,000 people for about a decade. The researchers found a 
72 percent increased risk of pancreatic cancer for every fifty grams of chicken 
consumed daily.90 And that’s not much meat, under two ounces—just about a quarter 
of a chicken breast. 
The researchers expressed surprise that it was the consumption of poultry—not 
red meat—that was more closely tied to cancer. When a similar result was found for 
lymphomas and leukemias, the same EPIC research team acknowledged that while 
the growth-promoting drugs fed to chickens and turkeys could be playing a role, it 
might also be cancer viruses found in poultry.91 
The reason the connection between asbestos and cancer was comparatively easy 
to nail down is that asbestos caused a particularly unusual cancer (mesothelioma), 
which was virtually unknown before widespread asbestos use.92 But because the 
pancreatic cancer one might get from eating chicken is the same pancreatic cancer 
one might get from smoking cigarettes, it’s more difficult to tease out a cause-and- 
effect relationship. There are diseases unique to the meat industry, such as the newly 
described “salami brusher’s disease” that only affects people whose full-time job is 
to wire-brush off the white mold that naturally grows on salami.93 But most diseases 
suffered by meat industry workers are more universal. So despite the compelling 
evidence linking poultry exposure to pancreatic cancer, don’t expect an asbestos-type 
ban on Chick-fil-A anytime soon. 
Treating Pancreatic Cancer with Curry 
Pancreatic cancer is among the most aggressive forms of cancer. Untreated, most 
patients die two to four months after diagnosis. Unfortunately, only about 10 percent 
of patients appear to respond to chemotherapy, with the majority suffering severe 
side effects.94 
Curcumin, the colorful component of the spice turmeric, appears able to reverse 
precancerous changes in colon cancer and has been shown in laboratory studies to be 
effective against lung cancer cells. Similar results were obtained using pancreatic 
cancer cells.95 So why not try using curcumin to treat patients with pancreatic 
cancer? In a study funded by the National Cancer Institute and performed at the MD 
Anderson Cancer Center, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were given large 
doses of curcumin. Of the twenty-one patients the researchers were able to evaluate, 
two responded positively to the treatment. One had a 73 percent reduction in his 
tumor size, though eventually a curcumin-resistant tumor developed in its place. 
The other patient, however, showed steady improvement over the course of 
eighteen months. The only time cancer markers bumped up was during a brief three- 
week period when the curcumin therapy was halted.96 Yes, the tumors of only two out 
of twenty-one participants responded, but that’s about the same as the chemo 
regimen, and zero adverse effects were reported with the curcumin treatment. As a 
result, I’d certainly suggest curcumin to pancreatic cancer sufferers regardless of 
what other treatments they choose. Given the tragic prognosis, though, prevention is 
critical. Until we know more, your best bet is to avoid tobacco, excess alcohol 
intake, and obesity and to eat a diet low in animal products, refined grains, and added 
sugars97 and rich in beans, lentils, split peas, and dried fruit.98 
ESOPHAGEAL CANCER 
Esophageal cancer occurs when cancer cells develop in the esophagus, the muscular 
tube carrying food from your mouth to your stomach. Typically, the cancer arises in 
the lining of the esophagus and then invades the outer layers before metastasizing 
(spreading) to other organs. Early on, there may be few symptoms—if any at all. But 
as the cancer grows, swallowing difficulties can develop. 
Every year, there are about eighteen thousand new cases of esophageal cancer and 
fifteen thousand deaths.99 The primary risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol 
consumption, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, also called acid reflux), 
in which acid from the stomach gurgles up into the esophagus, burning the inner layer 
and causing inflammation that can eventually lead to cancer. Besides avoiding 
tobacco and alcohol (even light drinking appears to increase risk),100 the most 
important thing you can do to prevent esophageal cancer is to eliminate acid reflux 
disease—and that can often be accomplished through diet. 
Acid Reflux and Esophageal Cancer 
Acid reflux is one of the most common disorders of the digestive tract. The usual 
symptoms include heartburn as well as the regurgitation of stomach contents back up 
toward the throat, which can leave a sour taste in the mouth. GERD causes millions 
of doctor visits and hospitalizations each year and represents the highest annual cost 
of all digestive diseases in the United States.101 Chronic inflammation caused by acid 
reflux can lead to Barrett’s esophagus, a precancerous condition that involves 
changes in the esophageal lining.102 To prevent adenocarcinoma, the most common 
type of esophageal cancer in the United States, this sequence of events must be 
stopped—and that means halting acid reflux in the first place. 
That’s a tall order in the United States. Over the past three decades, the incidence 
of esophageal cancer in Americans has increased sixfold103—an increase greater 
than that of breast or prostate cancer, and it may be chiefly because acid reflux is on 
the rise.104 In the United States, about one in four people (28 percent) suffer at least 
weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation, compared to just 5 percent of the 
population in Asia.105 This suggests that dietary factors may play a key role. 
Over the past two decades, about forty-five studies have examined the link 
between diet, Barrett’s esophagus, and esophageal cancer. The most consistent 
association with cancer was the consumption of meat and high-fat meals.106 
Interestingly, different meats were associated with cancers in different locations. Red 
meat is strongly associated with cancer in the esophagus itself, whereas poultry was 
more strongly associated with cancer down around the stomach-esophagus border.107 
How does this happen? Within five minutes of eating fat, your sphincter muscle at 
the top of your stomach—which acts like a valve to keep down food inside the 
stomach—relaxes, allowing acids to creep back up into the esophagus.108 For 
example, in one study, volunteers consuming a high-fat meal (McDonald’s sausage, 
egg, and cheese sandwich) experienced more acid squirting up into their esophagus 
than those eating a lower-fat meal (McDonald’s hotcakes).109 Part of this effect may 
be due to the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin, which is triggered by both 
meat110 and eggs111 and may also relax the sphincter.112 This helps explain why those 
who eat meat have been found to have twice the odds of reflux-induced esophageal 
inflammation compared with vegetarians.113 
Even without the cancer risk, GERD itself can cause pain, bleeding, and scar- 
tissue narrowing of the esophagus that can interfere with swallowing. Billions of 
dollars are spent on medications to alleviate heartburn and acid reflux by reducing 
the amount of stomach acid produced, but these drugs can contribute to nutrient 
deficiencies and increase the risk of pneumonia, intestinal infections, and bone 
fractures.114 Perhaps the better strategy would be to just keep the acid in its place by 
minimizing the intake of foods that allow acid to escape. 
The protection afforded by plant-based eating may not be based just on the foods 
that are reduced, though. Centering your diet around antioxidant-rich plant foods may 
cut in half your odds of esophageal cancer.115 The most protective foods for cancer at 
the esophagus-stomach border appear to be red, orange, and dark-green leafy 
vegetables, berries, apples, and citrus fruits,116 but all unprocessed plant foods have 
the advantage of containing fiber. 
Fiber and Hiatal Hernia 
While fat intake is associated with increased risk of reflux, fiber intake appears to 
decrease that risk.117 High fiber intake may reduce the incidence of esophageal 
cancer by as much as one-third118 by helping to prevent the root cause of many cases 
of acid reflux: the herniation of part of the stomach up into the chest cavity. 
Hiatal hernia, as this condition is known, occurs when part of the stomach is 
pushed up through the diaphragm into the chest. More than one in five Americans 
suffer from hiatal hernias. In contrast, hiatal hernias are almost unheard of among 
populations whose diets are plant based, with rates closer to one in a thousand.119 
This is thought to be because they smoothly pass large, soft stools.120 
People who don’t eat an abundance of whole plant foods have smaller, firmer 
stools that can be difficult to pass. (See box here.) If you regularly strain to push out 
stool, over time the increased pressure can push part of the stomach up and out of the 
abdomen, allowing acid to flow up toward the throat.121 
This same pressure from straining on the toilet week after week can cause other 
problems. Similar to the way squeezing a stress ball causes a balloon bubble to pop 
out, the pressure from straining at the toilet may herniate outpouchings from the wall 
of the colon, a condition known as diverticulosis. The increased abdominal pressure 
may also back up blood flow in the veins around the anus, causing hemorrhoids, and 
even push blood flow back into the legs, resulting in varicose veins.122 But a fiber- 
rich diet can relieve the pressure in both directions. Those who eat diets that revolve 
around whole plant foods tend to pass such effortless bowel movements that their 
stomachs stay where they’re supposed to,123 which can reduce the acid spillover 
implicated in one of our deadliest cancers. 
Can Strawberries Reverse the Development of 
Esophageal Cancer? 
Esophageal cancer joins pancreatic cancer as one of the gravest diagnoses 
imaginable. The five-year survival rate is less than 20 percent,124 with most people 
dying within the first year after diagnosis.125 This underscores the need to prevent, 
stop, or reverse the disease process as early as possible. 
Researchers decided to put berries to the test. In a randomized clinical trial of 
powdered strawberries in patients with precancerous lesions in their esophagus, 
subjects ate one to two ounces of freeze-dried strawberries every day for six months 
—that’s the daily equivalent of about a pound of fresh strawberries.126 
All of the study participants started out with either mild or moderate precancerous 
disease, but, amazingly, the progression of the disease was reversed in about 80 
percent of the patients in the high-dose strawberry group. Most of these precancerous 
lesions either regressed from moderate to mild or disappeared entirely. Half of those 
on the high-dose strawberry treatment walked away disease-free.127 
Fiber consumption doesn’t just take off the pressure. Humans evolved eating huge 
amounts of fiber, likely in excess of one hundred grams daily.128 That’s up to about 
ten times what the average person eats today.129 Because plants don’t tend to run as 
fast as animals, the bulk of our diet used to be made up of a lot of bulk. In addition to 
keeping you regular, fiber binds to toxins, such as lead and mercury, and flushes them 
away (pun intended!).130 Our bodies were designed to expect an ever-flowing fiber 
stream, so it dumps such unwanted waste products as excess cholesterol and estrogen 
into the intestines, assuming they will be swept away. But if you aren’t constantly 
filling your bowels with plant foods, the only natural source of fiber, unwanted waste 
products can get reabsorbed and undermine your body’s attempts at detoxifying itself. 
Only 3 percent of Americans may even reach the recommended minimum daily intake 
of fiber, making it one of the most widespread nutrient deficiencies in the United 
States.131 
 CHAPTER 5 
How Not to Die from Infections 
I was still in medical school when I got a call to help defend Oprah Winfrey, who 
was being sued by a cattle rancher under a Texas food-disparagement law (thirteen 
states have so-called food-libel laws that make it illegal to make a comment that 
unfairly “implies that [a] perishable food product is not safe for consumption by the 
public”1). 
Oprah had been talking on her television show with Howard Lyman, a former 
fourth-generation cattle rancher who decried the cannibalistic feeding of cow parts to 
other cows, a risky practice blamed for the emergence and spread of mad cow 
disease. Repulsed by the thought, Oprah told the viewing audience, “It has just 
stopped me cold from eating another burger.” The next day, cattle futures tumbled, 
and the Texas cattleman claimed to have lost millions. 
My job was to help establish that Lyman’s comments were “based on reasonable 
and reliable scientific inquiry, facts, or data.”2 Despite the ease with which we did 
just that, not to mention the blatant violation of First Amendment protections inherent 
in the law, the Texas cattleman was able to tie Oprah up in a long and harrowing 
appeals process. Finally, five years later, a federal judge dismissed the case with 
prejudice, ending Oprah’s ordeal. 
In a narrow legal sense, she won. But if the meat industry is able to drag one of 
the country’s richest and most powerful people through the courts for years and cost 
her a small fortune in legal fees, what kind of chilling effect does that have on others 
who want to speak out? Now the meat industry is trying to pass so-called ag-gag 
laws, which make it illegal to take pictures inside their operations. Presumably, they 
fear people might be less inclined to buy their products if they knew how these 
products are made.3 
Thankfully, humanity dodged a bullet with mad cow disease. Nearly an entire 
generation in Britain was exposed to infected beef, but only a few hundred people 
died. We weren’t as lucky with swine flu, which the CDC estimates killed twelve 
thousand Americans.4 Nearly three-quarters of all emerging and reemerging human 
diseases arise from the animal kingdom.5 
Humanity’s dominion over animals has unleashed a veritable Pandora’s ark of 
infectious diseases. Most modern human infectious diseases were unknown before 
domestication led to a mass spillover of animal disease into human populations.6 For 
example, tuberculosis appears to have been originally acquired through the 
domestication of goats7 but now infects nearly one-third of humanity.8 Meanwhile, 
measles9 and smallpox10 may have arisen from mutant cattle viruses. We 
domesticated pigs and got whooping cough, we domesticated chickens and got 
typhoid fever, and we domesticated ducks and got influenza.11 Leprosy may have 
come from water buffalo and the cold virus from horses.12 How often did wild 
horses have the opportunity to sneeze into humans’ faces until they were broken and 
bridled? Before then, the common cold was presumably common only to them. 
Once pathogens jump the species barrier, they can then transmit person-to-person. 
HIV, a virus thought to have originated from the butchering of primates in Africa for 
the bush-meat trade,13 causes AIDS by weakening the immune system. The 
opportunistic fungal, viral, and bacterial infections AIDS patients contract—but to 
which healthy people are resistant—demonstrate the importance of baseline immune 
function. Your immune system is not just active when you’re lying in bed sick spiking 
a fever—it’s involved in a daily life-or-death struggle to save your life from the 
pathogens that surround and live inside you. 
With every breath you take, you inhale thousands of bacteria,14 and with every 
bite you eat, you can ingest millions more.15 Most of these tiny germs are completely 
harmless, but some can cause serious infectious diseases, occasionally making 
headlines with sinister-sounding names like SARS or Ebola. Although many of these 
exotic pathogens receive a lot of press coverage, more lives are lost to some of our 
most common infections. For example, such respiratory infections as influenza and 
pneumonia kill nearly fifty-seven thousand Americans each year.16 
Bear in mind that you don’t need to come in contact with a sick person to fall ill 
with an infection. There are latent infections that may exist within you, waiting to 
strike should your immune function falter. That is why it’s not enough to just wash 
your hands; you have to keep your immune system healthy. 
Protecting Others 
To protect others when you’re sick, you need to practice good respiratory etiquette 
by coughing or sneezing into the crook of your arm (into your bent elbow). This 
practice limits the dispersal of respiratory droplets and also avoids contaminating 
your hands. The Mayo Clinic has a slogan worth remembering: “The ten worst 
sources of contagion are our fingers.” When you cough into your hand, you can 
transfer contagion to everything from elevator buttons and light switches to gas 
pumps and toilet handles.17 It’s no surprise that during flu season, the influenza virus 
can be found on more than 50 percent of common household and day-care-center 
surfaces.18 
Ideally, you should sanitize your hands after every bathroom visit and handshake, 
before all food preparation, and before touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after 
coming in contact with public surfaces. The latest recommendations from the World 
Health Organization favor the use of alcohol-based sanitizing rubs or gels over hand 
washing for routine disinfection of your hands throughout the day. (Products 
containing between 60 and 80 percent alcohol were found to be more effective than 
soap in every scientific study available for review.) The only time hand washing is 
preferable is when they are dirty or visibly contaminated with bodily fluids. For 
routine decontamination—that is, for all other times—alcohol-based products are the 
preferred method for hand sanitation.19 
Still, some germs will always get past your first line of defense of practicing good 
hand hygiene. This is why you need to keep your immune system functioning at peak 
performance with a healthy diet and lifestyle. 
PREVENTING INFECTIOUS DISEASES WITH A HEALTHY 
IMMUNE SYSTEM 
The term “immune system” is derived from the Latin word immunis, meaning untaxed 
or untouched, which is fitting, given that the immune system protects the body from 
foreign invaders. Composed of various organs, white blood cells, and proteins called 
antibodies that form alliances against trespassing pathogens threatening the body, the 
immune system, apart from the nervous system, is the most complex organ system 
humans possess.20 
Your first layer of protection against intruders are physical surface barriers like 
your skin. Beneath that are white blood cells, such as neutrophils that attack and 
engulf pathogens directly, and natural killer cells that put your cells out of their 
misery if they become cancerous or infected with a virus. How do natural killer cells 
recognize pathogens and infected cells? They are often marked for destruction by 
antibodies, which are special proteins made by another type of white blood cell, 
known as B cells, that home in like smart bombs and stick to invaders. 
Each B cell makes one type of antibody that’s specific for one foreign molecular 
signature. You don’t have one B cell that covers grass pollen and another that covers 
bacteria; instead, you have a B cell whose only job is to make antibodies against the 
pollen of purple Siberian onion grass and another whose only job is to make 
antibodies against the tail proteins of bacteria that live in the thermal vents at the 
bottom of the ocean. If each of your B cells produces only one type of antibody, then 
you’d need to have a billion different types of B cells given the incredible variety of 
potential pathogens on our planet. And you do! 
Let’s suppose one day you’re walking along and suddenly get attacked by a 
platypus (they have poisonous spurs on their heels, you know). For your whole life 
up until that point, the B cell in your body that produces antibodies against duck- 
billed platypus venom was just hanging around, twiddling its thumbs, until that very 
moment. As soon as the venom is detected, this specific B cell begins dividing like 
crazy, and soon you have a whole swarm of clones each producing millions of 
antibodies against platypus poison. You fend off the toxin and live happily ever after. 
That is how the immune system works—aren’t our bodies spectacular? 
As you get older, though, your immune function declines. Is this just an inevitable 
consequence of aging? Or could it be because dietary quality also tends to go down 
in older populations? To test the theory that inadequate nutrition could help explain 
the loss in immune function as you age, researchers split eighty-three volunteers 
between sixty-five and eighty-five years old into two groups. The control group ate 
fewer than three daily servings of fruits and vegetables, while the experimental group 
consumed at least five servings a day. They were all then vaccinated against 
pneumonia, a practice recommended for all adults over the age of sixty-five.21 The 
goal of vaccination is to prime your immune system to produce antibodies against a 
specific pneumonia pathogen should you ever become exposed. Compared with the 
control group, people eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables had an 82 
percent greater protective antibody response to the vaccine—and this was after only 
a few months of eating just a few extra servings of fruits and vegetables a day.22 That 
is how much control the fork may exert over immune function. 
Certain fruits and vegetables may give the immune function an extra boost. 
Kale 
Americans eat far too little kale. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
the average American may consume about 0.05 pounds of kale each year.23 That’s 
about one and a half cups per person … per decade. 
As a dark-green, leafy vegetable, kale is not only one of the most nutrient-dense 
foods on the planet—it may also help fight off infection. Japanese researchers tried 
dripping a minute quantity of kale on human white blood cells in a petri dish, about 
one-millionth of a gram of kale protein. Even that miniscule quantity triggered a 
quintupling of antibody production in the cells.24 
The researchers used raw kale, but the scant amounts of kale Americans consume 
are often cooked. Does cooking kale destroy its immune-boosting effects? It turned 
out that even boiling the veggies nonstop for thirty minutes did not affect antibody 
production. In fact, the cooked kale appeared to work even better.25 
However, this property was discovered in a test-tube study. Even kale 
aficionados don’t mainline it like heroin, which is presumably the only way intact 
kale proteins would ever come in direct contact with our blood cells. No clinical 
studies (that is, studies on real people) on kale have been performed to date. Big 
Kale, it seems, has yet to muster the research dollars. Currently, we have stronger 
evidence for the immune benefits of kale’s less pretentious cousin, broccoli. 
Broccoli 
As I’ve mentioned, your body’s greatest exposure to the outside world is through the 
lining of your intestines, which may cover more than two thousand square feet,26 
which is about the floor area of an average house.27 But the lining is extremely thin— 
just fifty-millionths of a meter. In other words, the barrier separating your 
bloodstream from the world is many times thinner than a single sheet of tissue paper. 
This is because the body needs to absorb nutrients from food: If the gut lining were 
any thicker, nutrients would have trouble passing through. It’s a good idea for your 
skin to be waterproof so you don’t start leaking, but the lining of the gut has to allow 
for the absorption of both fluids and nutrition. With such a fragile layer between your 
sterile core and the chaos outside, you need to have a good defense mechanism in 
place to keep out the bad. 
This is where the immune system comes in, specifically a special type of white 
blood cell called intraepithelial lymphocytes. These cells serve two functions: They 
condition and repair the thin intestinal lining, and they also serve as its first line of 
gut defense against pathogens.28 These lymphocytes are covered with “Ah receptors” 
that activate the cells.29 For years, scientists couldn’t find the key that fit into the Ah 
receptor lock. If we could figure out how to activate these cells, we might be able to 
boost our immunity.30 
It turns out that key is contained in broccoli. 
You may have been taught as a kid to eat your veggies, including cruciferous ones 
like broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, and brussels sprouts. But your parents 
probably didn’t tell you why you should eat them. Now we know that this family of 
vegetables contains compounds necessary for the maintenance of the body’s intestinal 
defenses. In short, broccoli is able to rally your immune system foot soldiers.31 
Why did our immune systems evolve to depend on certain vegetables? Well, when 
do we need to boost our intestinal defenses? When we eat. The body uses up a lot of 
energy to maintain its immune system, so why remain on high alert 24-7 when we 
only eat a few times a day? Why would our bodies specifically use vegetables as the 
bat signal to assemble the troops? We evolved over millions of years eating mostly 
weeds—wild plants, including dark-green, leafy vegetables (or, as they were known 
back then, leaves)—so our bodies may have evolved to equate vegetables with 
mealtime. Vegetables’ presence in the gut works as a signal to upkeep our immune 
systems.32 So if we don’t eat plants with each meal, we may be undermining our 
bodies’ strategy to protect us. 
Interestingly, the immune boost provided by cruciferous vegetables like broccoli 
not only protects us against the pathogens found in food but also against pollutants in 
the environment. We’re all constantly being exposed to a wide range of toxic 
substances—from cigarette smoke, car exhaust, furnaces, cooked meat, fish, dairy, 
and even from mother’s milk33 (as a consequence of what the mother was exposed 
to). Because some of these pollutants, such as dioxins, exert their toxic effects 
through the Ah receptor system, cruciferous compounds may block them.34 
Other plants may also defend against toxic invaders. Researchers in Japan found 
that phytonutrients in such plant foods as fruits, vegetables, tea leaves, and beans can 
block the effects of dioxins in vitro. For instance, the researchers found that having 
phytonutrient levels in the bloodstream achieved by eating three apples a day or a 
tablespoon of red onion appeared to cut dioxin toxicity in half. The only catch was 
that these phytonutrient effects lasted only a few hours, meaning you may have to keep 
eating healthy foods, meal after meal, if you want to maintain your defenses against 
pathogens as well as pollutants.35 
The ability to block toxins isn’t limited to plant foods, however. There is one 
animal product that has also been shown to potentially block the cancer-causing 
effects of dioxins—camel urine.36 So next time your kids don’t want to eat their fruits 
and veggies, you can just say, “Hey, it’s either the broccoli or camel pee. Your 
choice.” 
Pretty in Pee-nk 
Ever noticed that your urine turns a bit pink after you eat beets? Though the color 
looks a little unnatural, it’s a completely harmless and temporary condition called 
beeturia.37 It’s a vivid reminder of an important fact: When you eat plant foods, many 
of the pigment phytonutrients that act as antioxidants in your body (such as lycopene 
and beta-carotene) are absorbed into the bloodstream and bathe your organs, tissues, 
and cells. 
In other words, beet pigments find their way into your urine because they are 
absorbed through the gut and then travel into the bloodstream, where they circulate 
throughout the body until eventually being filtered out by the kidneys. During this trip 
through the body, even your blood becomes a bit pinker too. 
The same principle causes garlic breath. It isn’t just the residue in your mouth 
that’s scaring everyone off; it’s also the health-promoting compounds that were 
absorbed into your bloodstream after you swallowed the garlic, which are then 
exhaled pungently from your lungs in your breath. Even if you just had a garlic enema, 
you’d still get garlic breath. For this reason, garlic can potentially be used as an 
adjunct treatment for critical cases of pneumonia, as it may help clear bacteria on its 
way out of the lungs.38 
Boosting Natural Killer Cell Activity with Berries 
For disease prevention, berries of all colors have “emerged as champions,” 
according to the head of the Bioactive Botanical Research Laboratory.39 The 
purported anticancer properties of berry compounds have been attributed to their 
apparent ability to counteract, reduce, and repair damage resulting from oxidative 
stress and inflammation.40 But it wasn’t known until recently that berries may also 
boost your levels of natural killer cells. 
They may sound sinister, but natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell 
that’s a vital member of the immune system’s rapid-response team against virus- 
infected and cancerous cells. They’re called natural killers because they don’t 
require prior exposure to a disease to be activated, unlike some other parts of the 
immune system that can only respond effectively after a history of exposure, as in the 
case of, say, chicken pox.41 After all, you don’t want to wait until your second tumor 
appears before your immune system starts fighting. 
There are about two billion of these elite, special-ops fighters patrolling the 
bloodstream at any one time, but research suggests that you can bolster their ranks by 
eating blueberries. In one study, researchers asked athletes to eat about a cup and a 
half of blueberries every day for six weeks to see if the berries could reduce the 
oxidative stress caused by long-distance running.42 The blueberries succeeded, 
unsurprisingly, but a more important finding was their effect on natural killer cells. 
Normally, these cells decrease in number after a bout of prolonged endurance 
exercise, dropping by half to about one billion. But the athletes consuming 
blueberries actually doubled their killer cell counts, to more than four billion. 
Blueberries can boost the number of natural killer cells, but are there any foods 
that can boost killer cell activity—that is, how effectively they fight cancer cells? 
Yes, it seems an aromatic spice called cardamom may be one. Researchers put some 
lymphoma cells in a petri dish and added natural killer cells, which were able to 
wipe out about 5 percent of the cancer cells. But after researchers effectively 
sprinkled on some cardamom, the natural killer cells became supercharged and 
eradicated even more cancer cells—up to about ten times more than without 
cardamom.43 No clinical trials have yet been done to try this out in cancer patients. 
In theory, though, cardamom-infused blueberry muffins may increase the number 
of circulating natural killer cells in the body, as well as boost their cancer-killing 
instincts. 
Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics? 
Babies delivered via cesarean section appear to be at increased risk for various 
allergic diseases, including allergic runny nose, asthma, and perhaps even food 
allergies.44 (Allergy symptoms are caused when your immune system overreacts to 
normally harmless stimuli, such as tree pollen.) Normal delivery leads to the 
colonization of the baby’s gut with the mother’s vaginal bacteria. C-section babies, 
on the other hand, are deprived of this natural exposure. The resulting difference in 
gut flora may affect the way the baby’s immune system develops, accounting for the 
difference in allergy rates. This explanation is supported by research showing that a 
disturbance in a mother’s vaginal flora during pregnancy due, for example, to 
sexually transmitted infections or douching may result in higher asthma risk for the 
infant.45 
These findings raise a broader question about the effects the good bacteria in the 
gut may have on the immune system. Some studies have shown that supplementing 
with good bacteria (probiotics) might have immunity-enhancing effects. The first such 
study demonstrated that white blood cells extracted from subjects on a probiotic 
regimen for a few weeks demonstrated a significantly enhanced ability to engulf and 
destroy potential invaders. This effect lasted for at least three weeks after the 
probiotics were discontinued. Natural killer cell activity against cancer cells in vitro 
was improved as well.46 
Improving cell function in a petri dish is nice, but do these results translate into 
fewer infections? It took another ten years before a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study was performed. (Considered the gold standard of research, 
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is a trial in which neither the 
participants nor the researchers know who is receiving an experimental treatment and 
who is receiving a placebo until the end of the study.) The study showed that people 
who take probiotic supplements may indeed have significantly fewer colds, fewer 
sick days, and fewer overall symptoms.47 The evidence to date suggests probiotics 
may reduce the risk of upper-respiratory-tract infections but is insufficient for 
recommending that people start popping probiotic pills.48 
Unless you’ve suffered a major disruption in gut flora due to a course of 
antibiotics or an intestinal infection, it may be best to focus on feeding the good 
bacteria already living in your gut.49 What do your friendly flora eat? Fiber and a 
certain type of starch concentrated in beans. These substances are called prebiotics. 
Probiotics are the good bacteria themselves, whereas prebiotics are what your good 
bacteria eat. So the best way to keep your good bacteria happy and well fed is to eat 
lots of whole plant foods. 
When you eat fresh produce, you can get both pre- and probiotics into your gut. 
Fruits and veggies are covered with millions of lactic acid bacteria, some of which 
are the same types used in probiotic supplements. When you make sauerkraut, for 
example, you don’t need to add a starter culture, because the bacteria are already 
naturally present on cabbage leaves. Including raw fruits and vegetables in your daily 
diet may therefore offer the best of both worlds.50 
Boosting the Immune System with Exercise 
What if there were a drug or supplement that could halve the number of sick days you 
take due to such upper-respiratory infections as the common cold? It would make 
some pharmaceutical company billions of dollars. But there is already something that 
can boost your immune system for free and by so much that you can achieve a 25–50 
percent reduction in sick days. And it has only good side effects. What is it? 
Exercise.51 
What’s more, it doesn’t take much of a workout to get results. Studies find that if 
you let kids run around for just six minutes, the levels of immune cells circulating in 
their blood increases by nearly 50 percent.52 At the other end of the life cycle, 
regular exercise can also help prevent age-related immune decline. One study found 
that while elderly, sedentary women have a 50 percent chance of getting an upper- 
respiratory illness during the fall season, those randomized to begin a half-hour-a- 
day walking program dropped their risk down to 20 percent. Among conditioned 
runners, though, the risk was just 8 percent.53 Exercising appeared to make their 
immune systems more than five times better at fighting infection. 
So what’s going on here? How does the simple act of moving decrease the chance 
of contracting an infection? Approximately 95 percent of all infections start in the 
mucosal (moist) surfaces, including the eyes, nostrils, and mouth.54 These surfaces 
are protected by antibodies called IgA (short for immunoglobulin, type A), which 
provide an immunological barrier by neutralizing and preventing viruses from 
penetrating into the body. The IgA in saliva, for instance, is considered the first line 
of defense against such respiratory-tract infections as pneumonia and influenza.55 
Moderate exercise may be all it takes to boost IgA levels and significantly reduce the 
chance of coming down with flu-like symptoms. Compared to a sedentary control 
group, those who performed aerobic exercises for thirty minutes three times a week 
for twelve weeks had a 50 percent increase in the levels of IgA in their saliva and 
reported significantly fewer respiratory infection symptoms.56 
While regular physical activity improves immune function and lowers respiratory 
infection risk, sustained and intense exertion may have the opposite effect. As you go 
from inactive to active, infection risk declines, but at a certain point, overtraining and 
excessive stress can increase the risk of infection by impairing immune function.57 In 
the weeks following marathons or ultramarathons, runners report a two- to sixfold 
increase in upper-respiratory-tract infections.58 Within a day of starting an 
international competition, elite soccer players were found to suffer a significant drop 
in their IgA production.59 This drop has been tied to upper-respiratory-tract 
infections during training. Other studies have found that IgA levels can drop after 
even just single bouts of overstrenuous exercise.60 
What can you do, then, if you’re a hard-core athlete? How can you reduce your 
chance of infection? Traditional sports medicine recommendations don’t appear to 
have much to offer: They’ll tell you to get a flu shot, avoid touching your eyes or 
picking your nose, and stay away from sick people.61 Gee, thanks. The reason these 
steps may be insufficient is that respiratory infections are often triggered by 
reactivations of latent viruses already inside the body, such as Epstein-Barr virus, the 
cause of mononucleosis. So even if you never came in contact with anyone else, as 
soon as your immune function dips, these dormant viruses can return and make you 
sick. 
Thankfully, a number of foods may help maintain your immunity to keep the germs 
at bay. 
First up is chlorella, a single-celled, freshwater, green algae typically sold as a 
powder or compressed into tablets. Researchers in Japan were the first to show that 
mothers given chlorella saw increased IgA concentrations in their breast milk.62 
Although chlorella extract supplements failed to boost overall immune function,63 
there is evidence that whole algae may be effective. In a study out of Japan in 2012, 
researchers rounded up athletes ripe for infection during the middle of training camp. 
Among the control group, who received no supplements, IgA levels dropped 
significantly during intense exercise. But among those who were given chlorella, IgA 
levels remained steady.64 
One note of caution: A disturbing case report from Omaha, Nebraska, was 
published recently, entitled “Chlorella-Induced Psychosis.”65 A forty-eight-year-old 
woman suffered a psychotic break two months after starting to take chlorella. Her 
physicians told her to stop it and put her on an antipsychotic drug. One week later, 
she was fine. Chlorella had never before been linked to psychosis, so they initially 
presumed it was just a fluke. In other words, the psychosis may have just 
coincidentally begun after the woman started taking chlorella, and the reason she felt 
better after stopping it may have just been due to the drug kicking in. But seven weeks 
later, she was still on the drug and had restarted taking chlorella—and she became 
psychotic again. The chlorella was stopped, and her psychosis resolved again.66 
Perhaps it wasn’t the chlorella itself that triggered the episode but some toxic 
impurity or adulteration. We don’t know. Given the scandalously ill-regulated 
supplement market, it’s hard to know what you’re getting when you try to buy “food” 
in supplement bottles. 
Another option for athletes who want to sustain their immune function is 
nutritional yeast. A 2013 study reported that you may more effectively maintain your 
levels of white blood cells after exercise by consuming a special type of fiber found 
in baker’s, brewer’s, and nutritional yeast.67 Brewer’s yeast is bitter, but nutritional 
yeast has a pleasant, cheese-like flavor. It tastes particularly good on popcorn. 
The study found that after two hours of intense cycling, the number of monocytes 
(another type of immune system white blood cell) in subjects’ bloodstreams took a 
dip. But those who were given the equivalent of about three-quarters of a teaspoon of 
nutritional yeast before they exercised ended up with even higher levels of monocytes 
than when they started working out.68 
That’s all well and good on a lab report, but does consuming yeast fiber actually 
translate to fewer illnesses? Researchers put that question to the test at the Carlsbad 
Marathon in California. 
Runners who were given the daily equivalent of about a spoonful of nutritional 
yeast in the four weeks after the race appeared to have just half the rates of upper- 
respiratory infection compared to runners consuming a placebo. Remarkably, the 
runners on yeast reported feeling better too. When asked how they felt on a scale of 
one to ten, with ten being the best, the people taking the placebo reported about a four 
or five. On the other hand, the subjects on the nutritional yeast consistently reported 
feeling better, around a six or seven. Elite athletes normally experience mood 
deterioration before and after a marathon, but this study revealed that a little 
nutritional yeast may improve a wide range of emotional states, reducing feelings of 
tenseness, fatigue, confusion, and anger, while at the same time increasing perceived 
“vigor.”69 Pass the popcorn! 
Boosting Immunity with Mushrooms 
Do you suffer from seasonal allergies? Runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing? While your 
allergies may make you feel lousy because your immune system is busily attacking 
things left and right, that same heightened state of alertness may have benefits for your 
overall health. 
Individuals suffering from allergies appear to have a decreased risk for certain 
cancers.70 Yes, your immune system might be in overdrive striking out at harmless 
things like pollen or dust, but that same overvigilance may also take down budding 
tumors in the body. It would be nice if there were a way to boost the part of the 
immune system that fights infections while down-regulating the part that results in 
chronic inflammation (and all those annoying symptoms). 
Mushrooms may just do the trick. 
Just as algae can be thought of as single-celled plants, yeast can be thought of as 
single-celled mushrooms. Thousands of edible mushrooms grow naturally, with 
worldwide annual commercial production in the millions of tons.71 But check the 
nutrition label on a carton of mushrooms and you won’t see much beyond some B 
vitamins and minerals. Is that all mushrooms have? No. What you don’t see listed is 
the array of unique myconutrients that may boost our immune function.72 
Researchers in Australia split people into two groups. One group ate its regular 
diet, while the other ate its regular diet plus a cup of cooked white button mushrooms 
every day. After just a week, the mushroom eaters showed a 50 percent boost in the 
IgA levels in their saliva. These antibody levels remained elevated for about a week 
before dropping.73 So, for sustained benefits, try to make mushrooms a steady part of 
your diet. 
But wait. If mushrooms trigger such a dramatic rise in antibody production, 
shouldn’t we be concerned they may worsen the symptoms of allergic or autoimmune 
diseases? On the contrary, it seems mushrooms may have an anti-inflammatory effect. 
In vitro studies have shown that a variety of mushrooms, including plain white button 
mushrooms, appear to blunt the inflammatory response, potentially offering a boost in 
immune and anticancer function without aggravating diseases of inflammation.74 The 
first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of its kind, 
published in 2014, confirmed an apparent antiallergy effect in children with a history 
of recurrent upper-respiratory-tract infections.75 
Food Poisoning 
Pathogens (from the Greek pathos, for “suffering,” and genes, meaning “producer 
of”) can also be found in what you eat. Foodborne illness, or food poisoning, is an 
infection caused by eating contaminated food. According to the CDC, about one in six 
Americans develops food poisoning every year. Roughly forty-eight million people 
are sickened annually—larger than the combined populations of California and 
Massachusetts. More than one hundred thousand of them are hospitalized, and 
thousands die, just because of something they ate.76 
In terms of healthy years of life lost, the top five most devastating pathogen-food 
combinations are Campylobacter and Salmonella bacteria in poultry, Toxoplasma 
parasites in pork, and Listeria bacteria in deli meats and dairy products.77 One of the 
reasons animal foods are the leading culprits is that most foodborne pathogens are 
fecal pathogens. Because plants don’t poop, the E. coli you may get from spinach 
didn’t actually originate in the spinach; E. coli is an intestinal pathogen, and spinach 
doesn’t have intestines. The application of manure to crops has been found to 
increase the odds of E. coli contamination by more than fiftyfold.78 
Eggs and Salmonella 
The single greatest public health burden in the United States in terms of food 
poisoning is Salmonella. It’s the leading cause of food poisoning–related 
hospitalizations, as well as the number-one cause of food poisoning–related death.79 
And it’s on the rise. Over the past decade, the number of cases has increased by 44 
percent, particularly among children and the elderly.80 Within twelve to seventy-two 
hours after infection, the most common symptoms appear—fever, diarrhea, and 
severe abdominal cramps.81 The illness typically lasts between four and seven days, 
but among children and the elderly, the disease can be severe enough to require 
hospitalization—or funeral arrangements. 
Many people associate Salmonella with eggs—and for good reason. In 2010, for 
instance, more than half a billion eggs were recalled due to Salmonella outbreaks.82 
However, the egg industry mantra remained: Stop whining; eggs are safe. Responding 
to cries for a recall in an op-ed published in USA Today, the chairman of the industry 
trade group United Egg Producers insisted that “completely cooked eggs are 
completely safe eggs.”83 But what exactly does “completely cooked” mean? 
The egg industry itself funded research on Salmonella and the various ways to 
cook eggs. What did they find? Salmonella in eggs can survive scrambled, over-easy, 
and sunny-side-up cooking methods. Sunny side up was found to be the riskiest. The 
industry-funded researchers bluntly concluded: “The sunny-side-up method should be 
considered unsafe.”84 In other words, even the egg industry itself knows that its 
product, prepared in a manner that millions of Americans eat on any given day all 
across the country, is unsafe. Actually, we’ve known this for some time. Twenty 
years ago, Purdue University researchers determined that Salmonella can survive in 
cooked omelets and french toast.85 Salmonella may even survive in eggs boiled up to 
eight minutes.86 
Given all of this, it should come as no surprise that, according to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), an estimated 142,000 Americans are sickened each year 
by Salmonella-tainted eggs.87 That’s an egg-borne epidemic each year in the United 
States. But eggs are “only” number ten on the worst pathogen-food combination list. 
Poultry and Salmonella 
Eating chickens, not their eggs, is actually the most common source of Salmonella 
poisoning.88 A nationwide outbreak of a particularly virulent strain of the bacteria 
was linked to our sixth-largest poultry producer, Foster Farms. It lasted from March 
2013 until July 2014.89 Why did the outbreak last so long? It was largely because the 
company continued to churn out contaminated chicken despite repeated warnings 
from the CDC.90 Though the official tally of cases numbered only in the hundreds, the 
CDC estimates that for every confirmed case of Salmonella, another thirty-eight slip 
through the cracks.91 This means Foster Farms’ chicken may have sickened more than 
ten thousand people. When U.S. Department of Agriculture officials went in to 
investigate, they found that 25 percent of the chickens they sampled were 
contaminated with the same strain of Salmonella, likely the result of fecal matter 
found on the chicken carcasses.92 
Mexico banned the importation of Foster Farms’ chicken, but in the United States, 
it remained available throughout the country.93 When a car manufacturer’s brakes 
malfunction, it announces a recall due to safety concerns. Why hasn’t Salmonella- 
tainted chicken been recalled? The U.S. Department of Agriculture once tried to shut 
down a company found to be repeatedly violating Salmonella standards. The 
company sued and won. “Because normal cooking practices for meat and poultry 
destroy the Salmonella organism,” the judges in the case concluded, “the presence of 
Salmonella in meat products does not render them ‘injurious to health.’”94 
If proper cooking kills the bug, then why do hundreds of thousands of Americans 
continue to be sickened by Salmonella-contaminated poultry every year? It’s not like 
E. coli and medium-rare hamburgers—who undercooks chicken? The problem here 
is cross-contamination. Between the time the fresh or frozen bird is picked up from 
the store and when it’s slid into the oven, the germs on the chicken can contaminate 
hands, utensils, and kitchen surfaces. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of the 
time, placing fresh chicken on a cutting board for a few minutes can transfer disease- 
causing bacteria.95 Then, if you put cooked chicken back on the same cutting board, 
there’s about a 30 percent chance that the meat will become recontaminated.96 
Foster Farms’ tone-deaf response to the outbreak may actually prove the most 
foresighted: “It is not unusual for raw poultry from any producer to have Salmonella 
bacteria,” they quoted in a press release. “Consumers must use proper preparation, 
handling and cooking practices.”97 In other words, it should be considered normal for 
chicken to be contaminated with Salmonella. Eat at your own risk. 
Why are American consumers placed at such high risk? Some European countries 
have gotten Salmonella contamination in poultry down as low as 2 percent. How? 
Because it’s illegal to sell chicken tainted with Salmonella. What a concept! They 
don’t allow the sale of fowl fouled with a pathogen that sickens more than a million 
Americans a year.98 In a meat industry trade publication, an Alabama poultry science 
professor explained why we don’t have such a “heavy-handed” policy: “The 
American consumer is not going to pay that much. It’s as simple as that.” If the 
industry had to pay to make it safer, the price would go up. “The fact,” he said, “is 
that it’s too expensive not to sell salmonella-positive chicken.”99 
Fecal Bacteria on Meat 
The contamination problem extends far beyond a single poultry producer. In a 2014 
issue of Consumer Reports, researchers published a study on the true cost of cheap 
chicken. They discovered that 97 percent of chicken breasts found in retail stores 
were contaminated with bacteria that could make people sick.100 Thirty-eight percent 
of the Salmonella they found was resistant to multiple antibiotics; the CDC considers 
such pathogens to be a serious public health threat.101 
As the Mayo Clinic rather indelicately put it, “Most people are infected with 
Salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by feces.”102 How does it 
get there? In slaughter plants, birds are typically gutted by a metal hook, which too 
often punctures their intestines and can expel feces onto the flesh itself. According to 
the latest national FDA retail-meat survey, about 90 percent of retail chicken showed 
evidence of contamination with fecal matter.103 
Using the presence of bugs like E. faecalis and E. faecium as markers of fecal 
contamination, 90 percent of chicken parts, 91 percent of ground turkey, 88 percent of 
ground beef, and 80 percent of pork chops are tainted on the retail level nationally.104 
While outbreaks of Salmonella infection have increased, E. coli infection from 
fecal matter in beef has decreased.105 Why is beef getting safer but chicken getting 
riskier?106 One likely factor is that the government was able to enact a ban on the sale 
of beef contaminated with a particularly dangerous strain of E. coli. But why is it 
illegal to sell beef known to be contaminated with a potentially deadly pathogen but 
perfectly legal to sell contaminated chicken? After all, Salmonella in chicken kills 
far more people than E. coli in beef.107 
The problem dates back to a famous case in 1974 when the American Public 
Health Association sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for putting its stamp of 
approval on meat contaminated with Salmonella. Defending the meat industry, the 
USDA pointed out that because “there are numerous sources of contamination which 
might contribute to the overall problem,” it would be “unjustified to single out the 
meat industry and ask that the [USDA] require it to identify its raw products as being 
hazardous to health.”108 In other words, because Salmonella has also been linked to 
dairy and eggs, it wouldn’t be fair to force only the meat industry to make their 
products safer. That’s like the tuna industry arguing there’s no need to label cans of 
tuna with mercury warnings because you could also get exposed by eating a 
thermometer. 
The Washington, D.C., Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the meat industry’s 
position, asserting that the USDA can allow potentially deadly Salmonella in meat 
because “American housewives and cooks normally are not ignorant or stupid and 
their methods of preparing and cooking of food do not ordinarily result in 
salmonellosis.”109 That’s like saying minivans don’t need airbags or seat belts, and 
kids don’t need car seats, because soccer moms don’t ordinarily crash into things. 
Avoiding Chicken to Avoid Urinary Tract Infections 
Where do bladder infections come from? Back in the 1970s, studies of women over 
time found that movement of bacteria from the rectum into the vaginal area preceded 
the appearance of bladder infections.110 It took another twenty-five years, though, 
before DNA fingerprinting techniques proved that E. coli strains residing in the gut 
serve as the reservoir for urinary tract infections (UTIs).111 
Another fifteen years passed before scientists tracked down the ultimate culprit, 
the original source of some of the UTI-associated bacteria in the rectum: chicken. 
McGill University researchers were able to capture UTI-causing E. coli at the 
slaughter plants, tracing them to the meat supply and, eventually, to urinary specimens 
obtained from infected women.112 As a result, we now have direct proof that bladder 
infections can be a zoonosis—an animal-to-human disease.113 This is a critical 
discovery, since UTIs affect more than ten million women each year in the United 
States at the cost of more than $1 billion.114 Even worse, it turns out that many of the 
strains of E. coli in chicken that cause UTIs are now resistant to some of our most 
powerful antibiotics.115 
Can’t we solve this crisis by simply distributing meat thermometers and making 
sure people cook chicken thoroughly? No—because of the cross-contamination issue. 
Studies have shown that handling raw chicken can lead to intestinal colonization even 
if you don’t eat any of it.116 In that case, it doesn’t matter how well you cook your 
chicken. You could incinerate it to ash and still walk away infected. After infection, 
the drug-resistant chicken bacteria was then found to multiply to the point of 
becoming a major part of the research subject’s gut flora.117 
The reason most people have more fecal bacteria in their kitchen sinks than their 
toilet seats118 is likely because they prepare their chickens in the kitchen, not the 
bathroom. But what if you’re really careful? A landmark study, published as “The 
Effectiveness of Hygiene Procedures for Prevention of Cross-Contamination from 
Chicken Carcasses in the Domestic Kitchen,” put this question to the test. 
Researchers visited five dozen homes, gave each family a raw chicken, and asked 
them to cook it. After the bird was cooked, researchers returned to find bacteria from 
chicken feces—Salmonella and Campylobacter, both serious human pathogens—all 
over the families’ kitchens: on the cutting board, utensils, cupboard, the refrigerator 
handle, the oven handle, the doorknob, and so on.119 
Obviously, people didn’t know what they were doing, so the researchers then 
repeated the experiment, but this time gave the families specific instructions. After 
they cooked the chicken, the subjects were told to wash these surfaces with hot water 
and detergent, specifically the cutting board, utensils, cupboard, handles, and knobs. 
Yet the researchers still found pathogenic fecal bacteria all over.120 
Reading the study, you could tell the researchers were getting a bit exasperated. 
Finally, they insisted the subjects use bleach. The dishcloth used to clean up was to 
first be immersed in bleach disinfectant, and then the subjects were to spray a bleach 
solution on all surfaces and let it sit for five minutes. However, the researchers 
returned to still find Salmonella and Campylobacter on some utensils, a dishcloth, 
the counter around the sink, and the cupboards.121 The extent of the kitchen 
contamination was much less, but still, it appears that unless you treat your kitchen 
like a biohazard laboratory, the only way to guarantee you’re not going to leave fecal 
pathogens around the kitchen is to not bring them into your house in the first place. 
There is some good news: It’s not as if you eat chicken once and your gut is 
colonized for life. In the study in which volunteers became infected after just 
handling the meat, the chicken bacteria that tried to take over their gut only seemed to 
last about ten days.122 The good bacteria in their guts seemed able to muscle the bad 
guys out of the way. The problem, unfortunately, is that people tend to eat chicken 
more than once every ten days, so they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken 
bugs into their systems. 
Yersinia in Pork 
Nearly one hundred thousand Americans are sickened each year by Yersinia 
bacteria.123 In every outbreak for which a source has been found, the culprit was 
contaminated pork.124 
In most cases, Yersinia food poisoning leads to little more than acute 
gastroenteritis, but the symptoms can become severe and mirror appendicitis, 
resulting in unnecessary emergency surgeries.125 Long-term consequences of Yersinia 
infection include chronic inflammation of the eyes, kidneys, heart, and joints.126 
Studies have found that within a year of contracting Yersinia food poisoning, victims 
appear forty-seven times more likely to come down with autoimmune arthritis,127 and 
the bacteria may also play a role in triggering an autoimmune thyroid condition 
known as Graves’ disease.128 
How contaminated are U.S. pork products? Consumer Reports magazine tested 
nearly two hundred samples from cities across the country and found that more than 
two-thirds of the pork was contaminated with Yersinia.129 This may be because of the 
intensification and overcrowding that characterizes most of today’s industrial pig 
operations.130 As noted in an article in National Hog Farmer entitled “Crowding 
Pigs Pays,” pork producers can maximize their profits by confining each pig to a six- 
square-foot space. This basically means cramming a two-hundred-pound animal into 
an area equivalent to about two feet by three feet. The authors acknowledged that 
overcrowding presents problems, including inadequate ventilation and increased 
health risks, but they concluded that sometimes, “crowding pigs a little tighter will 
make you more money.”131 
Unfortunately, this situation is not expected to change anytime soon. Why? 
Yersinia bacteria do not cause clinical disease in pigs.132 In other words, it’s a 
public health problem, not an animal production problem. It doesn’t affect the 
industry’s bottom line. So instead of giving these animals a little more breathing 
room, the pork industry just largely passes along to society the estimated $250 
million cost of sickening tens of thousands of Americans every year.133 
C. Difficile Superbugs in Meat 
There’s a new superbug in town: Clostridium difficile. C. diff, as it’s commonly 
known, is one of our most urgent bacterial threats, infecting an estimated quarter- 
million Americans annually and killing thousands at a cost of $1 billion a year.134 It 
causes a condition called pseudomembranous colitis, which manifests as painful, 
crampy diarrhea. C. diff has traditionally been considered a hospital-acquired 
infection—something you pick up in health care settings—but it was recently 
discovered that only about one-third of C. diff cases can be linked to contact with an 
infected patient.135 What’s going on? 
Well, another source of infection may be meat. The CDC found that 42 percent of 
packaged meat products sold at three national chain grocery stores sampled 
contained toxin-producing C. diff bacteria.136 The United States, it turns out, has the 
highest reported levels of C. diff meat contamination in the world.137 
C. diff has also been found in chicken, turkey, and beef, but pork contamination 
has received the greatest attention from health officials, as it most closely matches the 
same strain found in non-hospital-related human infections.138 Since 2000, C. diff has 
increasingly been reported as one of the leading causes of intestinal infections among 
baby piglets.139 Carcass contamination with this diarrheal pathogen at the time of 
slaughter is considered the most likely source of the contamination of retail pork.140 
Normally, C. diff won’t do anything to you. Even if it gets into your gut, your good 
bacteria can usually muscle it into submission. It can lie in wait, though, until the 
good guys are out of the way. The next time you have to take an antibiotic that 
disrupts your normal gut flora, C. diff can rear its ugly head and cause a range of 
inflammatory bowel conditions, including a life-threatening condition that’s as bad as 
it sounds: toxic megacolon.141 (It carries a mortality rate as high as a flip of a 
coin.)142 
Doesn’t cooking wipe out most bugs? Well, C. diff isn’t like most bugs. For most 
meat, 71 degrees Celsius is the recommended internal cooking temperature. But C. 
diff can survive two hours of cooking at that temperature.143 In other words, you 
could grill chicken at the recommended cooking thermometer temperature for two 
hours straight and still not kill the bug. 
You’ve probably seen advertisements for those alcohol-based hand sanitizers that 
advertise they kill 99.99 percent of all germs. Well, C. diff falls into that 0.01 
percent. They don’t call it a superbug for nothing. Residual spores of the pathogen 
have been shown to be readily transmitted with a handshake even after using hand 
sanitizer.144 As one of the lead researchers who discovered another superbug in the 
U.S. meat supply, MRSA,145 has advised,146 people who handle raw meat may want 
to wear gloves. 
Facing a Post-Antibiotic Age 
Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, recently 
warned that we may be facing a future in which many of our miracle drugs no longer 
work. She stated, “A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine 
as we know it. Things as common as strep throat or a child’s scratched knee could 
once again kill.”147 We may soon be past the age of miracles. 
The director-general’s prescription to avoid this catastrophe included a global 
call to “restrict the use of antibiotics in food production to therapeutic purposes.” In 
other words, only use antibiotics in agriculture to treat sick animals. But that isn’t 
happening. In the United States, meat producers feed millions of pounds of antibiotics 
each year to farm animals just to promote growth or prevent disease in the often 
cramped, stressful, and unhygienic conditions of industrial animal agriculture. Yes, 
physicians overprescribe antibiotics as well, but the FDA estimates that 80 percent 
of the antimicrobial drugs sold in the United States every year now go to the meat 
industry.148 
Antibiotic residues can then end up in the meat you eat. Studies have revealed that 
traces of such antibiotics as Bactrim, Cipro, and Enrofloxacin have been found in the 
urine of people eating meat—even though none of them was taking those drugs. The 
researchers concluded: “Consumption amounts of beef, pork, chicken, and dairy 
products could explain the daily excretion amount of several antibiotics in urine.”149 
These antibiotic levels can be lowered, however, after merely five days of removing 
meat from the diet.150 
Nearly every major medical and public health institution has come out against the 
dangerous practice of feeding antibiotics to farm animals by the ton just to fatten them 
faster.151 Yet the combined political might of agribusiness and the pharmaceutical 
industries that profit from the sales of these drugs has effectively thwarted any 
effective legislative or regulatory action, all to save the industry less than a penny per 
pound of meat.152 
Healthy living may help protect you against both airborne and foodborne 
illnesses. Eating more fruits and vegetables and exercising more frequently can boost 
your immune system to help you fight off respiratory infections like the common cold. 
And sticking to mostly plant foods can help prevent you from becoming another food 
poisoning statistic by reducing your exposure to some of the deadliest fecal 
pathogens.

Six years after I helped defend Oprah against her meat-defamation lawsuit, I received 
my own legal threat. The Atkins corporation accused me of “defamatory” statements 
in my book Carbophobia: The Scary Truth About America’s Low-Carb Craze. Their 
lawyer claimed my words “continue to harm Atkins’ reputation and cause injury to 
Atkins.” My book certainly couldn’t have caused more injury to Dr. Atkins than his 
own diet. You see, he died the year before, overweight and—according to his 
autopsy report—suffering from a history of heart attack, congestive heart failure, and 
hypertension.153 
However, the lawyers were talking about damage to Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. 
Rather than let them shut me up, I posted their legal threat online with a point-by- 
point rebuttal.154 Thankfully, under the law, the truth is considered an absolute 
defense against defamation. 
Atkins’s attorneys never made good on their threat. Within four months of my 
book’s publication, the Atkins corporation filed for bankruptcy. 
 CHAPTER 6 
How Not to Die from Diabetes 
A few years ago, Millan, a member of the NutritionFacts.org community, was kind 
enough to share her story with me. When she was thirty years old, she was diagnosed 
with type 2 diabetes. Millan had struggled with obesity all her life and suffered 
through the highs and lows of years of yo-yo dieting. She had tried nearly every fad 
diet she could find but, not surprisingly, would quickly gain back whatever weight 
she’d lost. Diabetes wasn’t a stranger to her. Millan’s parents, brothers, and aunt 
were all diabetic, so she figured that her own diagnosis was inevitable. It’s age 
related. It’s genetic. There was nothing she could do. Or so she thought. 
Millan’s initial diagnosis was back in 1970, and she lived as a diabetic for two 
decades. Then, in the 1990s, she switched to an entirely plant-based diet and 
completely turned her life around. Today, her energy levels are better than ever, she 
looks and feels younger, and she’s finally been able to maintain a healthy weight. 
More than four decades after being diagnosed as a diabetic, Millan, now in her 
seventies, is fit as a fiddle. She even teaches high-intensity Zumba classes! She didn’t 
find some wonder drug or trademarked diet. She simply decided to eat healthier 
food. 
*   *   * 
The disease called diabetes mellitus comes from two words: diabetes (Greek for “to 
pass through or siphon”) and mellitus (Latin for “honey sweet”). Diabetes mellitus is 
characterized by chronically elevated levels of sugar in your blood. This is because 
either your pancreas gland isn’t making enough insulin (the hormone that keeps your 
blood sugar in check) or because your body becomes resistant to insulin’s effects. 
The insulin-deficiency disease is called type 1 diabetes, and the insulin-resistance 
disease is called type 2 diabetes. If too much sugar builds up in your blood, it can 
overwhelm the kidneys and spill into your urine. 
How did people test urine before they had modern laboratory techniques? They 
tasted it. Diabetic urine can evidently taste as sweet as honey. Hence the name. 
Type 2 diabetes has been called the “Black Death of the twenty-first century” in 
terms of its exponential spread around the world and its devastating health impacts. 
Instead of the bubonic plague, though, the pathological agents in obesity and type 2 
diabetes are identified as “high-fat and high-calorie diets,” and instead of fleas and 
rodents, the causes are “advertisements and inducements to poor lifestyle.”1 More 
than twenty million Americans are currently diagnosed with diabetes, a tripling of 
cases since 1990.2 At this rate, the CDC predicts that one in three Americans will be 
diabetic by midcentury.3 Currently in the United States, diabetes causes about 50,000 
cases of kidney failure, 75,000 lower extremity amputations, 650,000 cases of vision 
loss,4 and about 75,000 deaths every year.5 
Your digestive system breaks down the carbohydrates you eat into a simple sugar 
called glucose, which is the primary fuel powering all the cells in your body. To get 
from the bloodstream into your cells, glucose requires insulin. Think of insulin as the 
key that unlocks the doors to your cells to allow glucose to enter. Every time you eat 
a meal, insulin is released by your pancreas to help shuttle the glucose into your 
cells. Without insulin, your cells can’t accept glucose, and, as a result, the glucose 
builds up in your blood. Over time, this extra sugar can damage the blood vessels 
throughout the body. That’s why diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart 
attacks, and stroke. High blood sugar can also damage your nerves, creating a 
condition known as neuropathy that can cause numbness, tingling, and pain. Because 
of the damage to their blood vessels and nerves, diabetics may also suffer from poor 
circulation and lack of feeling in the legs and feet, which can lead to poorly healing 
injuries that can, in turn, end as amputations. 
Type 1 diabetes, previously called juvenile-onset diabetes, represents 
approximately 5 percent of all diagnosed diabetes cases.6 In most people with type 1 
diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in 
the pancreas. Without insulin, blood sugar rises to unsafe levels. Type 1 diabetes is 
therefore treated with injections of insulin, a type of hormone-replacement therapy, to 
make up for the lack of production. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, 
though a genetic predisposition combined with exposure to such environmental 
triggers as viral infection and/or cow’s milk may play a role.7 
Type 2 diabetes, previously known as adult-onset diabetes, accounts for 90–95 
percent of diabetes cases.8 In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas can make insulin, but it 
doesn’t work as well. The accumulation of fat inside the cells of your muscles and 
liver interferes with the action of insulin.9 If insulin is the key that unlocks the doors 
to your cells, saturated fat is what appears to gum up the locks. With glucose denied 
entry into your muscles, the primary consumer of such fuel, sugar levels can rise to 
damaging levels in your blood. The fat inside these muscle cells can come from the 
fat you eat or the fat you wear (i.e., your body fat). The prevention, treatment, and 
reversal of type 2 diabetes therefore depends on diet and lifestyle. 
The CDC estimates that more than twenty-nine million Americans are living with 
diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes—that’s about 9 percent of the U.S. population. 
Out of one hundred people you know, chances are six of them already know they are 
diabetic and about three have diabetes but haven’t yet been diagnosed. More than one 
million new cases of type 2 diabetes are diagnosed each year.10 
The good news: Type 2 diabetes is almost always preventable, often treatable, 
and sometimes even reversible through diet and lifestyle changes. Like other leading 
killers—especially heart disease and high blood pressure—type 2 diabetes is an 
unfortunate consequence of your dietary choices. But even if you already have 
diabetes and its complications, there is hope. Through lifestyle changes, you may be 
able to achieve a complete remission of type 2 diabetes, even if you’ve been 
suffering with the disease for decades. In fact, by switching to a healthy diet, you can 
start improving your health within a matter of hours. 
What Causes Insulin Resistance? 
The hallmark of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance in your muscles. As we’ve 
learned, insulin normally enables blood sugar to enter the cells, but when the cells 
are resistant and don’t respond to insulin as they should, it can lead to dangerous 
levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream. 
What causes insulin resistance in the first place? 
Studies dating back nearly a century note a striking finding. In 1927, researchers 
divided healthy young medical students into multiple groups to test out the effects of 
different diets. Some were given a fat-rich diet composed of olive oil, butter, egg 
yolks, and cream; others were given a carbohydrate-rich diet of sugar, candy, pastry, 
white bread, baked potatoes, syrup, bananas, rice, and oatmeal. Surprisingly, insulin 
resistance skyrocketed in the fat-rich diet group; within a matter of days, their blood 
sugar levels doubled in response to a sugar challenge, far more than those on the 
sugar and starch diet.11 It took scientists another seven decades to unravel the mystery 
of why this happened, but the answer would provide the key to what causes type 2 
diabetes. 
To understand the role of diet, we must first understand how the body stores fuel. 
When athletes talk about “carb loading” before a competition, they’re referring to the 
need to build a fuel supply in their muscles. Carb loading is a more extreme version 
of what you do every day: Your digestive system breaks down the starch you eat into 
glucose, which enters your circulatory system as blood sugar and is then stored in 
your muscles to be used for energy as needed. 
Blood sugar, though, is a little like a vampire: It needs an invitation to come into 
your cells. And that invitation is insulin, the key that unlocks the front door of your 
muscle cells so glucose can enter. When insulin attaches to insulin receptors on a 
cell, it activates a series of enzymes that escort in the glucose. Without insulin, blood 
glucose is stuck out in the bloodstream, banging on your cells’ front door, unable to 
enter. Blood sugar levels then rise, damaging vital organs in the process. In type 1 
diabetes, the body destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, so very 
little insulin is present to let blood sugar enter your cells. But with type 2 diabetes, 
insulin production isn’t the problem. The key is there, but something has gummed up 
the lock. This is called insulin resistance. Your muscle cells become resistant to the 
effect of insulin. 
So what’s jamming up the door locks on your muscle cells, preventing insulin 
from letting glucose enter? Fat—more specifically, intramyocellular lipid, the fat 
inside your muscle cells. 
Fat in your bloodstream, either from your own fat stores or from your diet, can 
build up inside your muscle cells, where it can create toxic breakdown products and 
free radicals that block the insulin-signaling process.12 No matter how much insulin 
you produce, your fat-compromised muscle cells can’t effectively use it. 
This mechanism by which fat interferes with insulin function has been 
demonstrated by either infusing fat into people’s bloodstreams and watching insulin 
resistance shoot up13 or by removing fat from people’s blood and seeing insulin 
resistance drop.14 We can now even visualize the amount of fat in the muscles using 
MRI technology.15 Researchers are now able to track the fat going from the blood 
into the muscles and watch insulin resistance rise.16 One hit of fat, and within 160 
minutes, the absorption of glucose into your cells becomes compromised.17 
Researchers don’t have to give their study subjects fat through an IV, though. All 
they have to do is feed them. 
Even among healthy individuals, a high-fat diet can impair the body’s ability to 
handle sugar. But you can lower your insulin resistance by lowering your fat intake. 
Research has clearly shown that as the amount of fat in your diet becomes 
increasingly lower, insulin works increasingly better.18 Unfortunately, given the 
current diets of American children, we’re seeing both obesity and type 2 diabetes 
occur earlier and earlier in life. 
Prediabetes in Children 
Prediabetes is defined by elevated blood sugar levels that are not yet high enough to 
reach the official diabetes threshold. Commonly found among those who are 
overweight and obese, in the past, prediabetes was regarded as a high-risk state that 
presaged diabetes, but it was not thought to be a disease in itself. However, we now 
know that prediabetic individuals may already be experiencing organ damage. 
Prediabetics may already have sugar damage to their kidneys, eyes, blood 
vessels, and nerves even before diabetes is diagnosed.19 Evidence from numerous 
studies suggests that chronic complications of type 2 diabetes begin occurring during 
the prediabetic state.20 To prevent diabetic damage, therefore, we need to prevent 
prediabetes—and the earlier, the better. 
Thirty years ago, virtually all diabetes in children was assumed to be type 1. But 
since the mid-1990s, we’ve started to see an increase in type 2 diabetes among 
kids.21 What was once called “adult-onset diabetes” is now known as type 2 diabetes 
because children as young as eight are developing the disease.22 This trend can have 
devastating consequences: A fifteen-year follow-up study of children who were 
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes found an alarming prevalence of blindness, 
amputation, kidney failure, and death by the time these kids had reached young 
adulthood.23 
Why the dramatic rise in childhood diabetes? It’s likely due to the dramatic rise in 
childhood obesity.24 Over recent decades, the number of American children 
considered to be overweight has increased by more than 100 percent.25 Children who 
are obese at age six are more likely than not to stay that way, and 75–80 percent of 
obese adolescents will remain obese as adults.26 
Childhood obesity is a powerful predictor of adult disease and death. For 
example, being overweight as a teenager was found to predict disease risk fifty-five 
years later. Such individuals may end up with twice the risk of dying from heart 
disease and a higher incidence of other diseases, including colorectal cancer, gout, 
and arthritis. Researchers have found that being overweight as a teen could be an 
even more powerful predictor of disease risk than being overweight as an adult.27 
To prevent childhood diabetes, we need to prevent childhood obesity. How do 
we do that? 
In 2010, the chair of the nutrition department at Loma Linda University published 
a paper suggesting that giving up meat entirely is an effective way to combat 
childhood obesity, pointing to population studies demonstrating that people eating 
plant-based diets are consistently thinner than those who eat meat.28 
To study body weight, we usually rely on body mass index (BMI), which is a 
measure of weight that also takes height into account. For adults, a BMI over 30 is 
considered obese. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight, and a BMI 
between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered “ideal weight.” In the medical profession, we 
used to call a BMI of under 25 “normal weight.” Sadly, that’s no longer normal. 
What’s your BMI? Visit one of the scores of online BMI calculators or grab a 
calculator and multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Then divide that twice by your 
height in inches. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds and are 71 inches tall (five 
foot eleven), that would be (200 × 703) ÷ 71 ÷ 71 = 27.9, a BMI indicating that you 
would be, unfortunately, significantly overweight. 
The largest study ever to compare the obesity rates of those eating plant-based 
diets was published in North America. Meat eaters topped the charts with an average 
BMI of 28.8—close to being obese. Flexitarians (people who ate meat more on a 
weekly basis rather than daily) did better at a BMI of 27.3, but were still overweight. 
With a BMI of 26.3, pesco-vegetarians (people who avoid all meat except fish) did 
better still. Even U.S. vegetarians tend to be marginally overweight, coming in at 
25.7. The only dietary group found to be of ideal weight were the vegans, whose 
BMI averaged 23.6.29 
So why aren’t more parents feeding their kids plant-based diets? There’s a 
common misconception in America that their growth will be stunted. However, the 
opposite may be true. Loma Linda University researchers found that children who eat 
vegetarian diets not only grow up leaner than kids who eat meat but taller, too, by 
about an inch.30 In contrast, meat intake is associated more with horizontal growth: 
The same researchers found a strong link between consumption of animal foods and 
increased risk of being overweight.31 
Developing diabetes in childhood appears to cut life expectancy by about twenty 
years.32 Who among us wouldn’t go to the ends of the earth to enable our kids to live 
two decades longer? 
THE FAT YOU EAT AND THE FAT YOU WEAR 
Carrying excess body fat is the number-one risk factor for type 2 diabetes; up to 90 
percent of those who develop the disease are overweight.33 What’s the connection? 
In part, a phenomenon known as the spillover effect. 
Interestingly, the number of individual fat cells in your body doesn’t change much 
in adulthood, no matter how much weight you gain or lose. They just swell up with 
fat as the body gains weight, so when your belly gets bigger, you’re not necessarily 
creating new fat cells; rather, you’re just cramming more fat into existing ones.34 In 
overweight and obese people, these cells can get so bloated that they actually spill 
fat back into the bloodstream, potentially causing the same clogging of insulin 
signaling one would experience from eating a fatty meal. 
Doctors can actually measure the level of freely floating fat in the bloodstream. 
Normally, it’s between about one hundred and five hundred micromoles per liter. But 
people who are obese have blood levels between roughly six hundred and eight 
hundred. People eating low-carb, high-fat diets can reach the same elevated levels. 
Even a trim person eating a high-fat diet can average eight hundred, so that sky-high 
number isn’t exclusive to obese patients. Because those eating high-fat diets are 
absorbing so much fat into their bloodstreams from their digestive tract, the level of 
free fat in their blood is as high as someone who’s grossly obese.35 
Similarly, being obese can be like gorging on bacon and butter all day even if you 
are actually eating healthfully. That’s because an obese person’s body may be 
constantly spilling fat into the bloodstream, regardless of what goes into the mouth. 
No matter the source of fat in your blood, as fat levels rise, your ability to clear 
sugar from the blood drops due to insulin resistance—the cause of type 2 diabetes. 
People who eat a plant-based diet, on the other hand, have just a small fraction of 
the rate of diabetes seen in those who regularly eat meat. As you can see in figure 1, 
as diets become increasingly plant based, there appears to be a stepwise drop in 
diabetes rates.36 Based on a study of eighty-nine thousand Californians, flexitarians 
appear to cut their rate of diabetes by 28 percent, good news for those who eat meat 
maybe once a week rather than every day. Those who cut out all meat except fish 
appear to cut their rates in half. What about those eliminating all meat, including fish? 
They appear to eliminate 61 percent of their risk. And those who go a step farther and 
drop eggs and dairy foods too? They may drop their diabetes rates 78 percent 
compared with people who eat meat on a daily basis. 
Why would this be? 
Figure 1 
Is it just because people eating plant-based diets are better able to control their 
weight? Not entirely. Even at the same weight as regular omnivores, vegans appear 
to have less than half the risk of diabetes.37 The explanation may lie in the difference 
between plant fats and animal fats. 
Saturated Fat and Diabetes 
Not all fats affect our muscle cells in the same way. For example, palmitate, the kind 
of saturated fat found mostly in meat, dairy, and eggs, causes insulin resistance. On 
the other hand, oleate, the monounsaturated fat found mostly in nuts, olives, and 
avocados, may actually protect against the detrimental effects of the saturated fat.38 
Saturated fats can wreak all sorts of havoc in muscle cells and may result in the 
accumulation of more toxic breakdown products (such as ceramide and 
diacylglycerol)39 and free radicals and can cause inflammation and even 
mitochondrial dysfunction—that is, interference with the little power plants 
(mitochondria) within our cells.40 This phenomenon is known as lipotoxicity (lipo 
meaning fat, as in liposuction).41 If we take muscle biopsies from people, saturated 
fat buildup in the membranes of their muscle cells correlates with insulin 
resistance.42 Monounsaturated fats, however, are more likely to be detoxified by the 
body or safely stored away.43 
This discrepancy may explain why individuals eating plant-based diets are better 
protected from diabetes. Researchers have compared the insulin resistance and 
muscle-fat content of vegans versus omnivores. Because people eating plant-based 
diets have the advantage of being so much slimmer on average, the researchers 
recruited omnivores who weighed the same as the vegans they were studying so that 
they could see whether plant-based diets had a direct effect beyond the indirect 
benefit of pulling fat out of the muscles by helping people to lose weight. 
The result? There was significantly less fat trapped in the deep calf muscles of 
vegans than in those of comparably slim omnivores.44 Those eating plant-based diets 
have been found to have better insulin sensitivity, better blood sugar levels, better 
insulin levels,45 and even significantly improved function of their beta cells—the 
cells in the pancreas that produce insulin in the first place.46 
In other words, people eating plant-based diets appear to be better at both 
producing and using insulin. 
Preventing Diabetes by Eating More 
Many population studies have shown that people who eat significant amounts of 
legumes (e.g., beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils) tend to weigh less. They also 
have slimmer waists, less obesity, and lower blood pressure compared to people 
who don’t eat many legumes.47 But couldn’t these benefits be due not to the legumes 
themselves but to the fact that people who eat more legumes may eat a healthier diet 
in general? To tease out the connection, researchers used the most powerful tool in 
nutrition research: the interventional trial. Instead of just observing what people eat, 
you change their diets to see what happens. In this case, they put legumes to the test 
by comparing extra legume consumption head-to-head against calorie restriction. 
Reducing belly fat may be the best way to prevent prediabetes from turning into 
full-blown diabetes. Though calorie cutting has been the cornerstone of most weight- 
loss strategies, evidence suggests that the majority of individuals who lose weight by 
portion control eventually regain it. Starving ourselves almost never works long 
term. So wouldn’t it be great if instead we could find a way to eat more food to get 
the same weight-loss benefit? 
The researchers divided overweight subjects into two groups. The first group was 
asked to eat five cups a week of lentils, chickpeas, split peas, or navy beans—but not 
to change their diets in any other way. The second group was asked to simply cut out 
five hundred calories a day from their diets. Guess who got healthier? The group 
directed to eat more food. Eating legumes was shown to be just as effective at 
slimming waistlines and improving blood sugar control as calorie cutting. The 
legume group also gained additional benefits in the form of improved cholesterol and 
insulin regulation.48 This is encouraging news for overweight individuals at risk for 
type 2 diabetes. Instead of just eating smaller portions and reducing the quantity of 
the food they eat, they can also improve the quality of their food by eating legume- 
rich meals. 
Saturated fats may also be toxic to the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. 
At around age twenty, the body stops making new insulin-producing beta cells. After 
that, if they are lost, they may be lost for good.49 Autopsy studies have shown that by 
the time type 2 diabetes is diagnosed later in life, you may have already killed off 
half your beta cells.50 
The toxicity of saturated fats can be demonstrated directly. If we expose beta cells 
to saturated fat51 or to LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in a petri dish, the beta cells begin to 
die.52 The same effect is not observed with the monounsaturated fats concentrated in 
fatty plant foods, such as nuts.53 When you eat saturated fat, both insulin action and 
insulin secretion are impaired within hours.54 The more saturated fat you have in your 
blood, the higher your risk may be for developing type 2 diabetes.55 
Of course, just as everyone who smokes doesn’t develop lung cancer, everyone 
who eats excessive saturated fat doesn’t develop diabetes. There is a genetic 
component. But for those who already have a genetic predisposition, a diet with too 
many calories and rich in saturated fat is considered a cause of type 2 diabetes.56 
Losing Weight with a Plant-Based Diet 
As noted earlier, even if you don’t eat extra fat, the extra fat you wear may cause the 
spillover effect—the tendency for overstretched fat cells to spill fat into the 
bloodstream. The advantage of a whole-food, plant-based approach to weight loss is 
that there may be no need for portion control, skipping meals, or counting calories, 
because most plant foods are naturally nutrient dense and low in calories. 
Figure 2 
Fruits and vegetables, on average, contain about 80–90 percent water. Just as 
fiber can bulk up the volume of foods without adding calories, so can water. 
Experiments have shown that people tend to eat the same amount of food at a meal, 
regardless of calorie count—probably because stretch receptors in the stomach send 
signals to the brain after a certain volume of food has been ingested. When much of 
that volume is a zero-calorie component like fiber or water, that means you can eat 
more food but gain less weight.57 
Figure 2 shows the amounts of broccoli, tomatoes, and strawberries that contain 
one hundred calories, compared with the quantities of one hundred calories of 
chicken, cheese, and fish. You’ll notice that even though the calorie content is the 
same, the volume of these foods is different. So it makes sense that one hundred 
calories of the plants would be more likely to fill you up, while the same one hundred 
calories from animal or processed foods may leave you half-empty. 
That’s why whole-food, plant-based diets are great for people who like to eat, 
since you can basically eat as much as you want without worrying about counting 
calories. 
A head-to-head randomized clinical trial found that a plant-based diet beat out the 
American Diabetes Association’s recommended diet for weight loss. This occurred 
without restricting portions the subjects ate and without requiring calorie or carb 
counting.58 Moreover, a review of similar studies found that, in addition to weight 
loss, individuals consuming plant-based meals experienced improved blood sugar 
control as well as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease compared with people who 
followed diets that included more animal products.59 Such are the benefits of a plant- 
based diet. 
Diabetics are more likely to suffer from strokes and heart failure.60 In fact, 
diabetic patients without a history of coronary heart disease may have the same risk 
of heart attack as nondiabetic individuals with confirmed heart disease.61 In addition 
to improving insulin sensitivity better than conventional diabetic diets, the plant- 
based approach can also lead to a significant drop in LDL cholesterol, thereby 
reducing risk of the number-one killer of diabetics, heart disease.62 But how do 
people feel about making such a major shift in their diets? As Dr. Dean Ornish has 
quipped, are we all going to live longer, or is it just going to seem longer?63 
Apparently, most people who switch to a plant-based diet are happy they did. One 
of the reasons there’s been such great compliance with plant-based dietary 
interventions is that people not only tend to get measurably better, they also tend to 
feel much better. In a recent randomized, clinical weight-loss trial, diabetics were 
split into two groups. Half were put on the conventional diabetic diet as 
recommended by diabetes organizations; the other half were prescribed a plant-based 
diet consisting mostly of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts. At the end of 
six months, the plant-based group reported both a significantly better quality of life 
and significantly higher mood scores than those assigned to the conventional diet. 
Patients consuming the plant-based diet also felt less constrained than those 
consuming the conventional diet. Moreover, disinhibition decreased, meaning 
patients eating vegetarian food were less likely to binge, and the plant-based folks 
tended to feel less hungry as well—both of which could help these subjects sustain 
this way of eating in the long run.64 So not only do plant-based diets appear to work 
better but they may be easier to adopt long term. And with the improvement in mood 
they seem to bring, there may be benefits for both physical and mental health. (See 
chapter 12 for more on this topic.) 
When it comes to maximally lowering diabetes risk, does it matter if you eat just a 
little meat? Researchers in Taiwan sought to answer that question. Traditionally, 
Asian populations have enjoyed very low rates of diabetes. In recent years, however, 
diabetes has emerged on a near-epidemic scale, coinciding with the Westernization 
of Asian diets. Rather than compare vegetarians to modern-day omnivores, these 
researchers compared vegetarians to those eating a traditional Asian diet, which 
customarily included very little fish and other meat. The women ate the equivalent of 
just a single serving of meat each week, while the men had a serving every few 
days.65 
Both the vegetarian and traditional Asian diet groups were following healthy 
diets, avoiding soda, for example. Despite the similarities in diet among the four 
thousand study subjects and after accounting for weight, family history, exercise, and 
smoking, the researchers found that the vegetarian men had only half the odds of 
diabetes as the occasional meat eaters. The vegetarian women had 75 percent lower 
odds of diabetes. Those who avoided meat altogether appeared to have significantly 
lower risk of both prediabetes and diabetes than those who ate plant-based diets with 
an occasional serving of meat, including fish. The researchers were unable to 
compare the diabetes rates of the more than one thousand vegetarians in the study to 
the sixty-nine vegans in the group, however, because the prevalence of diabetes 
among those eating strictly plant-based was zero.66 
Diabetes-Promoting Pollutants 
The dramatic rise in obesity has been blamed squarely on overeating and inactivity. 
But could there be something else about the food we’re eating that’s plumping us up? 
Scientists have begun identifying “obesogenic” chemical pollutants released into the 
environment that may disrupt your metabolism and predispose you to obesity. 
Contaminated food is the main source of exposure to these chemicals, and 95 percent 
of that exposure may come through the consumption of animal fat.67 What’s the big 
deal? A nationwide study found that people with the highest levels of pollutants in 
their bloodstreams had an astounding thirty-eight times the odds of diabetes.68 
Harvard University researchers identified one chemical in particular, 
hexachlorobenzene, as a potent risk factor for the disease.69 
Where is this toxin found? Apparently, at the grocery store. In a supermarket 
survey of a variety of foods, canned sardines were found to be the most heavily 
tainted with hexachlorobenzene, though salmon was found to be the most 
contaminated food overall. Two dozen pesticides were detected in the salmon 
fillets.70 Farmed salmon may be the worst, containing ten times more of a class of 
toxic chemicals called PCBs than wild-caught salmon.71 
Industrial toxins like hexachlorobenzene and PCBs were largely banned decades 
ago. So how could they account for any of our increasing rates of diabetes? The 
answer to this paradox may be our obesity epidemic. The association between these 
toxic chemicals and diabetes was much stronger among obese subjects than in lean 
subjects studied, raising the possibility that your own fat stores are acting as 
reservoirs for these pollutants.72 Overweight individuals may be effectively carrying 
around a personal toxic waste dump on their hips. Without significant weight loss, 
people whose bodies contain salmon pollutants may take between fifty to seventy- 
five years to clear the chemicals from their bodies.73 
Do those who avoid meat completely get enough nutrients? To find out, 
researchers looked at a day in the life of thirteen thousand people all across America. 
They compared the nutrient intake of those who ate meat to those who didn’t. The 
study found that, calorie for calorie, those eating vegetarian diets were getting higher 
intakes of nearly every nutrient: more fiber, more vitamin A, more vitamin C, more 
vitamin E, more of the B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, and folate, as well as more 
calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium. Furthermore, many of the nutrients that are 
so rich in plant-based diets are among the very ones that most Americans normally 
don’t get enough of—namely, vitamins A, C, E, not to mention fiber, calcium, 
magnesium, and potassium. At the same time, people who avoided meat also ingested 
fewer harmful substances, such as sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol.74 
In terms of weight management, those eating meat-free diets consumed an average 
of 364 fewer calories daily.75 That’s about what most people on traditional weight- 
loss programs strive to cut out, meaning a meatless diet could be considered an all- 
you-care-to-eat version of a calorie-restricted weight-loss diet, without having to 
count calories or restrict portion intake. 
Those who eat plant-based diets may even have an 11 percent higher resting 
metabolic rate.76 That means vegetarians could be burning more calories even in 
their sleep. Why? This could be because vegetarians have a higher gene expression 
of a fat-burning enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase, which effectively 
shovels fat into the mitochondrial furnaces in your cells.77 
So a calorie may not be a calorie when it comes to meat. A massive study with an 
equally massive name, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer–Physical 
Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home, and Obesity 
—commonly known as EPIC-PANACEA—was comprised of hundreds of thousands 
of men and women who were followed for years. It’s the largest study ever to 
investigate eating meat and body weight, and it found that meat consumption was 
associated with significant weight gain even after adjusting for calories. This means 
that if you had two people eating the same number of calories, it appears the person 
eating more meat would, on average, gain significantly more weight.78 
REVERSING DIABETES 
What About Drugs and Surgery? 
As noted earlier, those with type 2 diabetes are at elevated risk for such serious 
health problems as heart disease, premature death, blindness, kidney failure, and 
amputations, as well as fractures, depression, and dementia. And the higher people’s 
blood sugar levels, the more heart attacks and strokes they tend to have, the shorter 
their life spans are, and the higher their risk of complications are. To see if these 
outcomes could be averted, a study was performed in which ten thousand diabetics 
were randomized into one of two groups, the standard therapy group (in which the 
goal was just to lower blood sugar levels) and an intensive blood-sugar-lowering 
group (in which the researchers put the diabetics on up to five different classes of 
oral drugs at the same time) with or without insulin injections. The goal was not just 
to drive down blood sugars, as is the case with standard therapy, but to drive them 
down consistently into the normal range.79 
Considering that type 2 diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance, high blood 
sugar is just a symptom of that disease, not the disease itself. So even by artificially 
forcing down blood sugars by any means necessary, we aren’t actually treating the 
cause—just like blood pressure–lowering drugs aren’t actually treating the cause. By 
lowering one of the disease’s effects, however, scientists hoped they could prevent 
some of its devastating complications. 
The results of this study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, sent 
shock waves through the medical community. The intensive blood-sugar-lowering 
therapy actually increased subjects’ mortality, requiring the researchers to halt the 
study prematurely for safety reasons.80 The drug combinations may have been more 
dangerous than the high blood sugars they were trying to treat.81 
Insulin treatments themselves may accelerate aging, worsen diabetic vision loss, 
and promote cancer, obesity, and atherosclerosis.82 Insulin can promote inflammation 
in the arteries, which may help explain the increased death rate in the intensively 
treated group.83 So rather than trying to overcome insulin resistance by brute force— 
just pumping in more and more insulin—isn’t it better to treat the disease itself by 
eliminating the unhealthy diet that caused it? That reminds me of people who undergo 
bypass surgery for clogged arteries. If they keep eating unhealthfully, their bypasses 
will eventually get clogged too. It’s better to treat the cause than the symptoms. 
How about surgery for diabetes? Gastric bypass surgery—which effectively 
reduces the size of the stomach by 90 percent or more—is one of the most successful 
treatment methods for type 2 diabetes, with reported long-term remission rates of up 
to 83 percent. These results had led to the suggestion that gastric bypass surgery 
improves diabetes by somehow altering digestive hormones, but this interpretation 
ignores the fact that patients are placed on a severely limited diet for up to two 
weeks following the procedure to recover from the surgery. Extreme calorie 
restriction alone can reverse diabetes. So is the success of surgery the result of the 
operation itself or due to the restrictive diet? 
Once again, researchers designed a study to uncover the answer.84 They compared 
diabetics placed on the same postoperative diet before and after they actually had the 
surgery. Amazingly, they found that the diet alone worked better than the surgery 
even in the same group of patients: The subjects’ blood sugar control was better in 
the absence of the operation. This means the benefits of major surgery may be 
obtained without you ever having to go under the knife and getting your internal 
organs rearranged.85 
The bottom line: Blood sugar levels can normalize within a week of eating six 
hundred calories daily, because fat is pulled out of the muscles, liver, and pancreas, 
allowing them to function normally again.86 
This reversal of diabetes can be accomplished either by voluntary calorie 
restriction87 or involuntarily, by having most of your stomach removed, a form of 
compulsory food restriction. Undergoing surgery may be easier than starving 
yourself, but major surgery carries major risks, both during the operation and 
afterward. These risks include bleeding, leakage, infections, erosions, herniation, and 
severe nutritional deficiencies.88 
Surgery or starvation? There’s got to be a better way, and, in fact, there is. Instead 
of changing the quantity of food you eat, it’s possible to reverse diabetes by changing 
the quality of that food. 
Does Eating Obesity Cause Obesity? 
The EPIC-PANACEA study, which found that meat consumption is associated with 
weight gain even independent of calories, identified poultry as potentially the most 
fattening meat,89 a finding that has since been confirmed in another study. Men and 
women eating even a single ounce of chicken a day (think two chicken nuggets) had a 
significantly greater gain in body mass index over the fourteen-year follow-up period 
than those who consumed no chicken at all.90 Perhaps this news shouldn’t be 
surprising, considering how fat chickens themselves are now genetically manipulated 
to become. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about one hundred years ago, a 
single serving of chicken may have contained only sixteen fat calories. Nowadays, 
one serving of chicken may have more than two hundred calories of fat. The fat 
content in poultry has ballooned from less than two grams per serving a century ago 
to up to twenty-three grams today. That’s ten times more fat. Chicken now contains 
two to three times more calories from fat than from protein, leading nutrition 
researchers to ask, “Does eating obesity cause obesity in the consumer?”91 As the 
beef industry is proud of pointing out, even skinless chicken can have more fat, and 
more artery-clogging saturated fat, than a dozen different cuts of steak.92 
Reversing Diabetes with Food 
We’ve known since the siege of Paris in 1870 that type 2 diabetes can be reversed by 
an extreme reduction in food intake. Parisian doctors documented how glucose 
disappeared from their patients’ urine after people went weeks without food.93 
Diabetes specialists have long known that iron-willed patients who are able to lose 
up to one-fifth of their body weight can reverse their diabetes and bring their 
metabolic function back to normal.94 
Instead of starving by eating less food, though, what if diabetics just ate better 
food, as in a 90 percent or more plant-based diet of all-you-can-eat greens, lots of 
other vegetables and beans, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and seeds? In a pilot study, 
thirteen diabetic men and women were told to eat at least one big salad every day, as 
well as veggie-bean soup, a handful of nuts and seeds, fruit at every meal, a pound of 
cooked greens, and some whole grains; to restrict their animal product consumption; 
and to eliminate refined grains, junk food, and oil. Then, the researchers measured 
their hemoglobin A1c levels, considered the best measure of how poorly blood 
sugars have been controlled over time. 
At the onset of the study, the diabetics had A1c levels averaging 8.2. An A1c 
level under 5.7 is considered normal, between 5.7 and 6.4 is considered prediabetic, 
and above 6.5 is considered diabetic. However, the American Diabetes 
Association’s target is just to get most diabetics down below 7.0.95 (Recall that 
intensive blood-sugar-lowering trials using drugs, which tried to push A1c levels 
under 6.0, unfortunately ended up pushing many diabetics six feet under.) 
After about seven months of eating a diet centered on whole plant foods, the 
subjects’ A1c levels dropped to a nondiabetic 5.8—and this was after they were able 
to stop taking most of their medications.96 We’ve known diabetes can be reversed 
with an extremely low-calorie diet.97 Now we know that it can also be reversed with 
an extremely healthy diet, but is that because it was also low in calories? The study 
subjects lost about as much weight on the vegetable-packed, plant-based diet as 
people who went on semistarvation diets based on liquid meal replacements.98 But 
even if this type of diabetes reversal was just about calorie restriction, which would 
be healthier? Subsisting on mostly diet shakes made out of sugar, powdered milk, 
corn syrup, and oil, or eating a plant-based diet where you can enjoy real food and 
lots of it? 
Surprisingly, even participants who temporarily didn’t lose weight on the plant- 
based diet, or who actually gained weight, still appeared to improve their diabetes. 
In other words, the beneficial effects of plant-based diets may extend beyond weight 
loss.99 However, the study described just a handful of people, had no control group, 
and included only those who could stick to the eating plan. To prove plant-based 
diets could actually improve diabetes independent of weight loss, researchers would 
need to design a study in which they switched people to a healthy diet but forced 
them to eat so much that they didn’t lose any weight. 
Just such a study was published more than thirty-five years ago. Type 2 diabetics 
were placed on a plant-based diet and weighed every day. If they started losing any 
weight, they were made to eat more food—so much that some of the participants 
actually had trouble eating it all! The result: Even with no weight loss, subjects on 
the plant-based diet saw their insulin requirements cut by about 60 percent, meaning 
the amount of insulin these diabetics had to inject dropped by more than half. 
Furthermore, half of the diabetics were able to get off insulin altogether, despite no 
change in body weight—just by eating a healthier diet.100 
This wasn’t over the course of months or years, either. This was after eating a 
plant-based diet for an average of only sixteen days. Some of the subjects had been 
diabetic for two decades and had been injecting twenty units of insulin a day. Yet 
within two weeks of eating a plant-based diet, they were off insulin altogether. One 
patient was on thirty-two units of insulin per day at the onset of the study. After 
eighteen days, his blood sugar levels plummeted so low that insulin injections were 
no longer necessary. Even at approximately the same body weight, he had lower 
blood sugars on a plant-based diet using no insulin than when he had been on a 
regular diet using thirty-two units of insulin daily.101 That’s the power of plants. 
Curing Diabetic Neuropathy 
Up to 50 percent of diabetics eventually develop neuropathy, or damage to their 
nerves.102 Neuropathy can be very painful, and that pain is frequently resistant to 
conventional treatments. No medical treatment is considered effective for the 
condition.103 We doctors are left with only steroids, opiates, and antidepressants to 
try to ease our patients’ suffering. But then a remarkable study was published, 
entitled “Regression of Diabetic Neuropathy with Total Vegetarian (Vegan) Diet.” 
Twenty-one diabetics who had been suffering from painful neuropathy for up to ten 
years were placed on a whole-food, plant-based diet. After years and years of 
suffering, seventeen out of the twenty-one patients reported that they felt complete 
relief from their pain—within days. Their numbness noticeably improved too. And 
the side effects were all good: The diabetics lost an average of ten pounds, their 
blood sugar levels dropped, their insulin needs dropped in half, and, in five of the 
patients, not only was their painful neuropathy cured, so was, apparently, their 
diabetes. After having been diabetic for up to twenty years, they were off all blood 
sugar drugs in less than a month.104 
On top of that, the diabetics’ triglyceride and cholesterol levels improved on 
average as well. High blood pressures dropped by so much that half of the subjects 
also appeared cured of their hypertension. Within three weeks, the subjects’ need for 
high blood pressure medications dropped by 80 percent.105 (This is why it is 
critically important to work with your doctor when radically improving your diet, 
because if they don’t reduce or eliminate your medications accordingly, your blood 
sugar levels or blood pressure may drop too low.) 
We’ve long known that plant-based diets can reverse diabetes 106 and 
hypertension,107 but reversing nerve damage pain with diet was new. 
This study involved a live-in program in which patients were provided meals. 
What happened after they were sent home, back into the real world? These seventeen 
subjects were followed for years, and in all cases but one, the relief from their 
painful neuropathy continued—or improved even further. How were the researchers 
able to achieve such a high degree of dietary compliance even in an uncontrolled 
setting? “Pain and ill health,” the researchers wrote, “are strong motivating 
factors.”108 In other words: Because plant-based diets work. 
Think about it. Patients walk in with one of the most painful, frustrating, and hard- 
to-treat conditions in all of medicine, and three-quarters of them were cured in a 
handful of days using a natural, nontoxic treatment—namely, a diet composed of 
whole plant foods. This should have been front-page news. 
How could nerve damage pain be reversed so suddenly? It didn’t appear to 
involve the improvement in blood sugar control. It took approximately ten days for 
the diet to control the diabetes itself, but the pain was gone in as few as four days.109 
The most interesting speculation was that trans fats naturally found in meat and 
dairy could be causing an inflammatory response in the patients’ bodies. The 
researchers found that a significant percentage of the fat under the skin of those who 
ate meat, or even just dairy and eggs, was composed of trans fats, whereas those who 
had been on a strictly whole-food, plant-based diet had no detectable trans fat in their 
tissues.110 
The researchers stuck needles into the buttocks of subjects who had been eating 
different diets and discovered that people who had been on a whole-food, plant- 
based diet for nine months or more appeared to have removed all the trans fat from 
their bodies (or at least from their butts!).111 But their neuropathy pain didn’t take 
nine months to get better. It improved in closer to nine days. It’s more likely that this 
amazing reversal was due to an improvement in blood flow.112 
Nerves contain tiny blood vessels that may become clogged, depriving the nerves 
of oxygen. Indeed, biopsies of leg nerves in diabetics with severe progressive 
neuropathy have shown arterial disease within the sural nerve in the leg.113 However, 
within days of eating healthier meals, blood flow may improve to the extent that 
neuropathy disappears.114 Within an average of two years of eating a plant-based diet 
composed mostly of rice and fruits, even diabetic vision loss can be reversed in as 
many as 30 percent of patients.115 
So why didn’t I learn about any of this in medical school? There’s little money to 
be made from prescribing plants instead of pills. The neuropathy pain reversal study 
was published more than twenty years ago, and the blindness reversal studies more 
than fifty years ago. As one commentator wrote, “The neglect of this important work 
by the broader medical community is little short of unconscionable.”116 
WHtR Versus BMI 
The body mass index (BMI) is a better predictor of disease than body weight alone, 
as BMI takes height into account. But BMI has long been criticized for not 
considering the location or the nature of your weight. Bodybuilders, for instance, 
have extremely low body fat but can have off-the-chart BMIs, because muscle is 
heavier than fat. 
Today, it’s generally accepted that health risks can be determined as much by the 
relative distribution of body fat as by its total amount.117 What’s the worst kind? 
Abdominal fat—the kind that builds up around your internal organs. Having a 
potbelly may be a strong predictor of premature death.118 
Figure 3 
Both the men in figure 3 have the same BMI, but the distribution of weight is 
different. People with the so-called apple shape, with body fat concentrated in the 
abdominal region, may have the lowest life expectancy.119 
Fortunately, there may be an even better tool than BMI that we can use to gauge 
the health risks of body fat. It’s called Waist-to-Height Ratio, or WHtR. 120 Instead of 
a scale, grab a simple measuring tape. Stand up straight and take a deep breath, 
exhale, and let it all hang out. The circumference of your belly (halfway between the 
top of your hip bones and the bottom of your rib cage) should be half your height— 
ideally, less. If that measurement is more than half your height, it’s time to start eating 
healthier and exercising more regardless of your weight.121 
Type 2 diabetes in the United States is reaching epidemic proportions. The CDC 
estimates that 37 percent of U.S. adults—and 51 percent of adults over sixty-five— 
have prediabetes. That’s eighty-six million people,122 most of whom will become 
full-blown diabetics.123 But type 2 diabetes can be prevented, arrested, and even 
reversed with a healthy-enough diet. Unfortunately, doctors don’t tend to educate 
their patients about diabetes prevention. Only about one in three prediabetic patients 
reports ever being told by their doctors to exercise or to improve their diets.124 
Possible reasons for not counseling patients include a lack of insurance 
reimbursement for the extra time spent, a lack of resources, a lack of time, and a lack 
of knowledge.125 We’re just not training doctors how to empower the people they 
serve. 
The current medical education system has yet to adapt to the great transformation 
of disease from acute to chronic. Medicine is no longer about just setting broken 
bones or curing strep throat. Such chronic diseases as diabetes are now the principal 
cause of death and disability in America, consuming three-quarters of the nation’s 
health care budget. Medical education has yet to recognize and respond to the 
changing nature of disease patterns, which now requires a focus on prevention and 
lifestyle change.126 How far behind the times is the medical profession? A report by 
the Institute of Medicine on medical training concluded that the fundamental approach 
to medical education has not changed since 1910.127 
Not long ago, I received an e-mail that helps sum up where we are. Tonah, a 
sixty-five-year-old Native American, had been on insulin for type 2 diabetes for the 
last twenty-seven years. He was told by his doctor that Native Americans were 
“genetically predisposed” to the disease. He just had to live with it, including the 
excruciating nerve pain, three heart stents, and erectile dysfunction. After watching 
my “Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death” video on NutritionFacts.org, his 
granddaughter convinced him to try a plant-based diet. 
It wasn’t easy, since the nearest store with fresh food was fifty miles away. 
Nevertheless, in less than two weeks, he turned his life around. His nerve pain 
diminished dramatically, to the point where it no longer kept him up at night. He lost 
thirty pounds in a matter of months and no longer needed insulin. His own doctor 
couldn’t believe this was possible and ordered a CT scan to check for tumors. There 
weren’t any. Now he feels better than he has in years. 
“I’m grateful that my granddaughter has stopped seeing me as a sick old man,” 
Tonah concluded his note. “I feel young again, Doc.” 
 CHAPTER 7 
How Not to Die from High Blood 
Pressure 
The most comprehensive and systematic analysis of the causes of death ever 
undertaken was published recently in the Lancet, one of the world’s leading medical 
journals.1 Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Burden of 
Disease Study involved nearly five hundred researchers from more than three 
hundred institutions in fifty countries and examined nearly one hundred thousand data 
sources.2 The results allow us to answer such questions as “How many lives could 
we save if people around the world cut back on soda?” The best answer? 299,521.3 
So soft drinks and their empty calories don’t just fail to promote health—they 
actually seem to promote death. But apparently soda isn’t nearly as deadly as bacon, 
bologna, ham, and hot dogs. Processed meat is blamed for the deaths of more than 
eight hundred thousand people every year. Worldwide, that’s four times more people 
than who die from illicit drug use.4 
The study also noted which foods, if added to the diet, might save lives. Eating 
more whole grains could potentially save 1.7 million lives a year. More vegetables? 
1.8 million lives. How about nuts and seeds? 2.5 million lives. The researchers 
didn’t look at beans, but of the foods they considered, which does the world need 
most? Fruit. Worldwide, if humanity ate more fruit, we might save 4.9 million lives. 
That’s nearly 5 million lives hanging in the balance, and their salvation isn’t 
medication or a new vaccine—it may be just more fruit.5 
The number-one risk factor for death in the world they identified is high blood 
pressure.6 Also known as hypertension, high blood pressure lays waste to nine 
million people worldwide every year.7 It kills so many people because it contributes 
to deaths from a variety of causes, including aneurysms, heart attacks, heart failure, 
kidney failure, and stroke. 
You’ve probably had your blood pressure taken at the doctor’s office. The nurse 
reads off two numbers, say, for example, “115 over 75.” The first number 
(“systolic”) represents the pressure in your arteries as your blood pumps from the 
heart; the second number (“diastolic”) is the pressure in your arteries while the heart 
is resting between beats. The American Heart Association defines “normal” blood 
pressure as a systolic pressure under 120 and a diastolic pressure under 80—or 
120/80. Anything above 140/90 is considered hypertensive. Values in between are 
considered prehypertensive.8 
Increased blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and can damage the sensitive 
blood vessels in your eyes and kidneys, cause bleeding in the brain, and even lead 
certain arteries to balloon and rupture. The fact that hypertension can damage so 
many organ systems and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, two of our 
leading killers, explains why it is the number-one killer risk factor worldwide. 
In the United States, nearly seventy-eight million people have high blood pressure 
—that’s about one in three American adults.9 As you age, your blood pressure tends 
to get higher and higher. In fact, after age sixty, 65 percent of Americans can expect 
to be diagnosed with the condition.10 This has led many people, including doctors, to 
assume that high blood pressure, like wrinkles or gray hair, is just an inevitable 
consequence of getting older. However, we’ve known for nearly a century that this 
isn’t true. 
In the 1920s, researchers measured the blood pressure of a thousand native 
Kenyans who ate a low-sodium diet centered around whole plant foods—whole 
grains, beans, fruits, and dark, leafy greens, and other vegetables.11 Up until age 
forty, the blood pressure of the rural Africans was similar to that of Europeans and 
Americans, about 125/80. However, as Westerners aged, their blood pressure began 
to surge past the Kenyans. By age sixty, the average Westerner was hypertensive, 
with blood pressure exceeding 140/90. What about the Kenyans? By age sixty, their 
average blood pressure had actually improved to an average of about 110/70.12 
The 140/90 threshold for hypertension is considered an arbitrary cutoff.13 Just 
like having too much cholesterol or body fat, there are benefits to having a blood 
pressure that is even lower than the “normal” range. So even people who start out 
with a so-called normal blood pressure of 120/80 appear to benefit from going down 
to 110/70.14 But is it possible to do that? Look at the Kenyans—not only is it 
possible, it appears typical for people who live healthy, plant-based lifestyles. 
Over a two-year period, 1,800 patients were admitted into a rural Kenyan 
hospital. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. There also 
wasn’t a single case found of America’s number-one killer, atherosclerosis.15 
High blood pressure, then, appears to be a choice. You can continue eating the 
artery-bursting Western diet, or you can choose to take off the pressure. The truth is 
that eliminating humanity’s primary risk factor for death may be simple. No drugs, no 
scalpels. Just forks. 
Sodium 
The two most prominent dietary risks for death and disability in the world may be not 
eating enough fruit and eating too much salt. Nearly five million people appear to die 
every year as a result of not eating enough fruit,16 while eating too much salt may kill 
up to four million.17 
Salt is a compound made up of about 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. 
Sodium is an essential nutrient, but vegetables and other natural foods provide the 
small amounts of sodium you need in your diet. If you consume too much, it can cause 
water retention, and your body may respond by raising your blood pressure to push 
the excess fluid and salt out of your system.18 
For the first 90 percent of human evolution, we likely ate diets containing less 
than the equivalent of a quarter teaspoon of salt’s worth of sodium a day.19 Why? 
Because we likely ate mostly plants.20 We went millions of years without 
saltshakers, so our bodies evolved into sodium-conserving machines. That served us 
well until we discovered that salt could be used to preserve foods.21 Without 
refrigeration, this was a boon to human civilization. It didn’t matter that the addition 
of salt to our food resulted in a general rise in blood pressure—the alternative was 
starving to death because all our food rotted away. 
But where does that leave us now? After all, we no longer have to live off pickles 
and jerky. Humans are genetically programmed to eat ten times less sodium than we 
do now.22 Many so-called low-salt diets can actually be considered high-salt diets. 
That’s why it’s critical to understand what the concept of “normal” is when it comes 
to sodium. Having a “normal” salt intake can lead to a “normal” blood pressure, 
which can contribute to us dying from all the “normal” causes, like heart attacks and 
strokes.23 
The American Heart Association recommends everyone consume less than 1,500 
mg of sodium daily24—that’s about three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. The average 
American adult consumes more than double that amount, about 3,500 mg daily.25 
Reducing sodium consumption by just 15 percent worldwide could save millions of 
lives every year.26 
If we could cut our salt intake by about a half teaspoon a day, which is achievable 
by avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to our food, we might prevent 22 percent 
of stroke deaths and 16 percent of fatal heart attacks. That’s potentially more lives 
saved than if we were able to successfully treat people with blood pressure pills.27 
Simply put, reducing salt is an easy at-home intervention that may be more powerful 
than filling a prescription from the pharmacy. Up to ninety-two thousand American 
lives could be saved each year simply by eating less salt.28 
The evidence that sodium raises blood pressure is clear, including double-blind, 
randomized trials dating back decades.29 If we take subjects with high blood pressure 
and put them on a sodium-restricted diet, their blood pressure drops. If we keep them 
on the low-salt diet and add a placebo, nothing happens. However, if we instead give 
subjects salt in the form of a time-release sodium pill, their blood pressure goes back 
up again.30 The more sodium we give them secretly, the higher their blood pressure 
climbs.31 
Even just a single meal can do it. If we take people with normal blood pressure 
and give them a bowl of soup containing the amount of salt that may be found in an 
average American meal,32 their blood pressure climbs over the next three hours 
compared to eating the same soup without any added salt.33 Dozens of similar studies 
demonstrate that if you reduce your salt intake, you reduce your blood pressure. And 
the greater the reduction, the greater the benefit. But if you don’t cut down, chronic 
high salt intake can lead to a gradual increase in blood pressure throughout life.34 
Doctors used to be taught that a “normal” systolic blood pressure is 
approximately 100 plus age. Indeed that’s about what you’re born with. Babies start 
out with a blood pressure around 95/60. But, as you age, that 95 can go up to 120 by 
your twenties. By the time you’re in your forties, it can be up to 140—the official 
cutoff for high blood pressure—and then keep climbing as you get older.35 
What would happen if, instead of consuming ten times more sodium than what 
your bodies were designed to handle, you just ate the natural amount found in whole 
foods? Is it possible your blood pressure would stay low your whole life? To test 
that theory, we’d have to find a population in modern times that doesn’t use salt, eat 
processed food, or go out to eat. To find a no-salt culture, scientists had to go deep 
into the Amazon rainforest.36 
Strangers to saltshakers, Cheetos, and KFC, the Yanomamo Indians were found to 
have the lowest sodium intake ever recorded—which is to say the sodium intake we 
evolved eating.37 Lo and behold, researchers found that the blood pressures among 
older Yanomamo were the same as those of adolescents. 38 In other words, they start 
out with an average blood pressure of about 100/60 and stay that way for life. The 
researchers couldn’t find a single case of high blood pressure.39 
Why do we suspect it was the sodium? After all, the Yanomamos studied didn’t 
drink alcohol, ate a high-fiber, plant-based diet, had lots of exercise, and were not 
obese.40 An interventional trial could prove that sodium was the culprit. Imagine if 
we took people literally dying from out-of-control high blood pressure (known as 
malignant hypertension), a condition from which you go blind from bleeding into your 
eyes, your kidneys shut down, and your heart eventually fails. What if you put these 
patients on a Yanomamo-level salt intake—in other words, a normal-for-the-human- 
species salt intake? 
Enter Dr. Walter Kempner and his rice-and-fruit diet. Without drugs, he brought 
patients with eye-popping blood pressures like 240/150 down to 105/80 with dietary 
changes alone. How could he ethically withhold medication from such seriously ill 
patients? Modern high-blood-pressure pills hadn’t been invented yet—Dr. Kempner 
conducted his work back in the 1940s.41 Back then, malignant hypertension was a 
death sentence, with a life expectancy of about six months.42 Nevertheless, he was 
able to reverse the course of disease with diet in more than 70 percent of cases.43 
Though the diet wasn’t merely extremely low sodium—it was also strictly plant- 
based and low in fat and protein—Dr. Kempner is now recognized as the person who 
established, beyond any shadow of doubt, that high blood pressure can often be 
lowered by a low-sodium diet.44 
In addition to high blood pressure, salty meals can significantly impair artery 
function,45 even among people whose blood pressure tends to be unresponsive to salt 
intake.46 In other words, salt itself can injure our arteries independent of its impact 
on blood pressure. And that harm begins within thirty minutes.47 
Using a technique called laser Doppler flowmetry, researchers are able to 
measure blood flow in the tiny vessels in the skin. After a high-sodium meal, there is 
significantly less blood flow—unless vitamin C is injected into the skin, which 
appears to reverse much of the sodium-induced suppression of blood vessel function. 
So, if an antioxidant helps block the sodium effect, then the mechanism by which salt 
impairs arterial function may be oxidative stress, the formation of free radicals in 
your bloodstream.48 It turns out that sodium intake appears to suppress the activity of 
a key antioxidant enzyme in the body called superoxide dismutase,49 which has the 
ability to detoxify a million free radicals per second.50 With the action of this 
workhorse of an enzyme stifled by sodium, artery-crippling levels of oxidative stress 
can build up. 
After one salty meal, not only does blood pressure increase but the arteries 
actually begin to stiffen.51 This may be how we figured out thousands of years ago 
that too much salt was bad for us. Quoting from a translation of The Yellow 
Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine , an ancient Chinese medical text, “If too 
much salt is used in food, the pulse hardens…”52 It turns out that we may not need a 
double-blind trial; maybe we just have to feed someone a bag of potato chips and 
take his or her pulse. 
Unsurprisingly, the salt industry isn’t thrilled about the idea of us cutting back on 
salt. Back in 2009, the American Heart Association quoted the chair of the U.S. 
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as saying that Americans should reduce 
their sodium intake. The Salt Institute, a salt industry trade organization, accused her 
of having an “unhealthy prejudice” against salt, arguing that she had “pre-judged the 
salt issue.”53 This is like the tobacco industry complaining that people at the 
American Lung Association are biased against smoking. Of course, the Salt Institute 
wasn’t the only aggrieved party. Cheese, it turns out, ranks as a leading contributor of 
sodium in the American diet,54 and the National Dairy Council stood shoulder-to- 
shoulder with Big Salt in its condemnation of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee recommendations.55 
The salt industry has its own PR and lobbying firms to play tobacco-industry-style 
tactics to downplay the dangers of its product.56 But the real villains aren’t 
necessarily the salt-mine barons—it’s the processed food industry. The trillion- 
dollar processed food industry uses dirt-cheap added salt and sugar to sell us their 
junk.57 That’s why it’s not easy avoiding sodium on the typical American diet, since 
three-quarters of salt comes from processed foods rather than a saltshaker.58 By 
hooking you on hypersweet and hypersalty foods, your taste buds get so dampened 
that natural foods can taste like cardboard. Indeed, the ripest fruit may not be as 
sweet as Froot Loops. 
But there are two other major reasons the food industry adds salt to foods. If you 
add salt to meat, it draws in water. This way, a company can increase the weight of 
its product by nearly 20 percent. Since meat is sold by the pound, that’s 20 percent 
more profits for very little added cost. Second, as everyone knows, eating salt makes 
us thirsty. There’s a reason bars put out free baskets of salted nuts and pretzels, and 
it’s the same reason soda conglomerates own snack-food companies. A cold drink 
and a salty snack go hand in hand. It may be no coincidence that Pepsi and Frito-Lay 
are part of the same corporation.59 
Pop quiz! Which has been reported to contain the most sodium: a serving of beef, 
a serving of baked all-natural chicken, a large McDonald’s french fries, or a serving 
of salted pretzels? 
The answer? Chicken. The poultry industry commonly injects chicken carcasses 
with salt water to artificially inflate their weight, yet they can still be labelled “100 
percent natural.” Consumer Reports found that some supermarket chickens were 
pumped so full of salt that they registered a whopping 840 mg of sodium per serving 
—that could mean more than a full day’s worth of sodium in just one chicken 
breast.60 
The number-one source of sodium for American kids and teens is pizza.61 A 
single slice of Pizza Hut pepperoni pizza can contain half your recommended sodium 
intake limit for the entire day.62 For adults over fifty, it’s bread, but between the ages 
of twenty and fifty, the greatest contributor of sodium to the diet is chicken—not the 
canned soups, pretzels, or potato chips one might expect.63 
How can you overcome your built-in craving for salt, sugar, and fat? Just give it a 
few weeks, and your taste buds will start to change. When researchers put people on 
a low-salt diet, over time, the research subjects increasingly enjoyed the taste of salt- 
free soup and became turned off by the salt-heavy soup they had previously craved. 
As the study progressed, when the participants were allowed to salt their own soup 
to taste, they preferred less and less salt as their taste buds became acclimated to 
healthier levels.64 
The same may be true for sugar and fat. It’s likely that humans actually taste fat, 
just like they taste sweet, sour, and salty flavors.65 People placed on low-fat diets 
start preferring low-fat foods over fatty options.66 Your tongue may actually become 
more sensitive to fat, and the more sensitive your tongue becomes, the less butter, 
meat, dairy, and eggs you eat. On the flip side, if you eat too much of these foods, you 
may blunt your taste for fat, which can cause you to eat more calories and more fat, 
dairy, meat, and eggs and ultimately gain weight.67 This can all happen in just a 
matter of weeks.68 
There are three things you can do to shake the salt habit.69 First, don’t add salt at 
the table. (One out of three people may add salt to their food before even tasting it!)70 
Second, stop adding salt when cooking. The food may taste bland at first, but within 
two to four weeks, the salt-taste receptors in your mouth become more sensitive, and 
food tastes better. Believe it or not, after two weeks, you may actually prefer the 
taste of food with less salt.71 Try any combination of such fantastic flavorings as 
pepper, onions, garlic, tomatoes, sweet peppers, basil, parsley, thyme, celery, lime, 
chili powder, rosemary, smoked paprika, curry, coriander, and lemon instead. 72 
Also, it’s probably a good idea to avoid eating out as much as possible. Even non- 
fast-food restaurants tend to pile on the salt.73 Finally, do what you can to avoid 
processed foods. 
In most countries studied, processed foods provide only about half of people’s 
sodium intake, but in the United States, we consume so much sodium from processed 
foods that even if we completely stopped adding salt in the kitchen and dining room, 
we’d still only reduce our salt intake by a small fraction.74 Try to buy foods with 
fewer milligrams of sodium on the label than there are grams in the serving size. For 
example, if it’s a 100 g serving size, the product should have less than 100 mg of 
sodium.75 Alternatively, you can shoot for fewer milligrams of sodium per serving 
than there are calories. That’s a trick I learned from one of my favorite dietitians, Jeff 
Novick. Most people get around 2,200 calories a day, so if everything you ate had 
more calories than sodium, you would probably make it at least under the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans’ upper limit of 2,300 mg of sodium a day.76 
Ideally, though, you’d buy mostly food without any labels at all. It is considered 
almost impossible to come up with a diet consisting of unprocessed natural foods that 
exceeds the strict 1,500 mg a day American Heart Association guidelines for sodium 
reduction.77 
Whole Grains 
On average, high blood pressure medications reduce the risk of heart attack by 15 
percent and the risk of stroke by 25 percent.78 But in a randomized, controlled trial, 
three portions of whole grains a day were able to help people achieve this blood- 
pressure-lowering benefit too.79 The study revealed that a diet rich in whole grains 
yields the same benefits without the adverse side effects commonly associated with 
antihypertensive drugs, such as electrolyte disturbances in those taking diuretics (also 
known as water pills);80 increased breast cancer risk for those taking calcium- 
channel blockers (like Norvasc or Cardizem);81 lethargy and impotence for those on 
beta blockers (like Lopressor and Corgard);82 sudden, potentially life-threatening 
swelling for those taking ACE inhibitors (like Vasotec and Altace); 83 and an 
increased risk of serious fall injuries for apparently any class of these blood pressure 
drugs.84 
Whole grains do have side effects, though. Good ones! Whole-grain intake is 
associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, weight gain,85 
and colon cancer.86 Take note of the whole, however. While whole grains, such as 
oats, whole wheat, and brown rice, have been shown to reduce your risk of 
developing chronic disease,87 refined grains may actually increase your risk. 
Harvard University researchers, for example, found that while regular consumption 
of brown rice was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, consuming white 
rice was associated with higher risk. Daily servings of white rice were associated 
with a 17 percent greater risk of diabetes, whereas replacing one-third of a serving a 
day of white rice for brown rice might lead to a 16 percent drop in risk. And it looks 
like replacing white rice with oats and barley may be an even more powerful step, 
associated with a 36 percent drop in diabetes risk.88 
Given the improvements in cardiac risk factors seen in interventional trials of 
whole grains,89 it’s not surprising to see a reduction in the progression of arterial 
disease among those who regularly eat them. In studies of two of the most important 
arteries in the body, the coronary arteries that feed the heart and the carotid arteries 
that feed the brain, people who ate the most whole grains had significantly slower 
narrowing of their arteries.90,91 Since atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries is our 
leading killer, ideally, you should not just slow down the process but actually stop or 
even reverse it altogether. As we saw in chapter 1, this appears to require more than 
just whole grains; whole vegetables, whole fruits, whole beans, and other whole 
plant foods are needed, along with a significant reduction in your intake of trans fats, 
saturated fats, and cholesterol, the food components that contribute to clogging your 
arteries shut. 
What About the DASH Diet? 
What if you are among the seventy-eight million Americans who already have high 
blood pressure? How can you bring it down? 
The American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology 
(ACC), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) all recommend 
that patients first try lifestyle modifications, such as reducing body weight, limiting 
sodium and alcohol intake, getting more exercise, and eating a healthier diet.92 
However, if their recommended lifestyle changes don’t work, then it’s off to the 
pharmacy. First up is a diuretic (water pill), and before you can spell 
“pharmaceutical cocktail,” the medications begin piling up until your blood pressure 
comes down. High blood pressure patients commonly end up on three different 
antihypertensive drugs at a time,93 yet only about half tend to stick to even the first- 
line drugs.94 (This is due in part to all their side effects, which can include erectile 
dysfunction, fatigue, and leg cramps.)95 At the end of all of this, the drugs still haven’t 
gotten to the root cause of the problem. The cause of high blood pressure isn’t 
medication deficiency. The underlying cause is what you eat and how you live. 
As we discussed earlier, the ideal blood pressure, defined as the level at which 
lowering it further yields no additional benefit, is probably around 110/70.96 Can you 
really get it that low without medication? Remember, this was the average blood 
pressure of men more than sixty years old in rural Africa on no treatment other than 
their traditional, plant-based diets and lifestyles.97 In rural China, we find similar 
results: 110/70 throughout life without any increase with age.98 The reason we 
suspect that the plant-based nature of their diets is responsible is because, in the 
Western world, the only group able to routinely achieve these blood pressure 
readings is vegetarians.99 
So do the AHA/ACC/CDC guidelines recommend that people with high blood 
pressure eat a meat-free diet? No. They recommend the DASH diet, which stands for 
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, an eating plan specifically designed to 
lower blood pressure.100 Although it’s been described as a lactovegetarian diet101 
(dairy, but no meat or eggs), that isn’t accurate. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, 
vegetables, and low-fat dairy, but meat is still present—you’re just supposed to eat 
less of it.102 
Why not recommend an even more plant-based diet? We’ve known for decades 
that “food of animal origin was highly significantly associated with systolic and 
diastolic B[lood] P[ressure] after the age and weight effects were removed.”103 
That’s a quote from a series of studies performed by renowned physician Frank 
Sacks and colleagues back in the 1970s, but there are studies going all the way back 
to the 1920s demonstrating that adding meat to a plant-based diet can significantly 
elevate blood pressure in a matter of days.104 
Why isn’t the DASH diet meatless? Based on the work of Dr. Sacks at Harvard 
University, the American Heart Association acknowledged that “[s]ome of the lowest 
B[lood]P[ressure]s observed in industrialized countries have been documented in 
strict vegetarians.…”105 Were the designers of the DASH diet just not aware of Dr. 
Sacks’s work? No, the chair of the committee that designed the diet was Dr. Sacks.106 
The reason that the DASH diet was modeled explicitly after vegetarian diets but 
was not meat-free itself might surprise you. The primary design goal of the DASH 
diet was to explicitly create eating patterns “that would have the blood pressure 
lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet yet contain enough animal products to make 
them palatable to nonvegetarians.…”107 Dr. Sacks had even shown that the more 
dairy vegetarians consumed, the higher their blood pressure appeared to rise.108 But 
he figured there was no point in calling for a diet he believed few would follow. 
This is a recurring theme in official dietary recommendations. Instead of simply 
telling you what the science shows and then letting you make up your own mind, 
experts patronize the population by advocating what they think is practical rather than 
ideal. By making the decision for you, they undermine those willing to make even 
greater changes for optimal health. 
The DASH diet does help to bring down blood pressure, but the primary effect 
seems to arise not from the switch to low-fat dairy and white meat or the reduction in 
sweets and added fats but from the added fruits and vegetables.109 If the benefits are 
due to the added plant foods, why not strive to center people’s diets more around 
these healthiest of foods in the first place? 
This question is even more pointed given a 2014 meta-analysis (a compilation of 
many similar studies) showing that vegetarian diets may be particularly good at 
lowering blood pressure.110 And the more plants, perhaps, the better. Meat-free diets 
in general “confer protection against cardiovascular diseases … some cancers and 
total mortality,” but completely plant-based diets “seem to offer additional protection 
for obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality.”111 
There appears to be a stepwise drop in hypertension rates the more plant-based 
foods you eat. Based on the same study of eighty-nine thousand Californians featured 
in chapter 6, compared with people who eat meat more than once a week, flexitarians 
(those who eat less meat, perhaps a few times a month) had 23 percent lower rates of 
high blood pressure. Those who cut out all meat except for fish had a 38 percent 
lower risk of high blood pressure, and those who cut out all meat had a 55 percent 
lower rate. People who cut out all meat, eggs, and dairy did the best, with a 75 
percent reduced risk of high blood pressure. Those eating completely plant-based 
diets appeared to have thrown three-quarters of their risk for developing this major 
killer out the window.112 
When scientists looked at diabetes and body weight, they found the same apparent 
progressive improvements as consumption of animal products decreased and plant 
foods increased. Those eating plant-based diets had just a fraction of the diabetes 
risk even after factoring out the weight benefits,113 but what about hypertension? On 
average, those who eat completely plant-based foods are about thirty pounds lighter 
than those eating conventional diets.114 Maybe they have such great blood pressure 
just because they’re so much thinner? In other words, do omnivores who are as slim 
as vegans enjoy the same blood pressure? 
To answer this question, researchers would have to find a group of individuals 
who eat the standard American diet but are also as thin as people eating plant-based 
diets. To find an omnivorous group that fit and trim, researchers recruited long- 
distance endurance athletes who had run, on average, forty-eight miles per week for 
twenty-one years. Running almost two marathons a week for twenty years, pretty 
much anyone can become as slim as a plant eater no matter what they eat! The 
researchers then compared these hard-core athletes to two groups: sedentary meat 
eaters who exercised less than an hour per week and sedentary vegans who ate 
mostly unprocessed, uncooked plant foods. 
How did the numbers come out? Not surprisingly, the endurance runners on a 
standard American diet had a better blood pressure average than their sedentary, 
meat-eating counterparts: 122/72 compared with 132/79, which fits the definition of 
prehypertensive. But the sedentary vegans? They averaged an extraordinary 
104/62.115 Apparently, eating standard American fare even when running two 
thousand miles a year may not bring down your blood pressure as low as a being a 
couch-potato vegan. 
Foods for Additional Hypertension Protection 
A low-sodium diet centered around whole plant foods appears to be the best way to 
bring down high blood pressure. What if you’re already eating this way but that 
110/70 still eludes you? There are a few foods in particular you can try that may 
offer additional protection. 
I’ve already touched on whole grains and will go into detail about flaxseeds, 
hibiscus tea, and nitrate-rich vegetables. Ground flaxseeds alone “induced one of the 
most potent blood-pressure-lowering effects ever achieved by a dietary 
intervention.”116 Eating just a few tablespoons a day appears to be two to three times 
more powerful than adopting an aerobic endurance exercise program117 (not that you 
shouldn’t do both—incorporate flaxseeds into your diet and exercise). 
Consumption of both raw and cooked vegetables is associated with lower blood 
pressure, but raw veggies may be slightly more protective.118 Studies have also found 
that loading up on beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils may help a little,119 so add 
those to your shopping list. Red wine may help, but only nonalcoholic brands. Only 
wine that has had the alcohol removed appears to lower blood pressure.120 
Watermelon appears to offer protection, which is great (and delicious) news, but 
you may have to eat about two pounds of it per day to achieve an effect.121 Kiwifruits 
flopped, though. In a study funded by a kiwifruit company, kiwi failed to offer any 
protection.122 Perhaps the kiwi industry should take a cue from the California Raisin 
Marketing Board, which funded a study designed to show that raisins can reduce 
blood pressure. To inflate the benefits of raisins, they used junk food as the control 
group. So the study found raisins may lower blood pressure, but only, apparently, 
compared to fudge cookies, Cheez-Its, and Chips Ahoy!123 
Flaxseed 
In chapters 11 and 13, we will see how effective flaxseeds can be against breast and 
prostate cancers, but you have to be a little skeptical when scientists throw around 
words like “miraculous” to describe them. (One medical journal published a review 
titled “Flaxseed: A Miraculous Defense Against Some Critical Maladies.”) 124 But a 
remarkable intervention trial published in the journal Hypertension suggests that in 
this case, the term “miraculous” may not be too far off. 
Rarely does one see a dietary study of this caliber: It was a prospective, double- 
blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. That’s hard to pull off with food. With a 
drug trial, a blinded study is easy: Researchers give someone a sugar pill that looks 
identical to the drug, so that neither the study subject nor the person giving the pill 
knows which one is which (hence, double-blind). But how do you do that with food? 
People tend to notice if you try to sneak a quarter cup of ground flaxseed into their 
lunch. 
The researchers tried a clever tactic to overcome this problem. They created a 
number of recipes for common foods including muffins and pasta in which they could 
disguise placebo ingredients like bran and molasses to match the texture and color of 
the flax-laden foods. This way, they could randomize people into two groups and 
secretly introduce tablespoons of daily ground flaxseeds into the diets of half the 
participants to see if it made any difference. 
After six months, those who ate the placebo foods started out hypertensive and 
stayed hypertensive, despite the fact that many of them were on a variety of blood 
pressure pills. On average, they started the study at 155/81 and ended it at 158/81. 
What about the hypertensives who were unknowingly eating flaxseeds every day? 
Their blood pressure dropped from 158/82 down to 143/75. A seven-point drop in 
diastolic blood pressure may not sound like a lot, but that would be expected to result 
in 46 percent fewer strokes and 29 percent less heart disease over time.125 
How does that result compare with taking drugs? The flaxseeds managed to drop 
subjects’ systolic and diastolic blood pressure by up to fifteen and seven points, 
respectively. Compare that result to the effect of powerful antihypertensive drugs, 
such as calcium-channel blockers (for example, Norvasc, Cardizem, Procardia), 
which have been found to reduce blood pressure by only eight and three points, 
respectively, or to ACE inhibitors (such as Vasotec, Lotensin, Zestril, Altace), which 
drop patients’ blood pressure by only five and two points, respectively. 126 Ground 
flaxseeds may work two to three times better than these medicines, and they have 
only good side effects. In addition to their anticancer properties, flaxseeds have been 
demonstrated in clinical studies to help control cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood 
sugar levels; reduce inflammation, and successfully treat constipation.127 
Hibiscus Tea for Hypertension 
Hibiscus tea, derived from the flower of the same name, is also known as roselle, 
sorrel, jamaica, or sour tea. With a distinct tart, cranberry-like flavor and bright red 
color, this herbal tea is served and enjoyed both hot and cold around the world. In a 
comparison of the antioxidant content of 280 common beverages, hibiscus ranked 
number-one, beating out other heavyweights, including the oft-lauded green tea.128 
Within an hour of consumption, the antioxidant power of your bloodstream shoots up, 
demonstrating that the antioxidant phytonutrients in the tea are absorbed into your 
system.129 What effects might this infusion have on your health? 
Unfortunately, efficacy against obesity has been disappointing. After giving 
hibiscus tea to overweight individuals for months, researchers have only been able to 
show about an extra half pound of weight loss per month over a placebo.130 Early 
studies on cholesterol-lowering effects looked promising, suggesting that drinking 
two cups of hibiscus tea a day for a month may provide as much as an 8 percent drop 
in cholesterol,131 but when all such studies were put together, the results were pretty 
much a wash.132 This may be because, for some reason, hibiscus tea only seemed to 
have an effect on about half the study subjects. If you’re in the lucky half, you may be 
able to get as much as a 12 percent drop in cholesterol.133 
But high blood pressure is where hibiscus really shines.134 A double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study out of Tufts University that compared hibiscus tea with an 
artificially colored and flavored lookalike showed that three cups of hibiscus tea a 
day significantly lowered blood pressure in prehypertensive adults better than the 
placebo beverage.135 But by how much? How does drinking hibiscus tea compare 
with other interventions? 
The PREMIER Clinical Trial randomized hundreds of men and women with 
elevated blood pressure into an “advice only” control group or an active lifestyle 
intervention group. The control group was given a brochure and told to lose weight, 
reduce their salt intake, get more exercise, and eat healthier (i.e., to go on the DASH 
diet). The behavioral intervention group received the same instruction but also got 
face-to-face sessions, attended group meetings, kept food diaries, and monitored their 
physical activity, calories, and sodium intake. Within six months, the intervention 
group achieved a four-point drop in systolic blood pressure compared with the 
advice-only group. That may not seem like a lot, but on a population scale, a five- 
point drop may lead to 14 percent fewer stroke deaths, 9 percent fewer fatal heart 
attacks, and 7 percent fewer deaths overall each year.136 Meanwhile, in the Tufts 
study, a cup of hibiscus tea with each meal managed to lower subjects’ systolic 
blood pressure by six points over the control group.137 
To lower blood pressure, you should still lose weight, reduce your salt intake, get 
more exercise, and eat healthier, but the evidence shows that adding hibiscus tea to 
your daily routine may offer an additional benefit, comparable even to that provided 
by antihypertensive drugs. Tested head-to-head against a leading blood pressure 
drug, two cups of strong hibiscus tea every morning (using a total of five tea bags) 
was as effective in lowering subjects’ blood pressure as a starting dose of the drug 
Captopril taken twice a day.138 
However, there are differences: Captopril can have side effects, most commonly 
rash, cough, and taste impairment, and it can even, though extremely rarely, cause 
fatal swelling of the throat.139 No side effects were reported for hibiscus tea, though 
it isn’t called sour tea for nothing. If you drink it, make sure to rinse your mouth with 
water afterward to keep the natural acids in the tea from softening the enamel on your 
teeth.140 And given the extraordinary manganese content in hibiscus tea,141 to be on 
the safe side, I wouldn’t recommend drinking more than a quart of it a day. 
The Power of NO 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a key biological messenger within the body, and its message is: 
“Open Sesame!” When released by your endothelium (the cells lining your arteries), 
it signals the muscle fibers within the walls of your arteries to relax, allowing them 
to open up and for more blood to flow. That’s how nitroglycerin pills work: The 
nitroglycerin people take when they’re experiencing chest pain is converted into NO, 
which dilates the coronary arteries, allowing more blood to flow to the heart muscle. 
Erectile dysfunction (ED) pills like Viagra work the same way; they boost nitric 
oxide signaling, which relaxes penile arteries and improves blood flow to the penis. 
The ED you really need to be concerned about, though, is endothelial dysfunction, 
the failure of the linings of your arteries to produce enough NO to properly dilate 
them. Nitric oxide is produced by an enzyme called NO synthase. Its enemy is free 
radicals, which not only gobble up nitric oxide but can hijack NO synthase and force 
it to start pumping out additional free radicals.142 Without enough NO, your arteries 
can then stiffen, become dysfunctional, and raise your blood pressure and your risk 
for heart attack. 
So you need to flood your body with antioxidant-rich plant foods throughout the 
day to extinguish the free radicals and let NO synthase get back to its job of keeping 
your arteries fully functional. There’s an ultrasound device researchers use to 
measure the NO-induced dilation of your arteries. One study using this device found 
that if you take people following a standard Western diet and have them eat even 
fewer antioxidants, their artery dilation only gets a little bit worse. It seems we’re 
already near the bottom of the barrel arterial-function-wise, so there’s not much room 
for further decline. But put people on a high-antioxidant diet by, among many other 
things, switching their bananas for berries and their white chocolate for dark, and 
within just two weeks, they experience a significant boost in their arteries’ ability to 
relax and dilate normally.143 
In addition to eating antioxidant-rich foods that can boost your body’s ability to 
produce NO, you can also eat certain vegetables, such as beets and greens, that are 
rich in natural nitrates, which your body can convert into nitric oxide. (For the 
difference between nitrates and nitrites, see chapter 10.) This process explains why 
researchers have been able to show a ten-point systolic blood pressure drop in 
volunteers within hours of their consuming beet juice—an effect that lasted 
throughout the day.144 
That study was performed on a group of healthy subjects, though. Obviously, we 
need to test the power of beets where it counts most—in people with high blood 
pressure. If nitrate-rich vegetables can so powerfully modulate humanity’s leading 
risk factor for dying, why did it take until 2015 before such a study was published? 
Well, who was going to fund it? Big Beet? Drug companies rake in more than $10 
billion a year from blood pressure medications.145 You can’t make billions on beets. 
That’s why we are fortunate to have charities like the British Heart Foundation, 
which finally funded a beet juice study involving people with high blood pressure. 
Half the subjects were provided a cup of beet juice daily for four weeks, while 
the other half was given an indistinguishable, nitrate-free placebo drink. The 
researchers found that not only was systolic blood pressure reduced by about eight 
points in the beet-juice drinkers but the benefits grew week by week, suggesting their 
blood pressure might have continued to improve even further. The scientists 
concluded that “nitrate-rich vegetables may prove to be both cost-effective, 
affordable, and favorable for a public health approach to hypertension.”146 
The optimal dose appears to be one-half cup,147 but beet juice is perishable, 
processed, and hard to find. A typical fifteen-ounce can of beets would provide the 
same dose of nitrate, but the most concentrated sources of the compound are dark- 
green, leafy vegetables. The following is a top-ten list of nitrate-rich foods, in 
ascending order. As you’ll see, eight out of the top ten are greens. 
TOP-TEN FOOD SOURCES OF NITRATES 
10. Beets 
  9. Swiss chard 
  8. Oak leaf lettuce 
  7. Beet greens 
  6. Basil 
  5. Mesclun greens 
  4. Butter leaf lettuce 
  3. Cilantro 
  2. Rhubarb 
  1. Arugula 
Arugula comes out on top with a whopping 480 mg of nitrate per hundred-gram 
serving, which is more than four times the content of beets.148 
The healthiest way to get your nitrate fix is to eat a big salad every day. You 
could take nitrate- and nitric-oxide-boosting supplements, but they have questionable 
safety149 and efficacy150 records and should be avoided. What about V8 juice, which 
boasts both beet and spinach juice? It must not have much, because you’d have to 
drink nineteen quarts of it a day to reach your daily nitrate intake target.151 
The benefits of nitrates may explain why eating your greens is associated with 
reduced rates of heart disease152 and a longer life span,153 not to mention the “veggie 
Viagra” effect. You read that right. There’s a link between vegetable consumption 
and improved sexual function,154 as well as improved blood flow to the most 
important organ of the body, the brain.155 And the only side effect of beeting your 
brains out may be a little extra color in your life—namely, red stools and urine that is 
pretty in pee-nk. 
Doping with Beet Juice 
A Lamborghini goes faster than a lemon not because the chemistry of gasoline 
combustion is somehow different in a sports car from that in a beater. It’s because the 
Lambo has a more powerful engine. Similarly, athletes may have bigger muscles and 
be able to get more oxygen to those muscles faster. But fundamentally, the amount of 
energy a body can extract from oxygen remains the same … or so we thought. 
About five years ago, one of the gospels of sports physiology got turned on its 
head—all because of beet juice. 
Nitrates, concentrated in green, leafy vegetables and beets, not only help deliver 
oxygenated blood to your muscles by helping dilate your arteries but also enable your 
body to extract more energy from that oxygen—something never before thought 
possible. For example, one little shot of beet juice has been found to allow free 
divers to hold their breath for a half minute longer than usual.156 After sipping beet 
juice, cyclists were able to perform at the same level of intensity while consuming 19 
percent less oxygen than the placebo group. Then, when they ramped up their bike 
resistance for an intense bout of what they called “severe cycling,” the time to 
exhaustion was extended from 9:43 minutes to 11:15 minutes. The beet-juice- 
drinking group exhibited greater endurance while using less oxygen. In short, the beet 
juice made the bikers’ bodies’ energy production significantly more efficient. No 
drug, steroid, supplement, or intervention had ever before been shown to do what 
beet juice could do.157 
This effect works with whole beets too. In another study, men and women eating 
one and a half cups of baked beets seventy-five minutes before running a 5K race 
improved their running performance while maintaining the same heart rate and even 
reported less exertion.158 Faster time with less effort? Them’s some block-rockin’ 
beets! 
To maximize athletic performance, the ideal dose and timing appears to be a half 
cup of beet juice (or three three-inch beets, or a cup of cooked spinach159) two to 
three hours before a competition.160 
It seems sports news programs are always talking about steroids and other illegal 
performance-enhancing drugs. Why hasn’t anyone mentioned these mighty and 
perfectly legit performance-enhancing vegetables? Beets me. 
A blood pressure checkup is easy to ignore or postpone. Unlike the case with 
many of our other leading killers, the insidious consequences of hypertension may not 
be apparent until you’re lifted into an ambulance or lowered into a grave. So go to 
your local pharmacy, fire station, or doctor’s office and get your blood pressure 
checked. If it’s too high, the bad news is that you’ll join the one billion people living 
with this condition. The good news is that you don’t have to join the millions who 
die from it every year. Try eating and living healthfully for even just a few weeks, 
and you may be amazed by the results. Here are just a few stories about people who 
did just that. 
Every day, NutritionFacts.org gets hundreds of e-mails, many from people eager 
to share how their lives were turned around by taking their health into their own 
hands. There’s Bob, for example, who once weighed 230 pounds and had a 200-plus 
cholesterol level and triglycerides through the roof. He was on a battery of blood 
pressure medications. After starting a whole-food, plant-based diet, he’s now down 
to 175 pounds, boasts a total cholesterol of 136, and no longer takes any blood 
pressure meds. At sixty-five, Bob feels better now than he has in decades, not by 
trying a new exercise program or the latest blockbuster drug—just by changing his 
diet. 
Patricia e-mailed not long ago. Her brother had just been diagnosed with severe 
high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. He was nearly sixty pounds overweight, and 
his skin was the color of “white paper.” He was so unhealthy he couldn’t even get a 
driver’s license. Patricia and her brother decided to start a plant-based diet together. 
Now he’s fit and trim, his weight is normal, he has no more need for blood pressure 
drugs, and Patricia most deservedly takes the (sugar-, milk-, and egg-free) cake for 
best sister ever. 
Then there’s Dean. He “filled up” with the standard American diet and became 
obese. He had high blood pressure, so his doctor put him on meds. Then he got high 
cholesterol, so his doctor put him on more meds. Moreover, every winter, Dean 
would suffer from terrible respiratory infections that required antibiotics. Finally, he 
got fed up and adopted a plant-based diet. He’s now lost fifty pounds. His blood 
sugar and cholesterol levels, and even his blood pressure, are all normal. And he 
happily spends his winters ailment-free. Dean ended his note to me with this simple 
pledge: “I will be on a plant-based diet for the rest of my life.” Thanks to a healthy 
diet, that may be quite a long time. 
 CHAPTER 8 
How Not to Die from Liver Diseases 
There are some patients you never forget. On the first day of my GI rotation (GI 
stands for gastrointestinal, which means I was about to come face-to-face with any 
issues in the digestive tract from mouth to tush), I reported in and was told to go 
observe my team of senior doctors in one of the endoscopy rooms, where physicians 
use a scope to look into the GI tract for all manner of routine procedures. I expected 
to walk into a colonoscopy looking at a rectal polyp or maybe an upper endoscopy 
looking at a stomach ulcer. But I’ll never forget what I saw. It fuels me to this day in 
my mission to help people understand the connection between lifestyle and health (or 
lack of it). 
A sedated patient was lying on a gurney, surrounded by a team of doctors using a 
scope with a camera. I looked at the monitor, trying to find anatomical landmarks to 
understand where the scope was. It was definitely down the throat, but the esophagus 
was snaked with what looked like throbbing varicose veins. They were everywhere. 
They looked like worms trying to emerge from under the smooth surface of the 
esophagus. Several had eroded through the lining and were spurting blood. I watched 
as more blood surged out with every one of the patient’s heartbeats. She was 
basically bleeding to death into her stomach. The doctors tried desperately to 
cauterize and tie off these fountains of fresh red blood, but it was like a game of 
Whack-A-Mole. Every time one was cut off, another sprang up. 
These were known as esophageal varices—veins swollen with backed-up blood 
due to a cirrhotic liver. Watching this nightmare unfold, I wondered how the patient 
first came down with cirrhosis. Was she an alcoholic? Did she contract hepatitis? I 
remember thinking how devastated she must have felt when she found out she had 
end-stage liver disease. How was her family coping? I was jerked back from my 
thoughts by screeching monitor alarms. She was bleeding out. 
The doctors couldn’t transfuse blood faster than the patient was losing it 
internally. Her blood pressure fell, and her heart stopped. The staff jumped into 
action with chest compressions, paddles delivering shocks, and injections of 
adrenaline, but within minutes, she was gone. 
It was my job to talk to the patient’s family. I learned that her cirrhosis was not 
due to drinking too much or from being an IV drug user. Her liver had scarred over 
because she was obese and had developed a fatty liver. Everything I had just 
witnessed was preventable, a direct result of lifestyle choices. When people are 
overweight, they can suffer from social stigma, knee problems, and increased risk for 
metabolic disorders like diabetes, but this was the first person I saw bleed to death 
before my eyes. 
The family cried. I cried. I swore to myself I’d do whatever was necessary to 
help prevent this from ever happening to anyone under my care.

You can make do with only one kidney. You can survive without a spleen or a 
gallbladder. You can even get by without a stomach. But you can’t live without a 
liver, the body’s largest internal organ. 
What exactly does the liver do? Up to five hundred different functions have been 
attributed to this vital organ.1 First and foremost, it plays the role of bouncer, keeping 
unwanted guests out of your bloodstream. Whatever you absorb through your 
digestive tract isn’t immediately circulated throughout your body. The blood from 
your intestines first goes straight to the liver, where nutrients are metabolized and 
toxins are neutralized. It’s no surprise, then, that what you eat can and does play a 
critical role in liver health and disease. 
About sixty thousand Americans die of liver disease every year, and the death 
rates have risen each of the last five years.2 The incidence of liver cancer alone has 
been rising about 4 percent every year over the last decade.3 Liver dysfunction can 
run in families, like the iron-overload disease hemochromatosis. It can be caused by 
infections that can lead to liver cancer, or it can stem from drugs—most often 
inadvertent or intentional overdoses of Tylenol.4 The most common causes, however, 
are drink and food: alcoholic liver disease and fatty liver disease. 
ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE 
According to a famous series of papers in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association called the “Actual Causes of Death in the United States” [emphasis 
added], the leading killer of Americans in the year 2000 was tobacco, followed by 
diet and inactivity. The third-leading killer? Alcohol.5 About half of alcohol-related 
deaths were due to sudden causes like motor vehicle accidents; the other half were 
slower, and the leading cause was alcoholic liver disease.6 
Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to an accumulation of fat in the liver 
(what’s known as fatty liver), which can cause inflammation and result in liver 
scarring and, eventually, liver failure. The CDC defines excessive drinking as the 
regular consumption of more than one drink a day for women and more than two a 
day for men. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 8 ounces of malt liquor, 5 
ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces (a “shot”) of hard liquor.7 Progression of the disease 
can usually be halted by stopping drinking, but sometimes it’s too late.8 
Heavy alcohol consumption can cause a fatty liver in less than three weeks,9 but it 
usually resolves within four to six weeks after stopping drinking.10 But in 5–15 
percent of cases, the disease continues to progress, and the liver starts to scar despite 
alcohol cessation.11 
Similarly, once alcohol-induced hepatitis (liver inflammation) is diagnosed, 
three-year survival rates can be as high as 90 percent among people who stop 
drinking after diagnosis.12 But as many as 18 percent of them go on to develop 
cirrhosis, an irreparable scarring of the liver.13 
The best strategy to avoid alcoholic liver disease is to not drink so much in the 
first place. But if you do drink excessively, help is available. Though most people 
who drink may not be alcoholics,14 there is convincing evidence that twelve-step 
programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous can be effective for those who do suffer 
from alcohol dependence.15 
Isn’t Moderate Drinking Beneficial? 
Everyone agrees that heavy drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and binge drinking 
are bad ideas, but what about “moderate” drinking? Yes, excessive drinkers appear 
to significantly shorten their lives, but so can teetotalers.16 While smoking is bad for 
you and smoking a lot is worse, that logic may not hold for alcohol consumption. 
There actually appears to be a beneficial effect on overall mortality by drinking some 
alcohol—but only, it seems, for those who are not taking good care of themselves 
already.17 
Moderate drinking does appear to protect against heart disease, perhaps because 
of a blood-thinning effect,18 but even light drinking (less than one drink a day) has 
been found to increase cancer risk, as you’ll see in chapter 11. How could something 
that increases cancer risk still prolong life? Cancer is “only” our second-leading 
killer disease. Because heart disease is the leading cause of death, it explains why 
people who drink moderately may live longer lives than those who abstain. But this 
advantage may be restricted only to those who fail to practice a bare modicum of 
healthy behaviors.19 
To find out who might benefit from moderate alcohol consumption, researchers 
recruited close to ten thousand men and women and followed them for seventeen 
years after assessing their drinking and lifestyle habits. The results were published in 
a paper entitled “Who Benefits Most from the Cardioprotective Properties of 
Alcohol Consumption—Health Freaks or Couch Potatoes?” What constituted a 
“health freak”? According to the researchers’ definition, anyone who exercises thirty 
minutes a day, doesn’t smoke, and eats at least one serving of fruits or vegetables 
daily.20 (What does that say about our current diets if eating a single apple means 
you’re a “health freak”?) 
One to two drinks a day did lower the risk of heart disease for the “couch 
potatoes,” those living unhealthy lifestyles. But people who practiced even the bare 
minimum of healthy behaviors showed no benefit from alcohol. The lesson: Grapes, 
barley, and potatoes are best eaten in their nondistilled form, and Johnnie Walker is 
no substitute for actual walking. 
NONALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE 
The most common cause of a fatty liver is not alcohol but nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD). You may remember the blockbuster documentary Super Size Me, 
in which the film’s director, Morgan Spurlock, ate exclusively at McDonald’s for a 
month. Predictably, Spurlock’s weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol all went up— 
but so did his liver enzymes. That was a sign that his liver cells were dying and 
spilling their contents into his bloodstream. How was his diet causing liver damage? 
Let’s put it this way: He was beginning to turn his liver into human foie gras (fatty 
liver pâté). 
Some critics wrote off the film as overly sensational, but researchers in Sweden 
took it seriously enough to formally replicate Spurlock’s one-man experiment. In 
their study, a group of men and women agreed to eat two fast-food meals a day. At 
the start, their liver enzyme levels were normal, but after just one week of this diet, 
more than 75 percent of the volunteers’ liver function test results became 
pathological.21 If an unhealthy diet can cause liver damage within just seven days, it 
should be no surprise that NAFLD has quietly become the most common cause of 
chronic liver disease in the United States, afflicting an estimated seventy million 
people.22 That’s about one in three adults. Nearly 100 percent of those with severe 
obesity may be affected.23 
Like alcoholic fatty liver, NAFLD starts with a buildup of fat deposits in the liver 
that cause no symptoms. In rare cases, this can progress to inflammation and, over 
years, end up scarring the liver into a state of cirrhosis, resulting in liver cancer, 
liver failure, and even death—as I saw in that endoscopy suite.24 
Fast food is so effective at instigating the disease because NAFLD is associated 
with the intake of soft drinks and meat. Drinking just one can of soda a day appears to 
raise the odds of getting fatty liver disease by 45 percent.25 Meanwhile, those who 
eat the meat equivalent of fourteen chicken nuggets or more daily have nearly triple 
the rate of fatty liver disease compared to people who eat seven nuggets’ worth or 
less.26 
NAFLD has been characterized as a “tale of fat and sugar,”27 but not all fat affects 
the liver similarly. People suffering from fatty liver inflammation were found to be 
consuming more animal fat (and cholesterol) but less plant fat (and fiber and 
antioxidants).28 This may explain why adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet with 
plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans has been associated with less 
severe fatty liver disease even though it is not typically a low-fat diet.29 
NAFLD may also be caused by cholesterol overload.30 The dietary cholesterol 
found in eggs, meat, and dairy can become oxidized and then set off a chain reaction 
that results in excess fat in the liver.31 When the concentration of cholesterol in your 
liver cells gets too high, it can crystallize like rock candy and result in inflammation. 
This process is similar to the way uric acid crystals cause gout (as we’ll see in 
chapter 10).32 Your white blood cells try to engulf the cholesterol crystals but then 
die in the process, spilling out inflammatory compounds. This may explain how 
benign fatty liver cases can turn into serious hepatitis.33 
To explore the relationship between diet and serious liver disease, about nine 
thousand American adults were studied for thirteen years. The researchers noted that 
their most important finding may be that cholesterol consumption was a strong 
predictor of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Those consuming the amount of cholesterol 
found in two Egg McMuffins34 or more each day appeared to double their risk of 
hospitalization or death.35 
Your best bet for avoiding NAFLD, the most common cause of liver disease, may 
be to avoid excess calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar. 
VIRAL HEPATITIS 
Another common cause of liver disease is viral hepatitis, which is triggered by one 
or more of five different viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. The mode of 
transmission and prognosis differs for each of these viruses. Hepatitis A is spread 
primarily through food or water that is tainted with contaminated feces. It can be 
prevented through vaccination, avoiding raw and undercooked shellfish, and trying to 
ensure that everyone who handles your food washes their hands after changing 
diapers or using the toilet. 
While hepatitis A virus is foodborne, hepatitis B virus is bloodborne and is 
transmitted sexually. As with hepatitis A, an effective vaccine is available against 
hepatitis B that every child should get. Hepatitis D virus infection can only occur in 
someone who is already infected with hepatitis B and so can be prevented by 
preventing hepatitis B. So get vaccinated and refrain from intravenous drug use and 
unsafe sex. 
Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine for the hepatitis C virus, the most 
dreaded of liver viruses. Exposure can lead to a chronic infection that, over decades, 
can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Hepatitis C is now the leading cause of liver 
transplants.36 
Chlorella and Hepatitis C 
The green algae chlorella looks promising for the treatment of hepatitis C. A 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that about two teaspoons a 
day of chlorella boosted the activity of natural killer cells in participants’ bodies, 
which can naturally kill hepatitis C-infected cells.37 A clinical study of hepatitis-C 
patients found that chlorella supplementation may lower the level of liver 
inflammation, but the study was small and uncontrolled.38 
There is a desperate need for alternative treatments for hepatitis C, as older, less 
expensive therapies frequently fail due to their unbearable side effects, whereas 
newer, more tolerable drugs cost as much as $1,000 per pill.39 Chlorella may help as 
an adjunct (additional) therapy or for those who can’t tolerate or afford conventional 
antiviral therapy but may not be without risk (see here). 
Hepatitis C is transmitted via blood, usually through sharing needles rather than 
via blood transfusions, now that the blood supply is screened for the virus. However, 
sharing personal-care items that can be contaminated with trace amounts of blood, 
such as toothbrushes and razors, may also present a risk.40 
Although a case was once reported involving a woman who contracted hepatitis C 
from sharing a supermarket meat slicer with an infected coworker,41 the virus would 
not naturally be present in the meat itself, as humans and chimpanzees are the only 
animals who appear susceptible to it. 
The same cannot be said for hepatitis E virus. 
Preventing Hepatitis E Through Diet 
As one of the CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis laboratory chiefs explained in a 
paper entitled “Much Meat, Much Malady: Changing Perceptions of the 
Epidemiology of Hepatitis E,” hepatitis E virus is now considered a zoonotic 
disease, able to spread from animals to humans, and pigs may be the primary viral 
reservoir.42 
The shift in thinking began in 2003, when researchers in Japan linked the hepatitis 
E virus (HEV) with the consumption of grilled pork liver. After testing pig livers 
from Japanese grocery stores, the researchers determined that nearly 2 percent of the 
meat tested positive for HEV.43 In the United States, it was even worse: 11 percent of 
commercial pig livers purchased from grocery stores were contaminated with 
HEV.44 
That’s alarming, but how many people really eat pig livers? What about plain old 
pork? 
Unfortunately, pork may harbor HEV as well. Experts suspect that much of the 
American population has been exposed to this virus, as there is known to be a 
relatively high prevalence of HEV antibodies among U.S. blood donors. This 
exposure may be a result of individuals consuming HEV-contaminated pork.45 
So do more people die of liver disease in countries where pork is more popular? 
It appears so. The relationship between national per capita pork consumption and 
deaths from liver disease correlates as tightly as per capita alcohol consumption and 
liver fatalities. Each pork chop consumed per capita may be associated with about 
two beers’ worth of increased liver mortality risk on a countrywide scale.46 
Aren’t viruses deactivated by cooking? Usually, but there’s always the problem of 
cross-contaminating your hands or kitchen surfaces while handling raw meat. Once 
meat is in the oven, most foodborne pathogens can be destroyed by cooking the meat 
to proper internal cooking temperatures, with an emphasis on proper. Researchers at 
the National Institute of Health subjected the hepatitis E virus to various levels of 
heat and found that HEV can survive the internal temperature of meat cooked rare.47 
So if you cook pork, invest in a meat thermometer and make sure to follow proper 
handling techniques, including washing kitchen surfaces with a bleach solution.48 
Though most people who develop hepatitis E recover completely, it can be 
deadly for pregnant women: The risk of death during the third trimester can reach as 
high as 30 percent.49 If you are pregnant, please be especially careful about pork 
preparation. And if there are people in the household who like their pork pink in the 
middle, they should be sure to wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom. 
Weight-Loss Supplements and Liver Disease 
We’ve all seen those marketing schemes involving products espousing all sorts of 
health claims. And given the pyramid-like multilevel structure of those types of 
distribution programs—you earn money by selling products and also for recruiting 
others to sell—word can spread pretty fast, which is particularly troubling when PR 
outruns the truth. 
Indeed, while the vast majority of drug-induced liver injuries are caused by 
conventional medications, liver damage caused by certain classes of dietary 
supplements can be even more serious and may lead to higher rates of liver 
transplants and death.50 Multilevel marketers of products later linked to toxic 
reactions (such as noni juice51 and Herbalife52) have pointed to scientific studies to 
support their health claims. However, a public health review found that such studies 
often seemed “deliberately created for marketing purposes” and were presented in 
such a way as to appear “designed to mislead potential consumers.” Often, multilevel 
marketing study researchers didn’t disclose their funding sources, but a little 
detective work can expose a web of financial conflicts of interest.53 
These suspect studies were the same ones cited to provide proof of safety for 
their products. For example, a multilevel marketing company that sells mangosteen 
juice cited a study they paid for to support its assertion that their product is “safe for 
everyone.” The study involved exposing just thirty people to their product with 
another ten people given a placebo. With so few people tested, the stuff could 
literally kill 1 or 2 percent of users and you wouldn’t know.54 
A study that the multilevel marketing company behind a supplement called 
Metabolife cited for safety placed thirty-five people on the stuff.55 Metabolife has 
since been withdrawn from the market after being linked to heart attacks, strokes, 
seizures, and deaths.56 Hydroxycitric acid, a component of such products as 
Hydroxycut, was studied on forty people.57 No serious adverse effects were found, 
but the story ended the same way: Hydroxycut was withdrawn after dozens of 
verified cases of organ damage were brought to light—including massive liver 
failure requiring transplantation and even death.58 Until the multibillion-dollar herbal 
supplement industry is better regulated, you’re better off saving your money—and 
your health—by sticking to real food. 
PROTECTING THE LIVER AT BREAKFAST 
Specific plant foods have been found to be protective of the liver. For instance, 
starting out the day with a bowl of oatmeal and (surprisingly) coffee may help 
safeguard our liver function. 
Oatmeal 
In numerous population studies, consumption of whole grains has been associated 
with reduced risk for a range of chronic diseases,59 but it’s hard to tease out whether 
eating whole grains may just be a marker for a healthier lifestyle in general. For 
example, people who eat whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat, and brown 
rice, also tend to be more physically active, smoke less, and eat more fruits, 
vegetables, and dietary fiber60 than those who might prefer a breakfast of Froot 
Loops, for example. No wonder the former group may have lower disease risk. 
Fortunately, researchers can control for these factors, effectively comparing 
nonsmokers only to nonsmokers with similar diet and exercise habits. When that’s 
done, whole grains still appear to be protective.61 
In other words, the evidence seems clear that oatmeal eaters may have lower rates 
of disease, but that’s not the same as showing that if you start eating more oatmeal, 
your risk will drop. To prove cause and effect, we need to put it to the test by 
performing an interventional trial: Change people’s diets and see what happens. 
Ideally, researchers would randomly split people into two groups and give half of 
them oatmeal and the other half a placebo—a fake, similar-tasting and -looking 
oatmeal. Neither the study subjects nor the researchers themselves can know who’s 
in which group until the end. This robust, double-blind method is easy to use when 
studying drugs, as you just give people a sugar pill that looks like the drug in 
question. As we’ve discussed, it’s not as easy to make placebo food. 
But in 2013, a group of researchers published the first double-blinded, 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oatmeal in overweight men and women.62 
They found a significant reduction in liver inflammation in the real oatmeal group, but 
that may have been because they lost so much more weight than the controls (that is, 
the placebo-oatmeal eaters). Nearly 90 percent of the real-oatmeal-treated subjects 
had lost weight, compared with no weight loss, on average, among the control group. 
So it may be that the benefits of whole grains on liver function are indirect.63 A 
follow-up study in 2014 helped confirm the findings of a protective role for whole 
grains in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients in reducing the risk of liver inflammation. 
In this study, refined grain consumption was associated with increased risk of the 
disease.64 So lay off the Wonder Bread and stick to truly wonderful whole-grain 
foods, including oatmeal. 
Making Your Own Whole-Cranberry Cocktail 
A specific class of plant compounds called anthocyanins—the purple, red, and blue 
pigments in such plants as berries, grapes, plums, red cabbage, and red onions—have 
been found to prevent fat accumulation in human liver cells in in vitro studies.65 A 
single confirmatory clinical (human) trial has been published in which a purple sweet 
potato concoction successfully dampened liver inflammation better than a placebo.66 
When it came to suppressing the growth of human liver cancer cells in a petri 
dish,67 cranberries beat out the other most common fruits in the United States: apples, 
bananas, grapefruits, grapes, lemons, oranges, peaches, pears, pineapples, and 
strawberries. Other studies have found that cranberries are also effective in vitro 
against additional cancers, including those of the brain,68 breast,69 colon,70 lung,71 
mouth,72 ovary,73 prostate,74 and stomach.75 Unfortunately, there have yet to be 
clinical studies of the effects of cranberries on cancer patients that confirm these 
findings. 
Moreover, to the drug industry’s chagrin, scientists have been unable to pin down 
the active ingredients involved in cranberries’ special effects. Extracts concentrating 
individual components fail to match the anticancer effects of the cranberry as a 
whole,76 which of course can’t be patented. More proof that it’s nearly always best 
to give preference to whole foods. 
How do you do that with cranberries, though, since they’re so tart? 
It’s not easy at the grocery store. Ninety-five percent of cranberries are sold in the 
form of processed products, such as juices and sauces.77 In fact, to get the same 
amount of anthocyanins found in a single cup of fresh or frozen cranberries, you’d 
have to drink sixteen cups of cranberry juice cocktail, eat seven cups of dried 
cranberries, or make your way through twenty-six cans of cranberry sauce.78 The 
ruby-red phytonutrient found in cranberries is a powerful antioxidant, but the high- 
fructose corn syrup added to cranberry cocktail acts as a pro-oxidant, canceling out 
some of the benefit.79 
Here’s a simple recipe for a whole-food version of a tasty cranberry beverage, 
what I call my Pink Juice: 
  
1 handful fresh or frozen cranberries 
2 cups water 
8 teaspoons erythritol (a naturally derived low-calorie sweetener; read more 
about erythritol and other sweeteners in part 2) 
Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend at high speed. Pour over ice 
and serve. 
  
At just twelve calories, this recipe has twenty-five times fewer calories and at 
least eight times more phytonutrients than typical cranberry juice drinks.80 
For an extra boost, blend in some fresh mint leaves. You’ll get a weird-looking 
green foam on top, but not only will it taste good, you’ll be happy to know that you’re 
chugging down berries and dark, leafy greens, two of the healthiest foods on the 
planet. Bottoms up! 
Coffee 
Back in 1986, a group of Norwegian researchers came across an unexpected finding: 
Alcohol consumption was associated with liver inflammation (no surprise there), but 
coffee consumption was associated with less liver inflammation.81 These results 
were replicated in subsequent studies performed around the world. In the United 
States, a study was done with people at high risk for liver disease—for example, 
those who were overweight or drank too much alcohol. Subjects who drank more 
than two cups of coffee a day appeared to have less than half the risk of developing 
chronic liver problems as those who drank less than one cup.82 
What about liver cancer, one of the most feared complications of chronic liver 
inflammation? It is now the third-leading cause of cancer-related death, an upsurge 
driven largely by increases in hepatitis C infections and nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease.83 
The news is good. A 2013 review of the best studies to date found that people 
who drank the most coffee had half the risk of liver cancer compared to those who 
drank the least.84 A subsequent study found the consumption of four or more cups of 
coffee a day was associated with 92 percent lower risk among smokers dying from 
chronic liver disease.85 Of course, quitting smoking would have helped as well; 
smoking may multiply by as much as tenfold the odds of those with hepatitis C dying 
from liver cancer.86 Similarly, heavy alcohol drinkers who consume more than four 
cups of coffee per day appear to reduce their risk of liver inflammation—but not by 
nearly as much as people who cut down on alcohol.87 
Liver cancers are among the most avoidable cancers, through hepatitis B 
vaccination, control of hepatitis C transmission, and reduction of alcohol 
consumption. These three measures could, in principle, wipe out 90 percent of liver 
cancers worldwide. It remains unclear whether coffee drinking has an additional role 
to play, but such a role would be limited compared with preventing liver damage in 
the first place.88 
But what if you’re already infected with hepatitis C or are among the nearly one in 
three American adults89 with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? Until relatively 
recently, no clinical trials had put coffee to the test. But in 2013, researchers 
published a study in which forty patients with chronic hepatitis C were placed into 
two groups: The first group consumed four cups of coffee daily for a month, while the 
second group drank no coffee at all. After thirty days, the groups switched. Of course, 
two months is not long enough to detect changes in cancer outcomes, but during that 
time, the researchers were able to demonstrate that coffee consumption may reduce 
DNA damage, increase the clearance of virus-infected cells, and slow the scarring 
process.90 These results help explain the role coffee appears to play in reducing the 
risk of liver disease progression. 
A commentary in the journal Gastroenterology entitled “Is It Time to Write a 
Prescription for Coffee?” explored the pros and cons.91 Some insist that we must first 
identify the active ingredient in coffee beans that’s protective. After all, more than 
one thousand different compounds have already been found in coffee.92 More studies 
are needed, but meanwhile, moderate daily ingestion of unsweetened coffee should 
be considered a reasonable adjunct to medical therapy for people at high risk for 
liver damage, such as those with fatty liver disease.93 Keep in mind that daily 
consumption of caffeinated beverages can lead to physical dependence, and caffeine 
withdrawal symptoms can include days of headache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, 
and mood disturbances.94 Ironically, coffee’s tendency to be habit forming could turn 
out to be a good thing. If the liver health benefits are confirmed, then daily 
consumption may ultimately prove to be an advantage.95 
*   *   * 
With liver disease, as always, prevention is the key. All the most serious liver 
conditions—liver cancer, liver failure, and cirrhosis—can start with an inflamed 
liver. That inflammation can be caused by an infection or the buildup of fatty 
deposits. Liver viruses can be prevented by common-sense measures. Don’t inject 
drugs, do get vaccinated, and do practice safe sex. Liver fat can also be prevented by 
common sense measures: Avoid excess consumption of alcohol, calories, 
cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar. 
 CHAPTER 9 
How Not to Die from Blood Cancers 
Eleven-year-old Missy had leukemia. It was in remission, thanks in part to the yellow 
bags of chemo that hung from the IV pole she rolled down the hospital halls. Missy 
was one of my first patients in my pediatrics rotation during medical school at the 
Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor—home to Stephen King, moose-crossing 
signs, and billboards advertising lobster ice cream. 
During this time, I was in full Patch Adams regalia, from the fuzzy pink rabbit ears 
on my head down to the plastic rainbow Slinkys trailing at my feet. On every button 
of my white doctor’s coat hung a Beanie Baby, in every buttonhole was crammed a 
stuffed animal’s foot. Missy drew a smiley face on my beanie hippo and named the 
rooster attached to my stethoscope “Elvis.” 
She loved to paint pictures for me and signed each one of them, in all caps: FROM 
MISSY. In these pictures, she still had her curly brown locks. In reality, though, her 
head was completely bald. She refused to wear a wig, which only made her smile 
seem brighter. 
I painted her nails a pale pink, and she painted mine a lovely purplish brown. 
I remember the morning after she gave me the manicure. My senior resident took 
me aside after rounds. “Your fingernails are getting in people’s way,” he said. 
“Huh?” I asked. 
“The attending physicians are complaining,” he replied. “This is a conservative 
profession.” 
I tried to explain that I didn’t paint them myself, upset that I even felt the need to 
explain at all. The senior resident knew that Missy had done it, but he didn’t seem to 
care. “Medicine,” he said, “is also an anti-emotion profession.” 
Later, the chair of the department had a talk with me. A number of the attending 
physicians were concerned I was “too enthusiastic,” “too dramatic,” and “too 
sensitive.” 
My wife remarked they probably just had Slinky envy. 
The next day, head down, I walked into Missy’s room. 
“I’m sorry,” I told her. “The doctors made me take off the nail polish.” 
I held up my hands to show her. She inspected them and said, with great 
indignation, “If you can’t wear it, then I’m not going to, either!” So I helped her take 
off her polish, bemused and empowered by such solidarity from an eleven-year-old. 
(I let her paint my toenails instead.) 
I remember the last note I wrote in Missy’s medical chart. Hospital progress notes 
are written in SOAP format, a mnemonic for Subjective findings, Objective findings, 
Assessment, and Plan. I wrote: “Assessment: 11yo girl finishing last round of 
maintenance chemotherapy. Plan: Disney World.” 
*   *   * 
Childhood leukemia is one of the few success stories in our war on cancer, with ten- 
year survival rates as high as 90 percent.1 Yet it still affects more children than any 
other cancer and is ten times more likely to be diagnosed in adults, among whom 
current treatments are much less effective.2 
What can we do to help prevent blood cancers in the first place? 
Blood cancers are sometimes referred to as liquid tumors, since the cancer cells 
often circulate throughout the body rather than get concentrated in a solid mass. These 
cancers typically begin undetected in the bone marrow, that spongy tissue in the 
interior of our bones where red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are 
born. When healthy, your red blood cells deliver oxygen throughout your body, your 
white blood cells fight off infections, and your platelets help your blood to clot. Most 
blood cancers involve mutations of the white cells. 
Blood cancers can be categorized into three types: leukemia, lymphoma, and 
myeloma. Leukemia (from the Greek roots leukos, or “white,” and haima, or 
“blood”) is a disease in which the bone marrow feverishly produces abnormal white 
blood cells. Unlike normal ones, these imposters aren’t able to fight infection. They 
also impair the ability of your bone marrow to produce normal red and white cells by 
crowding out healthy ones, creating a diminished healthy blood cell count that can 
lead to anemia, infection, and, eventually, death. According to the American Cancer 
Society, fifty-two thousand Americans are diagnosed with leukemia, and twenty-four 
thousand die from it every year.3 
Lymphoma is a blood cancer of lymphocytes, which are specialized types of 
white blood cells. Lymphoma cells multiply quickly and can collect in your lymph 
nodes, small immune organs that are spread throughout the body, including the 
armpits, neck, and groin. Lymph nodes help to filter your blood. Like leukemia, 
lymphoma can crowd out healthy cells and impair your ability to fight infections. You 
may have heard of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Hodgkin’s lymphoma can strike young 
adults, but it’s a rare and usually treatable form of lymphoma. As its name suggests, 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) includes all the other dozens of types of lymphoma. 
They’re more common and can be harder to treat, and their risk increases with age. 
The American Cancer Society estimates that there are seventy thousand new cases of 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma each year and about nineteen thousand deaths.4 
Finally, myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which are white blood cells that 
produce antibodies, the proteins that stick to invaders and infected cells to neutralize 
or tag them for destruction. Cancerous plasma cells can displace healthy cells from 
your bone marrow and make abnormal antibodies that can clog the kidneys. About 90 
percent of myeloma sufferers are discovered with masses of cancer cells growing in 
multiple bones of their bodies, hence the common term for this condition, multiple 
myeloma. Each year, twenty-four thousand people are diagnosed with multiple 
myeloma, and eleven thousand die.5 
Most people with multiple myeloma live for only a few years after diagnosis. 
Though treatable, multiple myeloma is considered incurable. That’s why prevention 
is key. Fortunately, dietary changes may reduce our risk of all these blood cancers. 
FOODS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RISK OF BLOOD 
CANCERS 
After following more than sixty thousand people for more than a dozen years, 
University of Oxford researchers found that those who consume a plant-based diet 
are less likely to develop all forms of cancer combined. The greatest protection 
appeared to be against blood cancers. The incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, and 
multiple myeloma among those eating vegetarian diets is nearly half that of those 
eating meat.6 Why is this greatly reduced risk of blood cancers associated with a 
more plant-based diet? The British Journal of Cancer concluded, “More research is 
needed to understand the mechanisms behind this.”7 While they are figuring out the 
reasons, why not get a head start and try adding more healthy plant foods to your 
plates today? 
Greens and Cancer 
The key to cancer prevention and treatment is to keep tumor cells from multiplying 
out of control while allowing healthy cells to grow normally. Chemotherapy and 
radiation can do a great job of wiping out cancer cells, but healthy cells can get 
caught in the crossfire. Some compounds in plants, though, may be more 
discriminating. 
For instance, sulforaphane, considered one of the more active components in 
cruciferous vegetables, kills human leukemia cells in a petri dish while having little 
impact on the growth of normal cells.8 As we’ve discussed, cruciferous vegetables 
include broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, but there are many others in this family, such 
as collard greens, watercress, bok choy, kohlrabi, rutabaga, turnips, arugula, radishes 
(including horseradish), wasabi, and all types of cabbage. 
It’s intriguing that dripping cabbage compounds on cancer cells affects them in a 
laboratory, but what really matters is whether people with blood cancers who eat 
lots of vegetables actually live longer than those who don’t. For about eight years, 
Yale University researchers followed more than five hundred women with non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Those who started out eating three or more servings of 
vegetables daily had a 42 percent improved survival rate over those who ate less. 
Green, leafy vegetables, including salad and cooked greens, and citrus fruits 
appeared most protective.9 It’s not clear, though, whether the survival benefit arose 
from helping to keep the cancer at bay or from improving patients’ tolerance to the 
chemotherapy and radiation treatments they were receiving. The accompanying 
editorial in the journal Leukemia & Lymphoma suggested that a “lymphoma 
diagnosis may be an important ‘teachable’ moment to improve diet.…”10 I would 
suggest you not wait until a cancer diagnosis to clean up your diet. 
The Iowa Women’s Health Study, which has followed more than thirty-five 
thousand women for decades, found that higher broccoli and other cruciferous 
vegetable intake was associated with lower risk of getting non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
in the first place.11 Likewise, a study at the Mayo Clinic found that those who ate 
about five or more servings of green, leafy vegetables a week had roughly half the 
odds of getting lymphoma compared with those who ate less than one serving a 
week.12 
Some of the plant-based protection might have been due to the antioxidant 
properties of fruits and vegetables. Higher dietary intake of antioxidants is associated 
with significantly lower lymphoma risk. Note I said dietary intake, not 
supplementary intake. Antioxidant supplements don’t appear to work.13 For example, 
getting lots of vitamin C in your diet is associated with lower lymphoma risk, but 
taking in even more vitamin C in pill form did not seem to help. The same was found 
for carotenoid antioxidants like beta-carotene.14 Apparently, pills do not have the 
same cancer-fighting effects as produce. 
When it comes to certain other cancers, like those of the digestive tract, 
antioxidant supplements may even make things worse. Combinations of antioxidants 
like vitamin A, vitamin E, and beta-carotene in pill form were associated with 
increased risk of death in those who took them.15 Supplements contain only a select 
few antioxidants, whereas your body relies on hundreds of them, all working 
synergistically to create a network to help the body dispose of free radicals. High 
doses of a single antioxidant may upset this delicate balance and may actually 
diminish your body’s ability to fight cancer.16 
When you buy antioxidant supplements, you may be doling out money to live a 
shorter life. Save your cash and your health by eating the real thing: food. 
Açai Berries and Leukemia 
Açai berries gained celebrity status in 2008 when television personality Dr. Mehmet 
Oz talked about them on The Oprah Winfrey Show.  This spawned a frenzy of 
knockoff supplements, powders, shakes, and other dubious products bearing the açai 
berry label but not necessarily containing any of the actual berry.17 Even major 
corporations have jumped on the açai bandwagon, including Anheuser-Busch with its 
180 Blue “with Açai Energy” drink and Coca-Cola with its Bossa Nova beverage. 
This is an all-too-common practice in the “superfruit” supplement and beverage 
market, where less than a quarter of products sold may even contain the ingredients 
their labels claim.18,19 The benefits of these products are suspect at best, but there is 
some preliminary research on real açai berries, which can be purchased as 
unsweetened frozen pulp. 
The first study published in the medical literature on the effects of açai on human 
tissue was performed on leukemia cells. Researchers dripped an açai berry extract 
on leukemia cells taken from a thirty-six-year-old woman. It appeared to trigger self- 
destruct reactions in up to 86 percent of the cells.20 Also, sprinkling some freeze- 
dried açai berries on immune cells called macrophages (from the Greek words 
makros and phagein, meaning “big eater”) in a petri dish appeared to enable the 
cells to engulf and devour up to 40 percent more microbes than usual.21 
Though the leukemia study was done using açai extract at the concentration one 
might expect to find in the bloodstream after eating the berries, no studies have yet 
been performed on cancer patients themselves (just cancer cells in a test tube), so 
more testing is needed. Indeed, the only clinical studies on açai berries published so 
far were two small industry-funded trials that showed modest benefit for 
osteoarthritis sufferers22 and some metabolic parameters of overweight subjects.23 
In terms of antioxidant bang for your buck, açai berries get honorable mention, 
beating out other superstars, such as walnuts, apples, and cranberries. The bronze for 
best bargain, though, goes to cloves, the silver to cinnamon, and the gold for most 
antioxidants per dollar—according to a USDA database of common foods—goes to 
purple cabbage.24 Açai berries, however, would probably make a tastier smoothie. 
Curcumin and Multiple Myeloma 
As noted, multiple myeloma is one of the most dreaded cancers. It is practically 
incurable even with aggressive medical treatment. As myeloma cells take over the 
bone marrow, healthy white blood cells continue to decline in number, which 
increases your susceptibility to infection. Reduced levels of red blood cells can lead 
to anemia, and reduced platelet counts can lead to serious bleeding. Once diagnosed, 
most people survive fewer than five years.25 
Multiple myeloma does not occur out of the blue. It appears to be nearly always 
preceded by a precancerous condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of 
undetermined significance, or MGUS.26 When scientists first discovered MGUS, it 
was aptly named because, at that time, the significance of finding elevated levels of 
abnormal antibodies in someone’s body was unclear. We now know it’s a precursor 
to multiple myeloma, and about 3 percent of Caucasians over age fifty have it,27 
while the rate among African Americans may be double.28 
MGUS causes no symptoms. You won’t even know you have it unless your doctor 
finds it incidentally during routine blood work. The chance of MGUS progressing 
into myeloma is about 1 percent per year, which means many MGUS-stricken people 
may die of other causes before they develop myeloma.29 However, since multiple 
myeloma is basically a death sentence, scientists have been desperate to find ways to 
stop MGUS in its tracks. 
Given the safety and efficacy of the turmeric spice component curcumin against 
other types of cancer cells, researchers from the University of Texas collected 
multiple myeloma cells and put them in a petri dish. Without any intervention, the 
cancer cells quadrupled within a few days—that’s how fast this cancer can grow. But 
when a little curcumin was added to the broth they were bathing in, the myeloma 
cells’ growth was either stunted or stopped altogether.30 
As we’ve discovered, stopping cancer in a laboratory is one thing. What about in 
people? In 2009, a pilot study found that half (five out of ten) of the subjects with 
MGUS who had particularly high abnormal antibody levels responded positively to 
curcumin supplements. None (zero out of nine) of those given a placebo experienced 
a similar drop in antibody levels.31 Buoyed by this success, scientists conducted a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and achieved similarly 
encouraging results in both patients with MGUS and those with “smoldering” 
multiple myeloma, an early stage of the disease.32 This result suggests that a simple 
spice found in the grocery store might have the ability to slow or stop this horrific 
cancer in a certain percentage of patients, though we won’t know more until longer 
studies are performed to see if these hopeful changes in blood-work biomarkers 
translate into changes in actual patient outcomes. In the meantime, it couldn’t hurt to 
spice up your diet. 
ARE ANIMAL VIRUSES INVOLVED IN HUMAN BLOOD 
CANCERS? 
The reason people eating plant-based diets appear to have much lower rates of blood 
cancers33 may be due to the foods they’re choosing to eat and/or choosing to avoid. 
To tease out the role different animal products might play in the myriad blood 
cancers, we would need to conduct a very large study. Enter the aptly named EPIC 
study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which did 
just that. As we saw in chapter 4, researchers recruited more than four hundred 
thousand men and women across ten countries and followed them for about nine 
years. If you recall, regular chicken consumption was associated with an increased 
risk for pancreatic cancer. Similar findings were found for blood cancers. Of all the 
animal products studied (including unusual categories, such as offal, or entrails and 
organs), poultry tended to be associated with the greatest increased risk of non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, all grades of follicular lymphoma, and B-cell lymphomas, such 
as B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (including small lymphocytic leukemia and 
prolymphocytic lymphocytic leukemia).34 The EPIC study found that risk increased 
between 56 percent and 280 percent for every 50 grams of poultry consumed daily. 
For comparison, a cooked, boneless chicken breast may weigh as much as 384 
grams.35 
Why is there so much lymphoma and leukemia risk associated with eating such 
relatively small amounts of poultry? The researchers suggested this result could be a 
fluke, or it could be due to the drugs, such as antibiotics, that are often fed to chickens 
and turkeys to promote their growth. Or it might be the dioxins found in some poultry 
meat, which have been linked to lymphoma.36 But dairy can also contain dioxins, and 
milk consumption was not linked to NHL. The researchers surmised it may be the 
cancer-causing viruses in poultry, given that lower risk of NHL has been associated 
with eating meat cooked well done instead of rare (thereby inactivating any 
viruses).37 This suggestion is consistent with the results of the NIH-AARP study (see 
here), which found an association between eating just-done chicken and one type of 
lymphoma and lower risk of another blood cancer tied to greater exposure to the 
cooked meat carcinogen MeIQx.38 
How could less cancer be linked to more carcinogen exposure? MeIQx is one of 
the heterocyclic amines created by cooking meat at high temperatures, such as baking, 
broiling, and frying.39 If, in the case of blood cancers, one cause is a poultry virus, 
then the more the meat was cooked, the more likely it is that the virus was destroyed. 
Cancer-causing poultry viruses—including the avian herpesvirus that causes Marek’s 
disease, several retroviruses like reticuloendotheliosis virus, the avian leukosis virus 
found in chickens, and the lymphoproliferative disease virus found in turkeys—may 
explain the higher rates of blood cancers among farmers,40 slaughterhouse workers,41 
and butchers.42 Viruses can cause cancer by directly inserting a cancer-causing gene 
into a host’s DNA.43 
Animal viruses can infect people who prepare meat with unpleasant skin 
diseases, such as contagious pustular dermatitis.44 There’s even a well-defined 
medical condition commonly known as “butchers’ warts” that affects the hands of 
those who handle fresh meat, including poultry and fish.45 Even the wives of butchers 
appear to be at higher risk for cervical cancer, a cancer definitively associated with 
wart-virus exposure.46 
Workers in poultry slaughterhouses have been found to have higher rates of 
cancers of the mouth, nasal cavities, throat, esophagus, rectum, liver, and blood. On a 
public health level, the concern here is that the cancer-causing viruses present in 
poultry and poultry products may then be transmitted to those in the general 
population who handle or eat inadequately cooked chicken.47 These results were 
replicated recently in the largest such investigation to date, studying more than twenty 
thousand workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants. They confirmed the 
findings of three other studies to date: Workers in these facilities do have increased 
risk of dying from certain cancers, including cancers of the blood.48 
Researchers are finally starting to connect the dots. The high levels of antibodies 
to avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses49 and to reticuloendotheliosis viruses50 recently 
found in poultry workers provide evidence of human exposure to these cancer- 
causing poultry viruses. Even line workers who simply cut up the finished product 
and weren’t ever exposed to live birds had elevated levels of antibodies in their 
blood.51 Beyond just occupational safety, the potential threat to the public, the 
researchers concluded, “is not trivial.”52 
Elevated blood cancer rates can even be traced back to the farm. An analysis of 
more than one hundred thousand death certificates found that those who grew up on a 
farm raising animals appeared significantly more likely to develop a blood cancer 
later in life, whereas growing up on a farm growing only crops was not. Worst was 
growing up on a poultry farm, which was associated with nearly three times the odds 
of developing blood cancer.53 
Exposure to cattle and pigs has also been associated with non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma.54 A 2003 study by University of California researchers revealed that 
nearly three-quarters of human subjects tested positive for exposure to the bovine 
leukemia virus, likely through the consumption of meat and dairy products.55 
Approximately 85 percent of U.S. dairy herds have tested positive for the virus (and 
100 percent on industrial-scale operations).56 
However, just because people are exposed to a virus that causes cancer in cows 
does not mean that humans themselves can become actively infected with it. In 2014, 
researchers supported in part by the U.S. Army Breast Cancer Research Program 
published a remarkable report in a journal of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. They reported that the bovine leukemia virus DNA was found to be 
incorporated into normal and cancerous human breast tissue, effectively proving that 
people can also become infected with this cancer-causing animal virus.57 To date, 
however, the role poultry and other farm animal viruses play in the development of 
human cancers remains unknown. 
What about the feline leukemia virus? Thankfully, pet companionship is 
associated with lower rates of lymphoma, which is a personal relief given how many 
animals I’ve shared my life with. And the longer people have had cats or dogs in 
their lives, the lower their risk. In one study, the lowest risk of lymphoma was found 
in people who had had pets for twenty years or longer. The researchers suspect the 
reason is connected to the fact that having pets may have beneficial effects on the 
immune system.58 
*   *   * 
A pair of Harvard University studies suggested that diet soda consumption may 
increase the risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma,59 but this 
association was only seen among men and was not confirmed in two other large 
studies on aspartame-sweetened soda.60,61 Eliminating soda can’t hurt, though, in 
addition to making the dietary changes outlined above. 
Plant-based diets are associated with nearly half the risk of blood cancers, 
protection likely to derive both from the avoidance of foods tied to liquid tumors, 
such as poultry, as well as the additional consumption of fruits and vegetables. 
Greens may be particularly useful for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and turmeric for 
multiple myeloma. The role tumor-promoting farm animal viruses play in human 
cancers is not known, but this should be a research priority given the potential extent 
of public exposure. 
 CHAPTER 10 
How Not to Die from Kidney Disease 
Letters and e-mails from patients never fail to inspire me. One note that came to mind 
as I was writing this chapter was from Dan, a retired NFL player. I first met him 
when he was forty-two. Even at that relatively young age, the former professional 
athlete was already taking three separate blood pressure medications. Still, his blood 
pressure was elevated. He was a little overweight, maybe by twenty-five pounds. He 
and his significant other waited around after one of my talks to see me. 
Dan’s physician had just told him that his kidneys were starting to show signs of 
damage due to his blood pressure. The first thing I asked was if he was taking his 
meds as prescribed, since many people skip their blood pressure medications 
because of their unpleasant side effects. Yes, he assured me, he was. He showed me 
a checklist he carried around to keep track of his meds. He asked me what 
supplements he could add to the list to help his kidneys. 
I told him that no matter what he might have seen on the Internet, there’s no such 
magic pill, but if he filled up his plate with lots of whole, healthy foods each day, the 
damage might be stopped or even reversed. Well, Dan took this advice to heart (and 
to kidney!), and he allowed me to share his e-mail: 
Well, I went home that night and we cleaned house. Got rid of everything that didn’t grow out of the ground, 
everything processed. And guess what, over the next year, I lost my beer belly and the high blood pressure. 
Life is so much better without those medications—they made me feel so tired all the time. And my kidney 
function is back to normal. It makes me mad that no one told me this sooner and that I had to feel so bad 
before I felt better. 
It’s easy to take your kidneys for granted, but they work around the clock, like a 
high-tech, nonstop water filter for your blood. They process up to 150 quarts of 
blood every twenty-four hours just to make the 1–2 quarts of urine you pee out each 
day. 
If your kidneys do not function properly, metabolic waste products can 
accumulate in the blood and eventually lead to such symptoms as weakness, shortness 
of breath, confusion, and abnormal heart rhythms. Most people with deteriorating 
kidney function, however, don’t experience any symptoms at all. If your kidneys fail 
completely, you will either need a new one (i.e., need a kidney transplant) or have to 
go on dialysis, a process by which a machine artificially filters the blood. But kidney 
donors are in short supply, and the average life expectancy of a person on dialysis is 
less than three years.1 It’s better to keep your kidneys healthy in the first place. 
Although your kidneys can fail suddenly in response to certain toxins, infections, 
or urinary blockage, most kidney disease is characterized by a gradual loss of 
function over time. A national survey found that only 41 percent of Americans tested 
had normal kidney function, a drop from 52 percent about a decade earlier.2 
Approximately one in three Americans over the age of sixty-four may suffer from 
chronic kidney disease (CKD),3 though three-quarters of the millions affected may 
not even know they have it.4 More than half of American adults currently aged thirty 
to sixty-four are expected to develop chronic kidney disease during their lifetimes.5 
Why, then, aren’t millions of people on dialysis? Because kidney malfunction can 
be so damaging to the rest of the body that most people don’t live long enough to 
reach that stage. In a study in which more than a thousand Americans over age sixty- 
four with CKD were followed for a decade, only one in twenty developed end-stage 
kidney failure. Most of the others had already died, with cardiovascular disease 
killing more than all other causes combined.6 That’s because our kidneys are so 
critical to proper heart function that patients under age forty-five with kidney failure 
can be a hundred times more likely to die of heart disease than those with working 
kidneys.7 
The good news? The diets that are healthiest for our hearts—those centered 
around unprocessed plant foods—may be the best way to prevent and treat kidney 
disease as well. 
Damaging Your Kidneys with Diet 
Kidneys are highly vascular organs, meaning they’re packed with blood vessels, 
which is why they look so red. We’ve already seen that the standard American diet 
can be toxic to blood vessels in the heart and the brain—so what might it be doing to 
the kidneys? 
Putting that question to the test, researchers at Harvard University followed 
thousands of healthy women, their diets, and their kidney function for more than a 
decade8 to look for the presence of protein in the women’s urine. Healthy kidneys 
work hard to retain protein and other vital nutrients, preferably filtering toxic or 
useless wastes out of the bloodstream via our urine. If the kidneys are leaking protein 
into urine, it’s a sign that they may be starting to fail. 
The researchers found three specific dietary components associated with this sign 
of declining kidney function: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. Each of 
these is found in only one place: animal products. The researchers found no 
association between kidney function decline and the intake of protein or fat from 
plant sources.9 
One hundred and fifty years ago, Rudolf Virchow, the father of modern pathology, 
first described fatty degeneration of the kidney.10 This concept of lipid 
nephrotoxicity, or the idea that fat and cholesterol in the bloodstream could be toxic 
to the kidneys, has since been formalized,11 based in part on studies that found plugs 
of fat clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys.12 
The link between cholesterol and kidney disease has gained such momentum in the 
medical community that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs have been recommended to 
slow its progression.13 But wouldn’t it be better (not to mention safer and cheaper) to 
treat the underlying cause of the disease by eating healthier? 
Which Type of Protein Is Better for Our Kidneys? 
In the two decades between 1990 and 2010, the leading causes of death and 
disability remained relatively constant. As noted in chapter 1, heart disease is still 
the leading cause of loss of health and life. Some diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, have 
slid down the list, but among the diseases whose incidence has increased the most 
over the past generation is chronic kidney disease. The number of deaths has 
doubled.14 
This has been blamed on our “meat-sweet” diet.15 Excess table sugar and high- 
fructose corn syrup consumption is associated with increased blood pressure and 
uric acid levels, both of which can damage the kidney. The saturated fat, trans fat, 
and cholesterol found in animal products and junk food are also associated with 
impaired kidney function, and meat protein increases the acid load to the kidneys, 
boosting ammonia production and potentially damaging our sensitive kidney cells.16 
This is why a restriction of protein intake is often recommended to chronic kidney 
disease patients to help prevent further functional decline.17 
But all protein isn’t created equal. It’s important to understand that not all protein 
has the same effect on your kidneys. 
High animal protein intake can have a profound influence on normal human kidney 
function by inducing a state called hyperfiltration, a dramatic increase in the 
workload of the kidney. Hyperfiltration isn’t harmful if it occurs only occasionally. 
We all have built-in reserve kidney function—so much so that people can live with 
only one kidney. The human body is thought to have evolved the capacity to handle 
intermittent large doses of protein from our remote hunting and scavenging days. But 
now many of us are ingesting large doses of animal protein day after day, forcing our 
kidneys to call on their reserves continuously. Over time, this unrelenting stress may 
explain why kidney function tends to decline as people age, predisposing even 
otherwise healthy people to progressive deterioration of kidney function.18 
The reason those who eat a plant-based diet appear to have better kidney function 
was originally thought to be due to their lower overall protein intake.19 However, we 
now know that it’s more likely due to the fact that the kidneys appear to handle plant 
protein very differently from animal protein.20 
Within hours of consuming meat, your kidneys rev up into hyperfiltration mode. 
This is true of a variety of animal proteins—beef, chicken, and fish appear to have 
similar effects.21 But an equivalent amount of plant protein causes virtually no 
noticeable stress on the kidneys.22 Eat some tuna, and within three hours, your kidney 
filtration rate can shoot up 36 percent. But eating the same amount of protein in the 
form of tofu doesn’t appear to place any additional strain on the kidneys.23 
Could substituting plant protein for animal protein help slow the deterioration of 
kidney function? Yes, half a dozen clinical trials have shown that plant protein 
replacement can reduce hyperfiltration and/or protein leakage,24,25,26,27,28,29 but all 
these studies were short term, lasting fewer than eight weeks. It wasn’t until 2014 that 
a six-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was 
performed examining how the kidneys process soy protein versus dairy protein. 
Consistent with the other studies, plant protein was found to help preserve function in 
ailing kidneys.30 
Why does animal protein cause the overload reaction while plant protein doesn’t? 
Because of the inflammation animal products can cause. Researchers discovered that 
after giving study subjects a powerful anti-inflammatory drug along with animal 
protein, the hyperfiltration response and protein spillage disappeared.31 
Reducing Dietary Acid Load 
Another reason animal protein may be so detrimental to kidney function is that it is 
generally more acid forming. This is because animal protein tends to have higher 
levels of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine, which produce sulfuric 
acid when metabolized in the body. Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, are 
generally base forming, which helps neutralize acids in our kidneys.32 
Dietary acid load is determined by the balance of acid-inducing foods (such as 
meats, eggs, and cheese) and base-inducing foods (such as fruits and vegetables). A 
2014 analysis of the diets and kidney function of more than twelve thousand 
Americans across the country found that a higher dietary acid load was associated 
with significantly higher risk of protein leakage into the urine, an indicator of kidney 
damage.33 
Ancient human diets largely consisted of plants, so they likely produced more 
base than acid in the kidneys of our ancestors. Humans evolved eating these alkaline 
(base-forming) diets over millions of years. Most contemporary diets, on the other 
hand, produce acid in excess. This switch from base- to acid-forming diets may help 
explain our modern epidemic of kidney disease.34 Acid-inducing diets are believed 
to impact the kidney through “tubular toxicity,” damage to the tiny, delicate, urine- 
making tubes in the kidneys. To buffer the excess acid formed by your diet, kidneys 
produce ammonia, which is a base and can neutralize some of that acid. 
Counteracting the acid is beneficial in the short term, but over the long run, all the 
extra ammonia in the kidneys may have a toxic effect.35 The decline in kidney 
function over time may be a consequence of a lifetime of ammonia overproduction.36 
Kidneys may start to deteriorate in your twenties,37 and by the time you reach your 
eighties, you may be down to half capacity.38 
The chronic, low-grade, metabolic acidosis attributed to a meat-rich diet39 helps 
explain why people eating plant-based diets appear to have superior kidney 
function40 and why various plant-based diets have been so successful in treating 
chronic kidney failure.41,42 Under normal circumstances, a vegetarian diet alkalinizes 
the kidneys, whereas a nonvegetarian diet carries an acid load. This proved to be 
true even among vegetarians who consumed processed meat substitutes, such as 
veggie burgers.43 
If people are unwilling to reduce their meat consumption, they should be 
encouraged to eat more fruits and vegetables to balance out that acid load.44 
“However,” one kidney doctor editorialized, “many patients find it difficult to follow 
a diet high in fruits and vegetables and might therefore be more adherent to a 
supplement.”45 
So what did researchers try? Giving people baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) 
pills. Instead of treating the primary cause of the excess acid formation (too many 
animal products and too few fruits and vegetables), they preferred to treat the 
consequences. Too much acid? Here’s some base to neutralize it. Sodium 
bicarbonate can effectively buffer the acid load,46 but, rather obviously, sodium 
bicarbonate contains sodium, which over the long term may itself contribute to kidney 
damage.47 
Unfortunately, this type of Band-Aid approach is all too typical of today’s 
medical model. Cholesterol too high from eating a diet unnaturally high in saturated 
fat and cholesterol? Take a statin drug to cripple your cholesterol-making enzyme. 
Diet unnaturally high in acid-forming foods? Swallow some baking soda pills to 
balance that right out. 
These same researchers also tried giving people fruits and vegetables instead of 
baking soda and found that they offered similar protections, with the additional 
advantage of lowering the subjects’ blood pressure. The title of the accompanying 
commentary in the medical journal was telling: “The Key to Halting Progression of 
CKD Might Be in the Produce Market, Not in the Pharmacy.”48 
Kidney Stones 
Eating a plant-based diet to alkalinize your urine may also help prevent and treat 
kidney stones—those hard mineral deposits that can form in your kidneys when the 
concentration of certain stone-forming substances in your urine becomes so high they 
start to crystallize. Eventually, these crystals can grow into pebble-sized rocks that 
block the flow of urine, causing severe pain that tends to radiate from one side of the 
lower back toward the groin. Kidney stones can pass naturally (and often painfully), 
but some become so large that they have to be removed surgically. 
The incidence of kidney stones has increased dramatically since World War II 49 
and even just in the last fifteen years. Approximately one in eleven Americans are 
affected today, compared with one in twenty less than two decades ago.50 What 
accounts for this rising incidence? The first clue to an answer came in 1979 when 
scientists reported a striking relationship between the prevalence of kidney stones 
since the 1950s and increasing consumption of animal protein.51 As in all 
observational studies, though, the researchers couldn’t prove cause and effect, so 
they decided to perform an interventional trial: They asked the subjects to add extra 
animal protein to their daily diets, the equivalent of about an extra can’s worth of 
tuna fish. Within two days of eating the extra tuna, the levels of stone-forming 
compounds—calcium, oxalate, and uric acid—shot up such that the subjects’ kidney- 
stone risk increased 250 percent.52 
Note the experimental “high” animal protein diet was designed to re-create the 
animal protein intake of the average American,53 suggesting that Americans could 
considerably lower their risk of kidney stones by lowering their meat intake. 
By the 1970s, enough evidence had accumulated that researchers began to ask 
whether people suffering from recurrent kidney stones should stop eating meat 
altogether.54 A study on the kidney stone risk of vegetarians wasn’t published until 
2014, though. Oxford University researchers found that subjects who didn’t eat meat 
at all had a significantly lower risk of being hospitalized for kidney stones, and for 
those who did eat meat, the more they ate, the higher their associated risk.55 
Is some meat worse than others? People who form kidney stones are commonly 
advised to restrict their intake of red meat, but what about chicken or fish? We didn’t 
know until another 2014 study compared salmon and cod to chicken breasts and 
burgers. It found that gram for gram, fish might be slightly worse than other meat in 
terms of the risk of certain kidney stones, but they concluded that overall, “[s]tone 
formers should be counseled to limit the intake of all animal proteins.”56 
Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate, which forms like rock 
candy when urine becomes supersaturated with calcium and oxalates. For many 
years, doctors assumed that because the stones are made of calcium, they should 
counsel their patients to simply reduce their calcium intake.57 As with so much in 
medicine, clinical practice often flies blind without solid experimental support. This 
changed with a landmark study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 
which pitted the traditional, low-calcium diet against a diet low in animal protein 
and sodium. After five years, the study found that eating less meat and salt was about 
twice as effective as the conventionally prescribed low-calcium diet, cutting kidney- 
stone risk by half.58 
What about cutting down on oxalates, which are concentrated in certain 
vegetables? Reassuringly, a recent study found there was no increased risk of stone 
formation with higher vegetable intake. In fact, greater intake of fruits and vegetables 
was associated with a reduced risk independent of other known risk factors, meaning 
there may be additional benefits to bulking up on plant foods above and beyond 
restricting animal foods.59 
Another reason a reduction in animal protein is helpful is that it lowers uric acid 
buildup, which can form crystals that seed calcium stones or form stones all by itself. 
Indeed, uric acid stones are the second most common type of kidney stones. So it 
makes sense that to reduce your risk, you should try to reduce excess uric acid 
production. This can be accomplished either of two ways: by adding drugs or by 
subtracting meat.60 Uric acid–blocking medications like allopurinol may be effective, 
but they can have serious side effects.61 On the other hand, removing all meat from a 
standard Western diet appears to reduce the risk of uric acid crystallization by more 
than 90 percent within as few as five days.62 
Bottom line: When urine is more alkaline, stones are less likely to form. This 
helps explain why less meat and more fruits and vegetables appear so protective. The 
standard American diet yields acidic urine. When people are placed on a plant-based 
diet, however, their urine can be alkalinized up to a near neutral pH in less than a 
week.63 
Not all plant foods are alkalinizing, though, and not all animal foods are equally 
acidifying. The LAKE (Load of Acid to Kidney Evaluation) score takes into account 
both the acid load of foods and their typical serving sizes in order to help people 
modify their diets for the prevention of kidney stones and other acid-related diseases, 
such as gout. As you can see in figure 4, the single most acid-producing food was 
fish, including tuna, followed by pork, poultry, cheese, and beef. Eggs are actually 
more acid producing than beef, but people tend to eat fewer of them at one sitting. 
Some grains can be a little acid forming, such as bread and rice, but not pasta, 
interestingly. Beans are significantly acid reducing, but not as much as fruits are, 
with vegetables crowned the most alkaline forming of foods.64 
Figure 4 
Dietary changes can be so powerful they can not only help prevent kidney stones 
but also, in some cases, cure them without drugs or surgery. Uric acid stones can 
apparently be dissolved away completely with a combination of eating more fruits 
and vegetables, restricting animal protein and salt intake, and drinking at least ten 
glasses of fluid a day.65 
Testing Your “Pee-H” with Purple Cabbage 
We know that the average Western diet is acid producing, while the average plant- 
based diet is acid reducing.66 Eating an acid-forming diet can not only affect kidney 
stone risk but may also produce the systemic, chronic, low-grade metabolic 
acidosis67—excess acid in the bloodstream—that is thought to contribute to muscle 
breakdown as you age.68 So what’s the best way to determine how acid forming your 
diet really is? Perhaps the easiest (and most boring) method is to order some pH 
paper strips to pee on. Alternatively, why not use what you (should) have right now 
in your refrigerator’s crisper: purple cabbage. Purple, or red, cabbage provides one 
of the single best nutritional bangs for your buck, and you can even use it to perform 
kitchen chemistry experiments, or in this case, bathroom chemistry. 
Boil some purple cabbage until the water turns deep purple, or blend raw 
cabbage with some water and then strain out the solids. Pee into your toilet then take 
your purple-cabbage cocktail and pour it into the toilet bowl. (Low-flow toilets work 
best, because there’s less water in the bowl.) If the liquid in the toilet bowl remains 
purple or, even worse, turns pink, your urine is too acidic. Blue is the target. If your 
pee and cabbage water turns blue, your urine is not acidic but neutral or even basic. 
Preventing Excess Phosphorus Intake 
Having too much phosphorus in the blood may increase the risk of kidney failure, 
heart failure, heart attacks, and premature death. Excess phosphorus also appears to 
damage our blood vessels and accelerate aging and bone loss.69 As such, elevated 
levels appear to be an independent risk factor for early death among the general 
population.70 
Phosphorus is found in a variety of plant and animal foods. Most Americans 
consume about twice as much phosphorus as they need,71 but it’s not just about how 
much you eat but how much you absorb. By switching to a plant-based diet, you can 
achieve a significant drop in your blood phosphorus levels even as your intake levels 
of the mineral remains constant.72 This occurs because the phosphorus in animal 
foods appears in the form of a compound called phosphate, which is absorbed into 
the bloodstream more readily than phytate, the predominant form of phosphorus in 
plant foods.73 As you may remember from chapter 4, this situation is similar to the 
case of iron, another essential mineral of which you can get too much. Your body can 
better protect itself from absorbing too much plant-based iron, but it can’t as 
effectively stop surplus muscle or blood-based (heme) iron from slipping through the 
intestinal wall. 
The worst type of phosphorus, though, is that found in phosphate food additives. 
These phosphorus compounds are added to cola drinks and meat to enhance their 
color.74 (Without added phosphate, Coca-Cola would be pitch black.75) Less than 
half of most plant phosphorus76 and about three-quarters of natural animal product 
phosphorus gets into your bloodstream,77 but added phosphate can be absorbed at a 
rate of nearly 100 percent.78 
Phosphate additives play an especially important role in the meat industry. 
Chicken meat is often injected with phosphates to improve its color, to add water 
weight (and thus to increase profitability since chicken can be sold by the pound), 
and to reduce “purge,” the term used to describe the liquid that seeps from meat as it 
ages.79 The problem with this additive is that it can nearly double the phosphorous 
levels in meat.80 Phosphate additives have been described as “a real and insidious 
danger” for kidney patients, since they have diminished capacity to excrete it,81 but 
given what we now know about excess phosphorus, it’s a concern for us all. 
In the United States, eleven different types of phosphate salts are allowed to be 
injected into raw meat and poultry,82 a practice that’s long been banned in Europe.83 
This is because phosphates found in meat and processed foods are considered 
“vascular toxins,”84 capable of impairing our arterial function within hours of 
consuming a high-phosphate meal.85 In meat, there’s an additional food safety 
concern, as adding phosphate may increase the growth of leading food poisoning 
bacteria Campylobacter in poultry purge up to a millionfold.86 
It’s easy to avoid added phosphorus in processed foods—just don’t buy anything 
containing ingredients with the word “phosphate” in their names, including 
pyrophosphate and sodium triphosphate.87 With meat, it’s more difficult to determine 
the phosphate content, as producers aren’t required to disclose injected additives. 
Added phosphate may be labeled as “flavorings” or “broth” or not labeled at all.88 
Meat already contains highly absorbable phosphates; adding more may just add insult 
to kidney injury. Chicken appears to be the worst offender: A supermarket survey 
found more than 90 percent of chicken products contained phosphate additives.89 
Who Determines Whether Food Additives Are Safe? 
In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finally announced its plans to all but 
eliminate trans fats from processed foods,90 citing a CDC estimate that as many as 
twenty thousand heart attacks each year could be prevented by eliminating partially 
hydrogenated oils.91 Until June 16, 2015, trans fats enjoyed so-called GRAS status: 
“generally recognized as safe.” 
Why were these killer fats deemed safe in the first place? 
Guess who makes the “generally recognized as safe” determination? It’s not the 
government or a scientific body. It’s the manufacturer. You read that right. The food 
maker gets to determine whether or not its own product is safe for the public, a 
process the FDA refers to as “GRAS self-determination.” What’s more, these 
manufacturers can legally add things to our food supply without informing the FDA.92 
An estimated one thousand food-additive safety decisions have never even been 
reported to the FDA or the public.93 
But sometimes food manufacturers do notify the FDA when they introduce a new 
additive. Sounds responsible of them, doesn’t it? Presumably they found some 
independent, third-party panel to evaluate the safety of their product so as to avoid a 
financial conflict of interest, right? 
Well, not exactly. 
Of all the GRAS safety determinations that were voluntarily submitted to the FDA 
between 1997 and 2012, 22.4 percent were made by someone directly employed by 
the manufacturer itself, 13.3 percent were made by someone directly employed by a 
firm handpicked by the manufacturer, and 64.3 percent were made by a panel either 
handpicked by the manufacturer or chosen by a firm hired by the manufacturer.94 Are 
you doing the math? Yes, zero food safety decisions were made independently. 
How could regulators let companies decide for themselves whether the food 
additives they use in their own products are safe? Follow the money. Three of 
Washington’s largest lobbying firms reportedly now work for the food industry.95 For 
example, PepsiCo alone spent more than $9 million in a single year to lobby 
Congress.96 The deeper you dig, the less surprising it is that such food additives as 
trans fats have been allowed to kill thousands year after year. 
But hey, according to the manufacturer, they’re safe … 
Can Diet Protect Against Kidney Cancer? 
Each year, sixty-four thousand Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer, and 
about fourteen thousand die from it.97 Approximately 4 percent of these cases are 
hereditary,98 but what about the other 96 percent? 
Historically, the only accepted risk factor for kidney cancer has been tobacco 
use.99 A class of carcinogens in cigarette smoke called nitrosamines are considered 
to be so harmful that even so-called thirdhand smoke is a concern. The risks of 
tobacco smoke do not end when a cigarette is extinguished, as residual smoke can 
stick to walls and other surfaces.100 Around 80 percent of nitrosamines from cigarette 
smoke can remain in a room, even with normal ventilation,101 so always try to choose 
smoke-free hotel rooms. Nitrosamines are one of the reasons you can’t smoke 
indoors without endangering others, even if you smoke without anyone present. As 
one of the leading scholars in the tobacco control movement recently wrote, 
“Carcinogens of this strength in any other consumer product designed for human 
consumption would be banned immediately.”102 
Except for one: meat. 
Did you know that one hot dog has as many nitrosamines (and nitrosamides, which 
are similar tobacco carcinogens103) as four cigarettes and that these carcinogens are 
also found in fresh meat, including beef, chicken, and pork?104 This may help explain 
the rising rates of kidney cancer over the last few decades despite the falling rates of 
smoking. 
Clearing the Confusion: Nitrates, Nitrites, and 
Nitrosamines 
Although fresh meat also contains nitrosamines, processed or cured meat like deli 
slices may be particularly harmful. In Europe, the world’s second-largest 
prospective study on diet and cancer calculated that a reduction in processed meat 
consumption to less than twenty grams a day—less than a small matchbook-sized 
portion—would prevent more than 3 percent of all deaths.105 In the largest such 
investigation the NIH-AARP study of more than five hundred thousand Americans 
( see here) found the preventable fraction of deaths may be even higher. The 
researchers suggested, for example, that 20 percent of heart disease deaths among 
American women could be averted if the highest consumers of processed meat would 
cut down to the equivalent of less than a half strip of bacon a day.106 No wonder the 
American Institute for Cancer Research recommends that you simply “avoid 
processed meat such as ham, bacon, salami, hot dogs and sausages.”107 
Nitrites are added to cured meat as a “color fixative” and to help prevent the 
growth of botulism bacteria (a rare but serious paralytic illness).108 What about 
“uncured” bacon? It says right on the package: “No nitrites or nitrates added.” But 
study the fine print and you may see a little footnote that reads something like “except 
those naturally occurring in celery juice.” Vegetables do contain nitrates that can be 
fermented into nitrites, so adding fermented celery juice to bacon is just a sneaky way 
of adding nitrites. Even commentators in the journal Meat Science have realized this 
may be perceived by consumers as “incorrect at best or deceptive at worst.”109 
But the same fermentation that converts nitrates to nitrites can happen when you 
eat vegetables, thanks to bacteria on your tongue. So why are vegetable nitrates and 
nitrites okay but the same compounds from meat are linked to cancer?110 Because 
nitrites themselves are not carcinogenic; they turn into carcinogens. Nitrites only 
become harmful when they turn into nitrosamines and nitrosamides. For them to do 
that, amines and amides must be present, and amines and amides are found in 
abundance in animal products. This transformation can happen in the meat itself or in 
your stomach after you eat it. In the case of plant foods, the vitamin C and other 
antioxidants that are found naturally in them block the formation of these carcinogens 
in your body.111 This process would explain why intake of both nitrate and nitrite 
from processed meat has been linked to kidney cancer, but no increased risk was 
found for nitrate or nitrite intake from plant sources.112 
While nitrite from animal sources—not just processed meats—was associated 
with an increased risk of kidney cancer, some of the highest nitrate-containing 
vegetables, such as arugula, kale, and collards, are associated with significantly 
reduced risk for kidney cancer.113 
Kidneys are tasked with the monumental responsibility of filtering your blood all 
day, every day. That’s a lot of work for two fist-sized organs. Kidneys are extremely 
resilient, but they aren’t indestructible. When they begin to fail, the body can start 
failing too. Toxic substances that healthy kidneys would ordinarily filter out can pass 
through and build up in the bloodstream. 
To keep your kidneys strong and your blood clean, you must carefully consider 
what you eat. The meat-sweet American diet can slowly damage your kidneys one 
meal at a time, forcing the kidneys into a state of hyperfiltration. Imagine how long 
your car engine would last if you always revved it near the red line? Thankfully, 
medical science has proven that you can reduce your kidneys’ workload (and acid 
load) by moving toward a more plant-based diet. 
 CHAPTER 11 
How Not to Die from Breast Cancer 
“You have breast cancer.” 
These are among the most feared words a woman can hear, and for a good reason. 
Besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among American 
women. Every year, about 230,000 are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,000 die 
from it.1 
Breast cancer does not occur overnight. That lump you feel in the shower one 
morning may have started forming decades ago. By the time doctors detect the tumor, 
it may have been present for forty years or even longer.2 The cancer has been 
growing, maturing, and acquiring hundreds of new survival-of-the-fittest mutations 
that allow it to grow even more quickly as it tries to outmaneuver your immune 
system. 
The scary reality is that what doctors call “early detection” is actually late 
detection. Modern imaging simply isn’t good enough to detect cancer at its earliest 
stages, so it can spread long before it’s even spotted. A woman is considered 
“healthy” until she shows signs or symptoms of breast cancer. But if she has been 
harboring a malignancy for two decades, can she truly be considered healthy? 
People who are doing the right thing by improving their diets in hopes of 
preventing cancer may in fact be successfully treating it as well. Autopsy studies 
have shown that as many as 20 percent of women aged twenty to fifty-four who died 
from unrelated causes, such as car accidents, had so-called “occult” (or hidden) 
breast cancers growing inside them.3 Sometimes there’s nothing you can do to 
prevent the initiation stage of cancer, when that first normal breast cell mutates into a 
cancerous one. Some breast cancers may even start in the womb and be related to 
your mother’s diet.4 For this reason, we all need to choose a diet and lifestyle that not 
only prevents the initiation stage of cancer but also hampers the promotion stage, 
during which the cancer grows to a size large enough to pose a threat. 
The good news is that no matter what your mom ate or how you lived as a child, 
by eating and living healthfully, you may be able to slow the growth rate of any 
hidden cancers. In short, you can die with your tumors rather than from them. This is 
how dietary cancer prevention and treatment can end up being the same thing. 
One or two cancer cells never hurt anyone. But how about a billion cancer cells? 
That’s how many may be in a tumor5 by the time it’s picked up by a mammogram.6 
Like most tumors, breast cancer starts with just one cell, which divides to become 
two, four, and then eight. Every time breast cancer cells divide, the tumor can 
effectively double in size.7 
Let’s see how many times a tiny tumor has to double to get to a billion cells. Take 
out a calculator. Multiply one times two. Then multiply that number by two. Keep 
doing that until you reach one billion. Don’t worry. It won’t take long. It’s only thirty 
doublings. In just thirty doublings, a single cancer cell can turn into a billion. 
The key to how quickly you’d be diagnosed with cancer, then, is the doubling 
time. How long does it take tumors to double once? Breast cancers can double in size 
in anywhere from as few as twenty-five days8 to a thousand days or more.9 In other 
words, it could be two years, or it could be more than a hundred years, before a 
tumor starts to cause problems. 
Where you fall on that timescale—two years or a century—may depend in part on 
what you eat. 
When I was teen, I ate a lousy diet. One of my favorite meals was—no joke— 
chicken-fried steak. During my youth, I may have caused one of the cells in my colon 
or prostate to mutate. But I’ve been eating much healthier for the last twenty-five 
years. My hope is that even if I did initiate a cancerous growth, if I don’t promote it, I 
may be able to slow down its growth. I don’t care if I get diagnosed with cancer a 
hundred years from now. I don’t expect to be around at that point to worry about it. 
Current controversy over the cost and effectiveness of mammograms10 misses an 
important point: Breast cancer screening, by definition, does not prevent breast 
cancer. It can just pick up existing breast cancer. Based on autopsy studies, as many 
as 39 percent of women in their forties already have breast cancers growing within 
their bodies that may be simply too small to be detected by mammograms.11 That’s 
why you can’t just wait until diagnosis to start eating and living healthier. You should 
start tonight. 
RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER 
The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) is considered one of the world’s 
leading authorities on diet and cancer. Based on the best available research, it came 
up with ten recommendations for cancer prevention.12 Beyond never chewing 
tobacco, their bottom-line dietary message was: “Diets that revolve around whole 
plant foods—vegetables, whole grains, fruits and beans—cut the risk of many 
cancers, and other diseases as well.”13 
To demonstrate how dramatically lifestyle choices can impact breast cancer risk, 
over the course of about seven years, researchers followed a group of about thirty 
thousand postmenopausal women with no history of breast cancer. Achieving just 
three of the ten AICR recommendations—limiting alcohol, eating mostly plant foods, 
and maintaining a normal body weight—was associated with a 62 percent lower risk 
of breast cancer.14 Yes, three simple health behaviors appeared to cut risk by more 
than half. 
Remarkably, eating a plant-based diet along with walking every day can improve 
our cancer defenses within just two weeks. Researchers dripped the blood of women 
before and after fourteen days of healthy living onto breast cancer cells growing in 
petri dishes. The blood taken after they started eating healthier suppressed cancer 
growth significantly better and killed 20–30 percent more cancer cells than the blood 
taken from the same women just two weeks before.15 The researchers attributed this 
effect to a decrease in levels of a cancer-promoting growth hormone called IGF-1,16 
likely due to the reduced intake of animal protein.17 
What kind of blood do you want in your body—what kind of immune system? The 
kind of blood that just rolls over when new cancer cells pop up, or blood that 
circulates to every nook and cranny in your body with the power to slow down and 
stop cancer cells in their tracks? 
Alcohol 
In 2010, the official World Health Organization body that assesses cancer risks 
formally upgraded its classification of alcohol to a definitive human breast 
carcinogen.18 In 2014, it clarified its position by stating that, regarding breast cancer, 
no amount of alcohol is safe.19 
But what about drinking “responsibly”? In 2013, scientists published a 
compilation of more than one hundred studies on breast cancer and light drinking (up 
to one alcoholic beverage a day). The researchers had found a small but statistically 
significant increase in breast cancer risk even among women who had at most one 
drink per day (except, perhaps, for red wine—see box below). They estimated that, 
every year around the world, nearly five thousand breast cancer deaths may be 
attributable to light drinking.20 
The carcinogen isn’t alcohol itself. The culprit is actually the toxic breakdown 
product of alcohol called acetaldehyde, which can form in your mouth almost 
immediately after you take a sip. Experiments show that even holding a single 
teaspoon of hard liquor in your mouth for five seconds before spitting it out results in 
the production of potentially carcinogenic levels of acetaldehyde that lingers for 
more than ten minutes.21 
If even a single sip of alcohol might produce cancer-causing levels of 
acetaldehyde in the mouth, what about using mouthwash that contains alcohol? 
Researchers who tested the effects of a variety of retail mouthwashes and oral rinses 
concluded that, although the risk is slight, it is probably best to refrain from using 
such products if they contain alcohol.22 
Red Wine Versus White Wine 
The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study found that even less than one drink a day may be 
associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk.23 Interestingly, drinking only 
red wine was not associated with breast cancer risk. Why? A compound in red wine 
appears to suppress the activity of an enzyme called estrogen synthase, which breast 
tumors can use to create estrogen to fuel their own growth.24 This compound is found 
in the skin of the dark-purple grapes used to make red wine, which explains why 
white wine appears to provide no such benefit,25 since it’s produced without the skin. 
The researchers concluded that red wine may “ameliorate the elevated breast 
cancer risk associated with alcohol intake.”26 In other words, the grapes in red wine 
may help cancel out some of the cancer-causing effects of the alcohol. But you can 
reap the benefits without the risks associated with imbibing alcoholic beverages by 
simply drinking grape juice or, even better, eating the purple grapes themselves— 
preferably ones with seeds, as they appear to be most effective at suppressing 
estrogen synthase.27 
It’s good (and delicious) to know that strawberries,28 pomegranates,29 and plain 
white mushrooms30 may also suppress the potentially cancer-promoting enzyme. 
Melatonin and Breast Cancer Risk 
For billions of years, life on planet Earth evolved under conditions of about twelve 
hours of light and twelve hours of darkness. Humans controlled fire for cooking about 
a million years ago, but we’ve only been using candles for about five thousand years 
and electric lights for a mere century. In other words, our ancient ancestors lived half 
their lives in the dark. 
These days, though, because of the electric-light pollution at night, the only Milky 
Way your children may see is inside a candy wrapper. Electric lighting has enabled 
us to remain productive well into the wee hours, but might this unnatural nighttime 
light exposure have any adverse health effects? 
In philosophy, there’s a flawed argument called the appeal-to-nature fallacy, in 
which someone proposes that something is good merely because it’s natural. In 
biology, however, this may hold some truth. The conditions under which our bodies 
were finely tuned over millions of years can sometimes give us insight into our 
optimal functioning. For example, we evolved running around naked in equatorial 
Africa. Therefore, it’s not surprising that many of us modern humans become 
deficient in vitamin D (the “sunshine vitamin”) if we live in Northern climes or in 
countries where the culture dictates full-body coverings for women.31 
Could something as ubiquitous as the lightbulb be a mixed blessing? Right in the 
middle of your brain sits the pineal gland, your so-called third eye. It’s connected to 
your actual eyes and has just one function: to produce a hormone called melatonin. 
During the day, the pineal gland is inactive. But once the sky darkens, it activates and 
begins pumping melatonin into your bloodstream. You start getting tired, feel less 
alert, and start thinking about sleep. Melatonin secretion may peak between 2:00 A.M. 
and 5:00 A.M. and then shuts off at daybreak, which is your cue to wake up. The level 
of melatonin in your bloodstream is one of the ways your internal organs know what 
time it is. It functions as one hand on your circadian clock.32 
Besides helping to regulate your sleep, melatonin is thought to play another role— 
suppressing cancer growth. Think of melatonin as helping to put cancer cells to sleep 
at night.33 To see if this function applies to preventing breast cancer, researchers 
from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and elsewhere came up with the 
clever idea of studying blind women. The thought was that because blind women 
can’t see sunlight, their pineal glands never stop secreting melatonin into their 
bloodstreams. Sure enough, the researchers found that blind women may have just 
half the odds of breast cancer as sighted women.34 
Conversely, women who interrupt their melatonin production by working night 
shifts appear to be at increased risk for breast cancer.35 Even living on a particularly 
brightly lit street may affect the risk. Studies comparing nighttime satellite photos 
against breast cancer rates have found that people living in brighter neighborhoods 
tend to have a higher breast cancer risk.36,37,38 Therefore, it’s probably best to sleep 
without any lights on and with the blinds down, though the evidence to support these 
strategies is limited.39 
Melatonin production can be gauged by measuring the amount of melatonin 
excreted in our first pee in the morning. And, indeed, women with higher melatonin 
secretion have been found to have lower rates of breast cancer.40 Other than 
minimizing nighttime light exposure, is there anything else you can do to keep up your 
production of melatonin? Apparently so. In 2005, Japanese researchers reported an 
association between higher vegetable intake and higher melatonin levels in the 
urine.41 Is there anything in your diet that may lower melatonin production, thereby 
potentially increasing breast cancer risk? We didn’t know until a comprehensive 
study of diet and melatonin was published in 2009. Researchers at Harvard 
University asked nearly a thousand women about their consumption of thirty-eight 
different foods or food groups and measured their morning melatonin levels. Meat 
consumption was the only food significantly associated with lower melatonin 
production, for reasons that are yet unknown.42 
Minimizing melatonin disruption may therefore mean putting curtains on your 
windows, eating more vegetables, and lowering the curtain on eating too much meat. 
Exercise and Breast Cancer 
Physical activity is considered a promising preventive measure against breast 
cancer43 not only because it helps with weight control but because exercise tends to 
lower circulating estrogen levels.44 Five hours a week of vigorous aerobic exercise 
can lower estrogen and progesterone exposure by about 20 percent.45 But do you 
need to work out that long for it to be protective? 
Although even light exercise is associated with lowered risk of some other types 
of cancer, for breast cancer, leisurely strolls don’t appear to cut it.46 Even an hour a 
day of activities such as slow dancing or light housework may not help.47 According 
to the largest study ever published on the subject, only women who worked up a 
sweat at least five or more times a week appeared to get significant protection.48 
Moderately intense activity may offer as much benefit as vigorous exercise, though.49 
Walking at a moderate pace for an hour a day is considered a moderately intense 
level of exercise, but it wasn’t put to the test until a 2013 study reported that, indeed, 
walking an hour a day or more is associated with significantly lower breast cancer 
risk.50 
Darwin was right: It’s survival of the fittest—so get fit! 
Heterocyclic Amines 
In 1939, a curious finding was published in a paper titled “Presence of Cancer- 
Producing Substances in Roasted Food.” A researcher described how he could 
induce breast cancers in mice by painting their heads with extracts of roasted horse 
muscle.51 These “cancer-producing substances” have since been identified as 
heterocyclic amines (HCAs), described by the National Cancer Institute as 
“chemicals formed when muscle meat, including beef, pork, fish, and poultry, is 
cooked using high-temperature methods.”52 These cooking methods include roasting, 
pan frying, grilling, and baking. Eating boiled meat is probably the safest. People 
who eat meat that never goes above 212 degrees Fahrenheit produce urine and feces 
that are significantly less DNA-damaging compared to those eating meat dry-cooked 
at higher temperatures.53 This means they have fewer mutagenic substances flowing 
through their bloodstreams and coming in contact with their colons. On the other 
hand, baking chicken for as few as fifteen minutes at about 350 degrees Fahrenheit 
leads to HCA production.54 
These carcinogens are formed in a high-temperature chemical reaction between 
some of the components of muscle tissue. (The lack of some of these substances in 
plants may explain why even fried veggie burgers don’t contain measurable HCAs.)55 
The longer meat is cooked, the more HCAs form. This process may explain why 
eating well-done meat is associated with increased risk of cancers of the breast, 
colon, esophagus, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach.56 The situation creates what 
the Harvard Health Letter called a meat preparation “paradox”57: Cooking meat 
thoroughly reduces the risk of contracting foodborne infections (see chapter 5), but 
cooking meat too thoroughly may increase the risk of foodborne carcinogens. 
Just because heterocyclic amines cause cancer in rodents doesn’t mean they cause 
cancer in humans. In this case, though—it turns out people may be even more 
susceptible. The livers of rodents have shown an uncanny ability to detoxify 99 
percent of the HCAs scientists stuffed down the animals’ throats (a technique known 
as gavage).58 But then, in 2008, researchers discovered that the livers of humans fed 
cooked chicken were only able to detoxify about half of these carcinogens, suggesting 
that the cancer risk is far higher than was previously thought based on experiments in 
rats.59 
The carcinogens found in cooked meat are thought to explain why, as the Long 
Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported in 2007, women who eat more grilled, 
barbecued, or smoked meats over their lifetimes may have as much as 47 percent 
higher odds of breast cancer.60 And the Iowa Women’s Health Study found that 
women who ate their bacon, beefsteak, and burgers “very well done” had nearly five 
times the odds of getting breast cancer compared with women who preferred these 
meats served rare or medium.61 
To see what was happening inside the breast, researchers asked women 
undergoing breast-reduction surgery about their meat-cooking methods. The scientists 
were able to link the consumption of fried meat with the amount of DNA damage 
found within the women’s breast tissue,62 the type of damage that can potentially 
cause a normal cell to mutate into a cancer cell.63 
HCAs appear able both to initiate and to promote cancer growth. PhIP, one of the 
most abundant HCAs in cooked meat, was found to have potent estrogen-like effects, 
fueling human breast-cancer cell growth almost as powerfully as pure estrogen,64 on 
which most human breast tumors thrive. But that result was based on research in a 
petri dish. How do we know that cooked-meat carcinogens find their way into human 
breast ducts, where most breast cancers arise? We didn’t, until researchers measured 
the levels of PhIP in the breast milk of nonsmoking women. (HCAs are also found in 
cigarette smoke.)65 In this study, PhIP was found in the breast milk of women who ate 
meat at the same concentration known to significantly boost breast cancer cell 
growth.66 No trace of PhIP was found in the breast milk of the one vegetarian 
participant.67 
A similar finding was reported in a study comparing the levels of PhIP in 
people’s hair. The chemical was detected in hair samples of all six of the meat eaters 
tested, but in only one of the six vegetarians.68 (HCAs can also be found in fried 
eggs.)69 
Your body can rapidly rid itself of these toxins once exposure ceases. In fact, 
urine levels of PhIP can drop to zero within twenty-four hours of refraining from 
eating meat.70 So if you practice Meatless Mondays, the level of PhIP passing through 
your body may become undetectable by Tuesday morning. But diet is not the only 
source of PhIP. HCA levels in vegetarians who smoke may approach those of 
nonsmoking meat eaters.71 
The heterocyclic amine PhIP is not just a so-called complete carcinogen, able to 
both initiate cancers and then promote their growth. PhIP may also then facilitate 
cancer spread. Cancer develops in three major stages: 1) initiation, the irreversible 
DNA damage that starts the process; 2) promotion, the growth and division of the 
initiated cell into a tumor; and 3) progression, which can involve the invasion of the 
tumor into surrounding tissue and metastasis (spread) to other areas of the body. 
Scientists can test how invasive, or aggressive, a certain cancer is by putting its 
cells into an instrument called an invasion chamber. They place cancer cells on one 
side of a porous membrane and then gauge their ability to penetrate and spread 
through the membrane. When researchers placed metastatic breast cancer cells from a 
fifty-four-year-old woman in an invasion chamber all by themselves, relatively few 
were able to breach the barrier. But within seventy-two hours of adding PhIP to the 
chamber, the cancer cells became more invasive, crawling through the membrane at 
an accelerated rate.72 
PhIP in meat may therefore represent a three-strikes-you’re-out type of 
carcinogen, potentially involved in every stage of breast cancer development. Staying 
away from the stuff isn’t easy, though, eating the standard American diet. As the 
researchers note: “Exposure to PhIP is difficult to avoid because of its presence in 
many commonly consumed cooked meats, particularly chicken, beef and fish.”73 
Cholesterol 
Remember earlier when we discussed the American Institute for Cancer Research? A 
study found that following its guidelines for cancer prevention appeared to reduce not 
just breast cancer risk but also heart disease risk.74 What’s more, not only may eating 
healthier to prevent cancer help to prevent heart disease but eating to prevent heart 
disease may also help to prevent cancer. One of the reasons? Cholesterol may play a 
role in the development and progression of breast cancer.75 
Cancer appears to feed on cholesterol. LDL cholesterol stimulates the growth of 
breast cancer cells in a petri dish—they just gobble up the so-called bad cholesterol. 
Tumors may suck up so much cholesterol that cancer patients’ cholesterol levels tend 
to plummet as their cancer grows.76 This is not a good sign, as patient survival tends 
to be lowest when cholesterol uptake is highest.77 The cancer is thought to be using 
the cholesterol to make estrogen or to shore up tumor membranes to help the cancer 
migrate and invade more tissue.78 In other words, breast tumors may take advantage 
of high circulating cholesterol levels to fuel and accelerate their own growth.79 
Cancer’s hunger for cholesterol is such that pharmaceutical companies have 
considered using LDL cholesterol as a Trojan horse to deliver antitumor drugs to 
cancer cells.80 
Though data have been mixed, the largest study on cholesterol and cancer to date 
—including more than a million participants—found a 17 percent increased risk in 
women who had total cholesterol levels over 240 compared with women whose 
cholesterol was under 160.81 If lowering cholesterol may help lower breast cancer 
risk, what about taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs? 
Statins looked promising in petri-dish studies, but population studies comparing 
breast cancer rates among statin users and nonusers showed inconsistent results. 
Some suggested statins decreased breast cancer risk, while others showed increased 
risk. Nearly all these studies were relatively short term, however. Most considered 
five years to be long-term statin use, but breast cancer can take decades to develop.82 
The first major study on the breast cancer risk of statin use for ten years or longer 
was published in 2013. It found that women who had been taking statins for a decade 
or more had twice the risk of both common types of infiltrating breast cancer: 
invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma.83 The cholesterol drugs 
doubled the risk. If confirmed, the public health implications of these findings are 
immense: Approximately one in four women in the United States over the age of 
forty-five may be taking these drugs.84 
The number-one killer of women is heart disease, not breast cancer, so women 
still need to bring down their cholesterol. You can likely achieve this without drugs 
by eating a healthy enough plant-based diet. And certain plant foods may be 
particularly protective. 
PREVENTING (AND TREATING) BREAST CANCER BY 
EATING PLANTS 
Not long ago, I received a very moving note from Bettina, a woman who had been 
following my work on NutritionFacts.org. Bettina had been diagnosed with stage two 
“triple-negative” breast cancer—the hardest type to treat. She underwent eight 
months of treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. A breast cancer 
diagnosis is stressful enough, but the anxiety and depression can be compounded by 
this type of rigorous cancer regimen. 
Bettina, however, used the experience to make positive changes in her life. After 
watching a number of my videos, she started to eat healthier. She followed many of 
the recommendations you’ll find in this chapter for helping to prevent a recurrence of 
cancer, such as eating more broccoli and flaxseeds. The good news: Bettina has been 
cancer-free for more than three years now. 
Given all the studies I read through, it’s easy for me to forget that the statistics 
refer to people’s lives. Stories like Bettina’s help me put faces to all the dry facts 
and figures. When real people make real changes, they can see real results. 
Sadly, even after a breast cancer diagnosis, most women may not make the dietary 
changes that could help them most, such as consuming less meat and more fruits and 
vegetables.85 Maybe they don’t realize (or their doctors never told them) that a 
healthier lifestyle may improve their survival chances. For example, a study of nearly 
1,500 women found that remarkably simple behavior changes—such as eating just 
five or more servings of fruits and veggies per day along with walking for thirty 
minutes six days a week—were associated with a significant survival advantage. 
Those who followed these recommendations appeared to have nearly half the risk of 
dying from their cancer in the two years following diagnosis.86 
While stories like Bettina’s can help make the statistics more inspiring, it all has 
to come back to the science. Over time, what to eat and feed our families are life-or- 
death decisions. How else can we decide but based on the best available balance of 
evidence? 
Fiber 
Inadequate fiber consumption may also be a risk factor for breast cancer. 
Researchers at Yale University and elsewhere found that premenopausal women who 
ate more than about six grams of soluble fiber a day (the equivalent of about a single 
cup of black beans) had 62 percent lower odds of breast cancer compared with 
women who consumed less than around four grams a day. Fiber’s benefits appeared 
even more pronounced for estrogen-receptor-negative breast tumors, which are 
harder to treat: Premenopausal women on a higher fiber diet had 85 percent lower 
odds of that type of breast cancer.87 
How did the researchers arrive at these figures? The Yale study was what’s 
called a case-control study. Scientists compared the past diets of women who had 
breast cancer (the cases) to the past diets of similar women who did not have breast 
cancer (the controls) to try to tease out if there is something distinctive about the 
eating habits of women who developed the disease. The researchers found that 
certain women with breast cancer reported eating significantly less soluble fiber on 
average than the cancer-free women. Hence, soluble fiber may be protective. 
The women in the study weren’t getting their fiber from supplements, though; they 
were getting it from food. But this could mean that eating more fiber is merely 
evidence that the cancer-free women are eating more plant foods, the only place fiber 
is found naturally. Therefore, fiber itself might not be the active ingredient. Maybe 
there’s something else protective in plant foods. “On the other hand,” noted the 
researchers, “an increased consumption of fiber from foods of plant origin … may 
reflect a reduced consumption of foods of animal origin.…”88 In other words, maybe 
it’s not what they were eating more of but what they were eating less of. The reason 
high fiber intake is associated with less breast cancer may be because of more beans 
—or less bologna. 
Either way, an analysis of a dozen other breast cancer case-control studies 
reported similar findings, with lower breast cancer risk associated with indicators of 
fruit and vegetable intake, such as vitamin C intake, and higher breast cancer risk 
associated with higher saturated-fat intake (an indicator of meat, dairy, and 
processed food intake). And according to these studies, the more whole plant foods 
you eat, the better it is for your health: Every twenty grams of fiber intake per day 
was associated with a 15 percent lower risk of breast cancer.89 
One problem with case-control studies, though, is that they rely on people’s 
memory of what they’ve been eating, potentially introducing what’s known as “recall 
bias.” For example, if people with cancer are more likely to selectively remember 
more of the unhealthy things they ate, this skewed recall could artificially inflate the 
correlation between eating certain foods and cancer. Prospective cohort studies 
avoid this problem by following a group (cohort) of healthy women and their diets 
forward (prospectively) in time to see who gets cancer and who doesn’t. A 
compilation of ten such prospective cohort studies on breast cancer and fiber intake 
came up with similar results to the dozen case-control studies mentioned above, a 14 
percent lower risk of breast cancer for every twenty grams of fiber intake per day.90 
The relationship between more fiber and less breast cancer may not be a straight line, 
though. Breast cancer risk may not significantly fall until at least twenty-five grams of 
fiber a day is reached.91 
Unfortunately, the average American woman appears to eat less than fifteen grams 
of fiber per day—only about half the minimum daily recommendation.92 Even the 
average vegetarian in the United States may only get about twenty grams daily.93 
Healthier vegetarians, though, may average thirty-seven grams a day, and vegans 
forty-six grams daily.94 Meanwhile, the whole-food, plant-based diets used 
therapeutically to reverse chronic disease contain upward of sixty grams of fiber.95 
Peeling Back Breast Cancer 
“Does an Apple a Day Keep the Oncologist Away?” This was the title of a study 
published in the Annals of Oncology that set out to determine if eating an apple (or 
more) a day was associated with lower cancer risk. The results: Compared with 
people who average less than one apple a day, daily apple eaters had 24 percent 
lower odds of breast cancer, as well as significantly lower risks for ovarian cancer, 
laryngeal cancer, and colorectal cancer. The protective associations persisted even 
after considering these subjects’ intake of vegetables and other fruits, suggesting 
daily apple consumption was more than just an indicator of eating a healthier diet.96 
The cancer protection apples appear to offer is assumed to arise from their 
antioxidant properties. Apple antioxidants are concentrated in the peel, which makes 
sense: The skin is the fruit’s first line of defense against the outside world. Expose 
the inner flesh, and it starts to brown (oxidize) within moments. The antioxidant 
power of the peel may be between two times (Golden Delicious) to six times 
(Idared) greater than the pulp.97 
Beyond protecting against the initial free-radical hit to your DNA, apple extract 
has been shown to suppress the growth of both estrogen-receptor-positive and - 
negative breast cancer cells in a petri dish.98 When researchers at my alma mater, 
Cornell University, separately dripped extracts of peel and flesh from the same 
apples on cancer cells, the peel stopped cancer growth ten times more effectively.99 
Researchers found something in the peels of organic apples (presumably present 
in conventional ones as well) that appears to reactivate a tumor-suppressor gene 
called maspin (an acronym for mammary serine protease inhibitor). Maspin is one of 
the tools your body appears to use to keep breast cancer at bay. Breast cancer cells 
find a way to turn off this gene, but apple peels appear to be able to turn it back on. 
The researchers concluded that “apple peels should not be discarded from the 
diet.”100 
Preventing Breast Cancer by Any Greens Necessary 
Earlier, I discussed the 2007 study of Long Island women that linked breast cancer 
risk to the heterocyclic amines formed in meat. Older women consuming the most 
grilled, barbecued, or smoked meat over their lifetimes were found to have 47 
percent increased odds of breast cancer. Those with high meat intake who also had 
low fruit and vegetable intake had 74 percent higher odds.101 
Low fruit and vegetable intake may just be a sign of unhealthy habits overall, but 
increasing evidence suggests that there may be something in produce that is actively 
protective against breast cancer. For example, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli 
boost the activity of detoxifying enzymes in your liver. Research has shown that if 
you feed people broccoli and brussels sprouts, they clear caffeine more quickly— 
meaning that if you eat a lot of cruciferous vegetables, you’d have to drink more 
coffee to get the same buzz because your liver (the body’s purifier) has become so 
revved up.102 Might this process work for those cooked meat carcinogens as well? 
To find out, researchers fed a group of nonsmokers pan-fried meat. They then 
measured the levels of heterocyclic amines circulating in their bodies by sampling 
their urine. For two weeks, the study subjects added about three cups of broccoli and 
brussels sprouts to their daily diets and then ate the same meat meal. Though they 
consumed the same quantity of carcinogens, significantly less came out in their urine, 
consistent with the subjects’ broccoli-boosted liver detox ability.103 
What happened next was unexpected. The subjects stopped eating their veggies 
and, two weeks later, tried eating the meat meal again. Presumably, their ability to 
detox carcinogens would by then have reverted back down to baseline. But instead, 
the subjects’ liver function remained enhanced even weeks later. 104 This finding 
suggests that not only might a heaping side of broccoli with your steak decrease 
carcinogen exposure but also that eating your veggies days or even weeks before the 
big barbecue may help shore up your defenses. Choosing the veggie burger may be 
the safest choice, though, as it may have no heterocyclic amines to detoxify.105 
So are women who eat a lot of green vegetables less likely to get breast cancer? 
A study of fifty thousand African American women (a sadly neglected demographic 
in medical research, but a population group who tends to regularly eat more greens) 
found that those who ate two or more servings of vegetables a day had a significantly 
decreased risk of a kind of breast cancer that’s hard to treat, estrogen- and 
progesterone-receptor-negative.106 Broccoli appeared especially protective among 
premenopausal women, but collard green consumption was associated with less 
breast cancer risk at all ages.107 
Breast Cancer Stem Cells 
What if you’re already fighting breast cancer or are in remission? Green vegetables 
may still be protective. Over the past decade, scientists have been developing a new 
theory of cancer biology based on the role of stem cells. Stem cells are essentially 
the body’s raw materials—the “parents” from which all other cells with specialized 
functions are generated. As a result, stem cells are a critical component of the body’s 
repair system, including regrowing skin, bone, and muscle. Breast tissue naturally has 
many stem cells in reserve, which are used during pregnancy to create new milk 
glands.108 However, as miraculous as stem cells are, their immortality can also work 
against us. Instead of rebuilding organs, if they turn cancerous, they can build 
tumors.109 
Cancerous stem cells may be why breast cancer can return, even up to twenty-five 
years after being fought off successfully the first time.110 When people are told that 
they are cancer-free, it may mean their tumors are gone, but if their stem cells are 
cancerous, the tumors still might reappear many years later. Sadly, someone who has 
been cancer-free for ten years might consider herself cured but actually may just be in 
remission. Smoldering cancerous stem cells may be just waiting to reignite. 
The current battery of sophisticated chemo drugs and radiation regimens is based 
on animal models. Success of a given treatment is often measured by its ability to 
shrink tumors in rodents—but rats in laboratories only live for about two or three 
years in any case. Doctors may be shrinking tumors, but mutated stem cells may still 
be lurking, able to slowly rebuild new tumors over the ensuing years.111 
What we need to do is strike at the root of cancer. We need to devise treatments 
aimed not just at reducing tumor bulk but at targeting what has been called the 
“beating heart of the tumor”:112 cancer stem cells. 
That’s where broccoli may come in. 
Sulforaphane, a dietary component of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, has 
been shown to suppress the ability of breast cancer stem cells to form tumors.113 This 
means that if you’re currently in remission, eating lots of broccoli could theoretically 
help keep your cancer from returning. (I say theoretically because those results were 
from a petri dish.) 
To be useful as a cancer fighter, sulforaphane would have to first be absorbed 
into your bloodstream when you eat broccoli. Then it would have to build up to the 
same concentration in breast tissue found to counter cancer stem cells in the lab. Is 
that possible? An innovative group at Johns Hopkins University sought to find out. 
The researchers asked women scheduled for breast reduction surgery to drink 
broccoli-sprout juice an hour before their procedure. Sure enough, after dissecting 
their breast tissue postsurgery, the researchers found evidence of significant 
sulforaphane buildup.114 In other words, we now know that the cancer-fighting 
nutrients in broccoli do find their way to the right place when we swallow them. 
To reach the concentration of sulforaphane in the breast found to suppress breast 
cancer stem cells, however, you would have to eat at least a quarter-cup of broccoli 
sprouts a day.115 You can buy broccoli sprouts in the produce aisle, but they are 
cheap and easy to grow at home. They have a bit of a radishy bite to them, so I like to 
mix them into a salad to dilute their intensity. 
There have yet to be randomized clinical trials to see if breast cancer survivors 
who eat broccoli live longer than those who don’t, but with no downside and only 
positive side effects, eating broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables is something I 
would recommend for everyone. 
Flaxseeds 
Flaxseeds are one of the first items ever considered to be health foods, treasured for 
their purported healing properties since at least the times of ancient Greece, when the 
renowned physician Hippocrates wrote about using them to treat patients.116 
Better known as one of the richest plant sources of essential omega-3 fatty acids, 
flaxseeds are really set apart by their lignan content. Though lignans are found 
throughout the plant kingdom, flaxseeds have around one hundred times more lignans 
than other foods.117 What are lignans? 
Lignans are phytoestrogens that can dampen the effects of the body’s own 
estrogen. This is why flaxseeds are considered a first-line medical therapy for 
menstrual breast pain.118 In terms of breast cancer risk, eating about a daily 
tablespoonful of ground flaxseeds can extend a woman’s menstrual cycle by about a 
day.119 This means she’ll have fewer periods over the course of a lifetime and, 
therefore, presumably less estrogen exposure and reduced breast cancer risk.120 Just 
as broccoli doesn’t technically contain sulforaphane (only the precursors that turn 
into sulforaphane when chewed—see here), flaxseeds don’t contain lignans, only 
lignan precursors, which need to be activated. This task is performed by the good 
bacteria in your gut. 
The gut bacteria’s role may help explain why women with frequent urinary tract 
infections may be at a higher risk of breast cancer: Every course of antibiotics you 
take can kill bacteria indiscriminately, meaning it may stymie the ability of the good 
bacteria in your gut to take full advantage of the lignans in your diet.121 (Yet another 
reason you should take antibiotics only when necessary.) 
Lignan intake is associated with significantly reduced breast cancer risk in 
postmenopausal women.122 This effect is presumed to be due to lignans’ further 
estrogen-dampening effects. But since lignans are found in healthy foods like berries, 
whole grains, and dark, leafy greens, could they just be an indicator of a healthy diet? 
In a petri dish, lignans do directly suppress the proliferation of breast cancer 
cells.123 But the strongest evidence to date that there really is something special about 
this class of phytonutrients comes from interventional trials, starting with a 2010 
study funded by the National Cancer Institute. Researchers took about forty-five 
women at high risk of breast cancer—meaning they had suspicious breast biopsies or 
had previously suffered from breast cancer—and gave them the equivalent of about 
two teaspoons of ground flaxseeds every day. Needle biopsies of breast tissue were 
taken before and after the yearlong study. The results: On average, the women had 
fewer precancerous changes in their breasts after the year of flax lignans than before 
they started. Eighty percent (thirty-six of forty-five) had a drop in their levels of Ki- 
67, a biomarker (indicator) of increased cell proliferation. This finding suggests that 
sprinkling a few spoonfuls of ground flaxseeds on your oatmeal or whatever you’re 
eating throughout the day may reduce the risk of breast cancer.124 
What about women who already have breast cancer? Breast cancer survivors who 
have higher levels of lignans in their bloodstreams125,126 and diets127 appear to 
survive significantly longer. This outcome may be due to the fact that women who eat 
flaxseeds may also see a rise in the levels of endostatin in their breasts.128 
(Endostatin is a protein produced by your body to help starve tumors of their blood 
supply.) 
The evidence from studies like these appeared so compelling that scientists 
performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of flaxseeds 
for breast cancer patients—one of the few times a food has ever been so rigorously 
put to the test. Researchers located women with breast cancer scheduled for surgery 
and divided them randomly into two groups: Every day, group one ate a muffin 
containing flaxseed, while group two ate a muffin that looked and tasted the same, but 
had no flaxseed in it. Biopsies of the tumors in the flax and no-flax groups were taken 
at the beginning of the study and then compared with the pathology of the tumor 
removed during surgery about five weeks later. 
Was there any difference? Compared with the women who ate the placebo 
muffins, women consuming the muffins with flaxseed, on average, witnessed their 
tumor-cell proliferation decrease, cancer-cell death rates increase, and their c-erB2 
scores go down. C-erB2 is a marker of cancer aggressiveness; the higher your score, 
the higher the potential for breast cancer to metastasize and spread throughout the 
body. In other words, the flaxseeds appeared to make the subjects’ cancer less 
aggressive. The researchers concluded, “Dietary flaxseed has the potential to reduce 
tumor growth in patients with breast cancer.… [F]laxseed, which is inexpensive and 
readily available, may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used 
breast cancer drugs.”129 
Soy and Breast Cancer 
Soybeans naturally contain another class of phytoestrogens called isoflavones. 
People hear the word “estrogen” in the word “phytoestrogens” and assume that 
means soy has estrogen-like effects. Not necessarily. Phytoestrogens dock into the 
same receptors as your own estrogen but have a weaker effect, so they can act to 
block the effects of your more powerful animal estrogen. 
There are two types of estrogen receptors in the body, alpha and beta. Your own 
estrogen prefers alpha receptors, while plant estrogens (phytoestrogens) have an 
affinity for the beta receptors.130 The effects of soy phytoestrogens on different 
tissues therefore depend on the ratio of alpha to beta receptors.131 
Estrogen has positive effects in some tissues and potentially negative effects in 
others. For example, high levels of estrogen can be good for the bones but can 
increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer. Ideally, you’d like what’s called 
a “selective estrogen receptor modulator” in your body that would have 
proestrogenic effects in some tissues and antiestrogenic effects in others. 
Well, that’s what soy phytoestrogens appear to be. 132 Soy seems to lower breast 
cancer risk,133 an antiestrogenic effect, but can also help reduce menopausal hot-flash 
symptoms,134 a proestrogenic effect. So, by eating soy, you may be able to enjoy the 
best of both worlds. 
What about soy for women with breast cancer? There have been five studies on 
breast cancer survivors and soy consumption. Overall, researchers have found that 
women diagnosed with breast cancer who ate the most soy lived significantly longer 
and had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer recurrence than those who ate 
less.135 The quantity of phytoestrogens found in just a single cup of soy milk136 may 
reduce the risk of breast cancer returning by 25 percent.137 The improvement in 
survival for those eating more soy foods was found both in women whose tumors 
were responsive to estrogen (estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer) and those 
whose tumors were not (estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer). This also held 
true for both young women and older women.138 In one study, for example, 90 percent 
of the breast cancer patients who ate the most soy phytoestrogens after diagnosis 
were still alive five years later, while half of those who ate little to no soy were 
dead.139 
One way soy may decrease cancer risk and improve survival is by helping to 
reactivate BRCA genes.140 BRCA1 and BRCA2 are so-called caretaker genes, 
cancer-suppressing genes responsible for DNA repair. Mutations in this gene can 
cause a rare form of hereditary breast cancer. As has been well publicized, Angelina 
Jolie decided to undergo a preventive double mastectomy. A National Breast Cancer 
Coalition survey found that the majority of women believe that most breast cancers 
occur among women with a family history or a genetic predisposition to the 
disease.141 The reality is that as few as 2.5 percent of breast cancer cases are 
attributable to breast cancer running in the family.142 
If the vast majority of breast cancer patients have fully functional BRCA genes, 
meaning that their DNA-repair mechanisms are intact, how did their breast cancer 
form, grow, and spread? Breast tumors appear able to suppress the expression of the 
gene through a process called methylation. While the gene itself is operational, the 
cancer has effectively turned it off or at least turned down its expression, potentially 
aiding the metastatic spread of a tumor.143 That’s where soy may come in. 
The isoflavones in soy appear to help turn BRCA protection back on, removing 
the methyl straitjacket the tumor tried to place on it.144 The dose breast cancer 
researchers used to achieve this result in vitro was pretty hefty, though—the 
equivalent to eating about a cup of soybeans. 
Soy may also help women with variations of other breast cancer susceptibility 
genes known as MDM2 and CYP1B1. Women at increased genetic risk of breast 
cancer may therefore especially benefit from high soy intake.145 The bottom line is 
that no matter which genes you inherit, changes in your diet may be able to affect 
DNA expression at a genetic level, potentially boosting your ability to fight disease. 
Why Do Women in Asia Have Less Breast Cancer? 
Though breast cancer is the most common cancer specific to women globally, Asian 
women are up to five times less likely to develop breast cancer than North American 
women.146 Why? 
One possibility is their intake of green tea, a common staple in many Asian diets. 
Green tea has been associated with about a 30 percent reduction in breast cancer 
risk.147 Another strong possibility is a relatively high intake of soy, which, if 
consumed consistently during childhood, may cut the risk of breast cancer later in life 
by half. If women consume soy primarily as an adult, though, their risk reduction may 
only be closer to 25 percent.148 
While intake of green tea and soy might account for a twofold reduction in Asian 
women’s breast cancer risk, it doesn’t fully account for the disparity between Eastern 
and Western breast cancer rates. 
Asian populations also eat more mushrooms.149 As noted in the box on red wine 
here, white mushrooms have also been shown to block the estrogen synthase enzyme, 
at least in a petri dish. So researchers decided to investigate if there was a link 
between mushroom intake and breast cancer. They compared the mushroom 
consumption of one thousand breast cancer patients to one thousand healthy subjects 
of similar age, weight, and smoking and exercise status. The women whose 
mushroom consumption averaged just about one-half a mushroom or more per day 
had 64 percent lower odds of breast cancer compared with women who didn’t eat 
mushrooms at all. Eating mushrooms and sipping at least half a tea bag’s worth of 
green tea each day was associated with nearly 90 percent lower breast cancer 
odds.150 
Oncologists, doctors who treat cancer, can take pride in the strides they’ve made. 
Thanks to improvements in cancer treatment, cancer patients are living longer and 
healthier as has been celebrated in oncology journal editorials with such titles as 
“Cancer Survivors, 10 Million Strong and Growing!” Yes, more than 10 million 
cancer patients are still alive today, with “perhaps as many as 1 million new 
individuals in the United States joining those ranks each year.”151 That is an 
accomplishment, but wouldn’t it be even better to prevent those million cases in the 
first place? 
In medicine, a cancer diagnosis is considered a “teachable moment” when we can 
motivate a patient to improve his or her lifestyle.152 By then, though, it may already 
be too late. 
 CHAPTER 12 
How Not to Die from Suicidal Depression 
Healthy food can have a powerful effect on mood. But don’t take only my word for it. 
Take Margaret’s too. After hearing me speak at her church, she sent me this e-mail: 
Dear Dr. Greger, 
I was diagnosed with clinical depression by a psychiatrist when I was ten years old. I spent all my teenage 
years and twenties on a cocktail of medications for depression. Even on medications, I was still haunted by 
intrusive thoughts of suicide on a daily basis. Worse yet, the medications gave me headaches, nausea, and 
vivid, often frightening, dreams. I was sleepy all the time, and despite the scary dreams, I had to nap every 
day. I slept a lot—a couple of hours midday and then close to ten hours every night. Even with these side 
effects, I was afraid not to take these medications because I really wanted to live, and I was scared that 
without meds I might get so depressed I would kill myself. 
Eventually I got married … and divorced. Was hospitalized several times during my marriage for 
depression. To be honest, I just never had any sex drive, and my husband took it personally. I guess I’ll 
never know if my missing libido was just a side effect of all the medications I was on or the depression itself. 
About nine years ago, I heard you speak at my church. I realized I had just spent the last two decades in 
a medication-induced haze. And without ever really feeling good a single one of those days. I talked to my 
psychiatrist about how I wanted to completely overhaul my diet and try to back off the medications under 
her supervision. Much to my surprise, she was supportive. Well, I’ve been whole food and plant based for 
nine years and haven’t had a further relapse. Not that I haven’t been sad from time to time but I haven’t 
had any more thoughts of suicide or any more hospitalizations. I sleep like a normal person now! Everyone 
tells me I am a different person since I changed my diet. I just wanted to thank you. My fiancé would like to 
thank you too! I owe you my life! 
How can you prevent death by suicide? For those unfamiliar with the ravages of 
mental illness, the flippant answer is: Just don’t do it. In fact, death from other 
leading killers, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, may be just 
as much a choice as death from suicide, since psychiatric disorders can cloud your 
judgment. Nearly forty thousand Americans take their own lives each year,1 and 
depression appears to be a leading cause.2 Thankfully, lifestyle interventions can 
help repair your mind as well as your body. 
In 1946, the World Health Organization defined health as “a state of complete 
physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or 
infirmity.”3 In other words, you can be in excellent physical shape—enjoying low 
cholesterol, a healthy body weight, and good overall physical fitness—but that 
doesn’t necessarily mean you’re healthy. Mental health can be just as important as 
physical health. 
Major depression is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses. An 
estimated 7 percent of American adults suffer from serious depression—that’s about 
sixteen million people who have at least one depressive episode each year.4 Now, 
everyone feels sad occasionally. A full range of emotions is part of what makes us 
human. Depression, however, is not just sadness. It is characterized by weeks of such 
symptoms as low or sad mood, diminished interest in activities that used to be 
pleasurable, weight gain or loss, fatigue, inappropriate guilt, difficulty concentrating, 
and recurrent thoughts of death. 
Indeed, major depression can be a life-threatening ailment. 
Good mental health isn’t “merely the absence of disease,” though. Just because 
you’re not depressed doesn’t necessarily mean you’re happy. There are twenty times 
more studies published on health and depression than there are on health and 
happiness.5 In recent years, however, the field of “positive psychology” has emerged, 
focusing on the relationship between optimal mental and physical health. 
Growing evidence indicates that positive psychological well-being is associated 
with reduced risk of physical illness, but which came first? Are people healthier 
because they’re happy, or are people just happier because they’re healthy? 
Prospective studies that follow individuals over time have found that people 
starting out happier do indeed end up healthier. An analysis of seventy such studies 
on mortality concluded that “positive psychological well-being has a favorable effect 
on survival in both healthy and diseased populations.”6 Those who are happier 
appear to live longer. 
Not so fast, though. While positive mental states may be associated with less 
stress and more resilience to infection, positive well-being might also be 
accompanied by a healthy lifestyle. In general, people who feel satisfied appear to 
smoke less, exercise more, and eat healthier.7 So is being happier just a marker of 
good health and not a cause of it? To find out, researchers set out to make people 
sick. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University took hundreds of individuals—some 
happy, some unhappy—and paid them $800 each to be allowed to drip the common 
cold virus into their noses. Even if someone with a cold sneezes right into your face 
and the virus gets into your nose, you won’t get sick automatically, because your 
immune system may be able to fight it off. So the study question was: Whose immune 
system would be better at fighting off a common virus—those in the group initially 
rated as happy, peppy, and relaxed, or those in the group who were anxious, hostile, 
and depressed? 
About one in three of the negative-emotion individuals failed to successfully fight 
off the virus and came down with a cold. But only one in five of the happy 
individuals became sick, even after the researchers took into account such factors as 
subjects’ sleep patterns, exercise habits, and stress levels.8 In a subsequent study, the 
researchers even exposed subjects (who had also been paid) to the influenza virus, a 
more serious infection. Once again, increased positive emotions were associated 
with decreased verified illness rates.9 Happier people, it seems, are less likely to get 
sick. 
So mental health does appear to play a part in physical health. That’s why it’s 
crucial that the food you eat support both your mind and your body. As you’ll see, 
common foods from leafy green vegetables to your basic garden-variety tomato may 
positively affect your brain chemistry and help ward off depression. In fact, even 
simply smelling a common spice may improve your emotional state. 
But avoiding the blues is not just about eating your greens. There are also 
components in certain foods that may increase the risk of depression, such as 
arachidonic acid, an inflammation-promoting compound found mostly in chicken and 
eggs in the diet that is blamed for potentially impairing mood by inflaming the brain. 
Arachidonic Acid 
Studies on the emotional health and mood states of those eating plant-based diets 
suggest that eating less meat isn’t just good for us physically; it’s good for us 
emotionally too. Researchers employed two psychological tests, the Profile of Mood 
States (POMS) and the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). POMS 
measures levels of depression, anger, hostility, fatigue, and confusion. The DASS 
gauges other negative mood states as well, including hopelessness, lack of interest, 
anhedonia (lack of pleasure), agitation, irritability, and impatience with other people. 
Subjects eating plant-based diets appeared to experience significantly fewer negative 
emotions than omnivores. Those eating better also reported feeling more “vigor.”10 
The researchers offered two explanations for their findings. First, people eating 
better diets may be happier because they’re healthier.11 Those eating plant-based 
diets don’t just have lower rates of many of the leading killer diseases but also 
appear to have lower rates of such annoying ills as hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and 
ulcers; fewer surgeries; fewer hospitalizations; and only about half the odds of being 
on drugs, including tranquilizers, aspirin, insulin, blood pressure pills, pain 
medications, antacids, laxatives, or sleeping pills.12 (Being able to avoid doctor 
visits and health insurance hassles would make anyone less irritable, stressed, and 
depressed!) 
The researchers also suggested a more direct explanation for their results: Maybe 
the proinflammatory compound arachidonic acid found in animal products can 
“adversely impact mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation.”13 The body 
metabolizes arachidonic acid into an array of inflammatory chemicals. In fact, that’s 
how anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen work to relieve pain and 
swelling—by blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid into these inflammatory 
end products. Maybe the mental health of omnivores was being comparatively 
compromised by inflammation in their brains. 
Inflammation isn’t always bad, of course. When the area around a splinter gets all 
red, hot, and swollen, it’s a sign that the body is using arachidonic acid to mount an 
inflammatory response to help fight off infection. But your body already makes all the 
arachidonic acid you need, so you don’t need to take in any more via your diet.14 In 
this way, arachidonic acid resembles cholesterol, another essential component that 
the body makes all on its own: When you add excess amounts through diet, it may 
upset your system’s internal balance.15 In this particular case, the researchers 
suspected arachidonic acid intake might impair the body’s emotional state. There are 
data suggesting that people with higher levels of arachidonic acid in their blood may 
end up at significantly higher risk of suicide and episodes of major depression.16 
The top-five sources of arachidonic acid in the American diet are chicken, eggs, 
beef, pork, and fish, although chicken and eggs alone contribute more than the other 
top sources combined.17 Just a single egg’s worth of arachidonic acid a day may 
significantly raise arachidonic acid levels in the blood.18 Overall, omnivores appear 
to consume about nine times more arachidonic acid than those eating plant-based 
diets.19 
The study showing improved moods and emotional states in those eating plant- 
based diets was a cross-sectional study, meaning it was a snapshot in time. What if 
people who start out mentally healthier go on to eat healthier, too, and not the other 
way around? To show cause and effect, researchers would have to perform an 
interventional study, the gold standard of nutritional science: Gather subjects, change 
their diets, and see what happens. The same research team did just that. They took 
men and women who ate meat at least once a day and took away their eggs and 
chicken, along with other meats, to see what would happen to their moods. Within 
just two weeks, the study subjects experienced a significant improvement in measures 
of their mood states.20 The researchers concluded: “Perhaps eating less meat can 
help protect mood in omnivores, particularly important in those susceptible to 
affective disorders [such as depression].”21 
Given these results, another research team decided to put a healthy diet to the test 
in a workplace setting, where healthy bodies and minds could potentially translate 
into improved productivity—and elevate the mood of shareholders as well. A group 
of overweight and diabetic employees at a major insurance company was encouraged 
to follow a whole-food, plant-based diet, cutting out all meat, eggs, dairy, oil, and 
junk foods. There was no portion-size restriction, no calorie counting, and no carb 
tracking, and participants were explicitly told not to change their exercise habits. 
Meals were not provided, but the company cafeteria did start offering such daily 
options as bean burritos and lentil and minestrone soups. A control group of 
employees received no dietary advice.22 
Despite the dietary restrictions, over the course of about five months, the plant- 
eating group reported greater diet satisfaction than the control group. How well did 
they do? The plant-based group experienced improved digestion, increased energy, 
and better sleep, as well as significant improvement in their physical functioning, 
general health, vitality, and mental health. No surprise, then, that they showed 
measurable improvements in work productivity too.23 
Based on this success, a much larger study of plant-based nutrition was conducted 
at ten corporate locations across the country from San Diego, California, to Macon, 
Georgia. The same resounding success was reported, showing improvements not only 
in subjects’ body weight, blood sugar levels, and ability to control cholesterol 24 but 
also in their emotional states, including depression, anxiety, fatigue, sense of well- 
being, and daily functioning.25 
Fighting the Blues with Greens 
Here’s a statistic you probably haven’t heard: Higher consumption of vegetables may 
cut the odds of developing depression by as much as 62 percent.26 A review in the 
journal Nutritional Neuroscience concluded that, in general, eating lots of fruits and 
veggies may present “a non-invasive, natural, and inexpensive therapeutic means to 
support a healthy brain.”27 
But how, exactly? 
The traditional explanation of how depression works, known as the monoamine 
theory, proposes that the condition arises out of a chemical imbalance in the brain. 
The billions of nerves in your brain communicate with each other using chemicals 
called neurotransmitters. Your nerve cells don’t physically touch one another. 
Instead, they manufacture and deploy neurotransmitters to bridge the gap between 
them. The levels of an important class of neurotransmitters called monoamines, 
which includes serotonin and dopamine, are controlled by an enzyme called 
monoamine oxidase (known as MAO) that breaks down any excess monoamines. 
People who are depressed appear to have elevated levels of this enzyme in their 
brains.28 Thus, the theory goes, depression is caused by abnormally low levels of 
monoamine neurotransmitters due to elevated levels of the neurotransmitter-munching 
enzyme. 
Antidepressant medications were developed to try to boost the levels of 
neurotransmitters to offset their accelerated breakdown. But if the excess MAO is 
responsible for depression, why not just develop a drug that blocks this enzyme? 
Such drugs do exist, but they have serious risks—not the least of which is the 
dreaded “cheese effect,” in which eating certain foods (such as certain cheeses, 
cured meats, and fermented foods) while on the drug can potentially cause fatal brain 
hemorrhaging.29 
If only there were a way to tamp down the monoamine oxidase enzyme safely. 
Well, it turns out that many plant foods, including apples, berries, grapes, onions, and 
green tea, contain phytonutrients that appear to naturally inhibit the MAO, as do such 
spices as cloves, oregano, cinnamon, and nutmeg.30 This may help explain why those 
eating plant-rich diets have lower rates of depression.31 
Even on a day-to-day basis, studies have shown that the more fruits and 
vegetables you eat, the happier, calmer, and more energetic you may feel that day— 
and this positivity can spill over into the next day. For your diet to have a meaningful 
psychological impact, though, you may need to consume approximately seven 
servings of fruits or eight servings of vegetables each day.32 
Seeds and Serotonin 
Although some plant foods contain significant amounts of serotonin,33 the so-called 
happiness hormone, serotonin can’t cross the blood-brain barrier. This means that 
dietary sources of serotonin can’t make it into the brain, but the building block of 
serotonin, an amino acid called tryptophan, can get from your mouth to your blood to 
your brain. Tryptophan depletion experiments in the 1970s showed that people given 
specially concocted tryptophan-deficient diets suffered from irritability, anger, and 
depression.34 So if you give people extra tryptophan, will they feel better? 
That’s the theory. However, in the 1980s, certain tryptophan supplements created 
a debacle, causing a rash of deaths.35 But if tryptophan is an amino acid and if 
proteins are made out of amino acids, why can’t you just give people high-protein 
meals to boost their serotonin levels by delivering extra tryptophan to the brain? It’s 
been tried, and it’s failed,36 likely because other amino acids in protein-rich foods 
crowd out the tryptophan for access to the brain. However, carbohydrate ingestion 
does the opposite: It helps shunt many nontryptophan amino acids out from the 
bloodstream and into the muscles, allowing tryptophan greater access into the brain. 
For example, having a carb-rich breakfast like waffles and orange juice resulted in 
higher tryptophan levels in those studied than did a protein-rich breakfast of turkey, 
eggs, and cheese.37 
This principle may explain why women suffering from premenstrual syndrome 
(PMS) sometimes crave carbohydrate-rich food. Consumption of even a single carb- 
rich, protein-poor meal has been shown to improve depression, tension, anger, 
confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores among women with 
PMS.38 In a yearlong study, about one hundred men and women were randomly 
assigned to eat either a low-carb or high-carb diet. By the end of the year, the 
subjects eating the high-carb diets experienced significantly less depression, 
hostility, and mood disturbance than those in the low-carb group. This result is 
consistent with studies finding better moods and less anxiety among populations 
eating diets higher in carbohydrates and lower in fats and protein.39 
Carbohydrates may facilitate tryptophan transport into the brain, but you would 
still need a dietary source. Ideally, it would have a high tryptophan-to-protein ratio to 
facilitate brain access.40 Such seeds as sesame, sunflower, or pumpkin may fit the 
bill. Indeed, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of butternut squash seeds for 
social anxiety disorder reported a significant improvement in an objective 
measurement in anxiety within an hour of consumption.41 All of these factors may 
contribute to the comprehensive improvement in mood one may achieve after just a 
few weeks on a plant-based diet.42 
Saffron 
The earliest recorded medical use of a spice appears to be more than 3,600 years 
ago, when saffron was evidently first used for healing.43 A few thousand years later, 
scientists finally put saffron to the test in a head-to-head trial against the 
antidepressant drug Prozac for the treatment of clinical depression. Both the spice 
and the drug worked equally well in reducing depression symptoms.44 As you can see 
in the box here, this may not be saying much, but at the very least, the saffron was 
safer in terms of side effects. For example, 20 percent of people in the Prozac group 
suffered sexual dysfunction, a common occurrence with many antidepressant 
medications, whereas no one in the saffron group did. 
However, saffron may be one of those rare cases in which the natural remedy is 
more expensive than the drug. Saffron is the world’s most expensive spice. It is 
harvested from crocus flowers, specifically the dried stigmas (the threadlike tips 
inside the flower), which are ground up to make the spice. You need more than fifty 
thousand crocuses—enough to cover a football field—to produce just a single pound 
of saffron.45 
A Prozac-equivalent dose of saffron may cost more than twice as much as the 
drug, but a subsequent study found that even just smelling saffron appeared to have 
psychological benefits. Though researchers diluted the spice so much that the study 
subjects couldn’t detect its odor, they still noted a significant drop in stress hormones 
measured in women who sniffed the saffron for twenty minutes compared with those 
who spent twenty minutes smelling a placebo, along with significant improvement in 
the women’s symptoms of anxiety.46 
So if you’re feeling anxious, perhaps wake up and smell the saffron. 
Coffee and Aspartame 
Speaking of waking up to pleasant aromas, a cup of coffee may be doing more for the 
brain than making it feel less groggy in the morning. Researchers from Harvard 
University looked at data from three large-scale cohort studies of more than two 
hundred thousand American men and women. They found that people who drank two 
or more cups of coffee daily appeared to have about only half the suicide risk 
compared to non-coffee drinkers.47 What about drinking more than four cups a day? 
A Kaiser Permanente study of more than one hundred thousand people found that 
suicide risk seemed to continue to drop with increases in coffee dose. People who 
drank more than six cups a day were 80 percent less likely to commit suicide,48 
though drinking eight or more cups a day has been associated with increased suicide 
risk.49 
What you put in your coffee may also make a difference. The NIH-AARP study, 
which followed hundreds of thousands of Americans for a decade, found that frequent 
consumption of sweetened beverages may increase the risk of depression among 
older adults. Indeed, adding sugar to coffee may negate many of its positive effects on 
mood, and adding the artificial sweetener aspartame (found in Equal and 
NutraSweet) or saccharine (in Sweet’n Low) was associated with an increased risk 
of depression.50 
The controversy surrounding the neurological effects of aspartame began in the 
1980s.51 At first, concern was limited to those with preexisting mental illness. An 
early study at Case Western Reserve University was halted prematurely for safety 
reasons because subjects with a history of depression appeared to be experiencing 
such severe reactions to the sweetener. The researchers concluded that “individuals 
with mood disorders are particularly sensitive to this artificial sweetener and its use 
in this population should be discouraged.”52 
Only recently were the neurobehavioral effects of aspartame investigated in a 
population free from mental illness. Healthy individuals were split into two groups— 
half were given a higher dose of aspartame (the equivalent of about three liters of 
Diet Coke’s worth) and the other half received a lower dose (a single liter of Diet 
Coke’s worth). Then the groups switched.53 Bear in mind that the higher-aspartame 
diet contained just half the acceptable daily intake of the stuff, as determined by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration.54 After only eight days on the higher-aspartame 
dose, participants exhibited more depression and irritability and performed worse on 
certain brain function tests.55 So not only may aspartame cause adverse mental effects 
in sensitive populations but it may also harm the general public at sufficient doses. 
Avoiding diet soda and those pastel paper packets seems easy enough, but 
artificial sweeteners are also present in more than six thousand products,56 including 
breath mints, cereals, chewing gums, jams and jellies, juice drinks, puddings, and 
even nutritional bars and yogurts.57 This prevalence has led researchers to assert that 
aspartame “is impossible to completely eradicate from daily encounters.”58 But, of 
course, that’s only true for people who eat processed foods. This is yet another 
reason to spend most of your time at the grocery store in the produce aisle. 
Discriminating shoppers make it a priority to read ingredients lists, but the healthiest 
foods in the supermarket don’t even have them. 
Exercise versus Antidepressants 
We’ve known for decades that even a single workout can elevate mood59 and that 
physical activity is associated with decreased symptoms of depression. One study of 
nearly five thousand people across the country, for example, found that people who 
exercised regularly had 25 percent lower odds of a major depression diagnosis.60 
Of course, studies like these may not mean that exercise reduces depression. 
Maybe it means that depression reduces exercise. In other words, if you’re 
depressed, you might feel too lousy to get out of bed and go for a walk. What was 
needed to test this idea was an interventional study, one in which depressed subjects 
were split at random (randomized) into two groups, one that exercised and one that 
didn’t. 
That’s what a team of researchers from Duke University attempted. They 
randomly assigned depressed men and women aged fifty or older to either begin an 
aerobic exercise program or take the antidepressant drug sertraline (Zoloft). Within 
four months, the mood of those in the drug group improved so much that they were, on 
average, no longer depressed. But the same powerful effect was found in the exercise 
group—that is, the group of people who weren’t taking any drugs. Exercise, it 
seemed, works about as well as medication.61 
Let’s play devil’s advocate for a moment: The drug-free group in the Duke study 
met three times each week for an exercise class. Could the social stimulation rather 
than the exercise have improved their mood? With this question in mind, the same 
researchers subsequently conducted the largest-ever exercise trial of patients with 
depression. This time, they added a group, so one group took antidepressants, one 
group took an exercise class, and a new group did exercises by themselves at home. 
The results? No matter the setting—whether subjects were alone or in a group— 
exercise appeared to work about as well as drugs at bringing depression into 
remission.62 
So before your doctor writes you a prescription for an antidepressant, ask about 
prescribing a daily workout instead. 
Antioxidants and Folate 
Accumulating evidence suggests that free radicals—those highly unstable molecules 
that cause tissue damage and contribute to aging—may play an important role in the 
development of various psychiatric disorders, including depression.63 Modern 
imaging techniques confirm autopsy studies showing a shrinkage of certain emotion 
centers in the brains of depressed patients that may be due to death of nerve cells in 
these areas caused by free radicals.64 
This phenomenon may help explain why those who eat more fruits and vegetables, 
which are rich in the antioxidants that extinguish free radicals, appear protected 
against depression. A study of nearly three hundred thousand Canadians found that 
greater fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower risk of 
depression, psychological distress, mood and anxiety disorders, and poor perceived 
mental health. The researchers concluded that eating antioxidant-rich plant foods 
“may dampen the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on mental health.”65 
The Canadian study relied on questionnaires asking people to self-report fruit and 
vegetable intake, a method that’s not always accurate. A nationwide American study 
took it one step further and measured the level of carotenoid phytonutrients in 
people’s bloodstreams. These phytonutrients include some of the yellow, orange, and 
red antioxidant pigments found naturally in some of our healthiest foods, including 
sweet potatoes and green leafy vegetables. Not only did people with higher levels of 
these nutrients in their bloodstreams have a lower risk of depression symptoms but 
there was also an apparent “dose-response relationship,” meaning that the higher the 
level of phytonutrients, the better people seemed to feel.66 
Among the carotenoids, lycopene (the red pigment in tomatoes) has the highest 
antioxidant activity. Indeed, a study of nearly one thousand elderly men and women 
found that people who ate tomatoes or tomato products daily had just half the odds of 
depression compared with those who ate them once a week or less.67 
If antioxidants are so helpful, why can’t we just pop a few antioxidant pills? 
Well, only food sources of antioxidants appear to be protectively associated with 
depression. The same can’t be said for dietary supplements.68 This finding may 
indicate that the form and delivery of the antioxidants we consume are crucial to 
ensure their best effects. Alternatively, antioxidants may just be a marker for other 
components of plant-rich diets, such as folate. 
Folate is a B vitamin concentrated in beans and greens. (Its name comes from the 
Latin word folium, meaning “leaf,” because it was first isolated in spinach.) Early 
studies linking depression to low folate levels in the blood were cross-sectional in 
nature, meaning they were only snapshots in time. For this reason, we didn’t know 
whether low folate intake led to depression or if depression itself led to low folate 
intake.69 However, more recent studies following people over time suggest that low 
dietary folate intake may indeed increase the risk of severe depression by as much as 
threefold.70 However, once again, folate supplements (folic acid) do not appear to 
help.71 
Vegetables—including antioxidant-rich tomatoes and folate-packed greens—may 
be good for the body and the mind. 
Do Antidepressant Drugs Really Work? 
We’ve seen that saffron and exercise compare favorably to drugs in treating 
depression, but how much is that really saying? Thousands of published studies seem 
to have demonstrated that antidepressant drugs are effective.72 The key word here, 
though, may be published. What if drug companies decided to publish only those 
studies that showed a positive effect but quietly shelved and concealed any studies 
showing the drugs didn’t work? To find out if this was the case, researchers applied 
to the Food and Drug Administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) to get access to the published and unpublished studies submitted by 
pharmaceutical companies. What they found was shocking. 
According to the published literature, the results of nearly all antidepressant trials 
were positive. In contrast, FDA analysis of trial data—including the unpublished 
studies—demonstrated that roughly half of the trials showed the drugs didn’t work 
after all. When all the data—published and unpublished—were combined, 
antidepressants failed to show a clinically significant advantage over placebo sugar 
pills.73 This finding suggests that the placebo effect explains the apparent clinical 
effectiveness of antidepressants. In other words, improvements in mood may be a 
result of the patient’s belief in the power of the drug—not the drug itself.74 
Even worse, the FOIA documents revealed that the FDA knew that these drugs— 
such as Paxil and Prozac—didn’t work much better than placebo yet made an explicit 
decision to shield drug companies by keeping this information from the public and 
prescribing physicians.75 How could drug companies get away with this? The 
pharmaceutical industry is considered one of the most profitable and politically 
powerful industries in the United States, and mental illness is considered a golden 
goose: chronic, common, and often treated with multiple drugs.76 Indeed, 
antidepressants are currently prescribed to more than 8 percent of the population.77 
Just because antidepressant drugs may not work better than fake pills doesn’t 
mean they don’t work at all. Antidepressants offer substantial benefits to millions of 
people suffering from depression. And although the placebo effect is real and 
powerful, antidepressants do seem to beat out sugar pills in reducing symptoms in the 
most severely depressed—perhaps about 10 percent of patients (although admittedly, 
this statistic also means that about 90 percent of depressed patients may be 
prescribed medication with negligible benefit).78 
If doctors are willing to give patients placebo-equivalent treatments, some argue 
that it would be better for them to just lie to patients and give them actual sugar 
pills.79 Unlike the drugs, sugar pills do not cause side effects. For example, 
antidepressants cause sexual dysfunction in up to three-quarters of users. Other 
problems may include long-term weight gain and insomnia. And about one in five 
people have withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit.80 
Perhaps most tragically, antidepressants may make people more likely to become 
depressed in the future. Studies show that patients are more likely to become 
depressed again after treatment with antidepressants than after treatment by other 
means, including placebos.81 So even if the mood-boosting benefit of exercise is also 
a placebo effect, at least it’s one with benefits rather than risks. 
Just reading the dry statistics in all the studies, it’s hard to appreciate the 
suffering. Seeing a graph in which depression scores drop for even hundreds of 
people doesn’t hit me on the same gut level as seeing a single e-mail in my inbox of 
someone sharing his or her story of physical and emotional renewal. 
Not long ago, a woman wrote to me about her battle with depression. Shay, in her 
forties, had always stuck to the standard American diet. In recent years, she had been 
suffering from severe migraines, unbearable constipation, and painful and irregular 
menstrual cycles. Meanwhile, her depression had become so bad that she was unable 
to go to work. Then Shay discovered my website and began educating herself about 
nutrition. Soon she came to understand how the Western diet was potentially 
contributing to her health problems, not to mention her unhappiness, and she became 
an ardent watcher of NutritionFacts.org videos. 
Shay decided to switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet. She stopped eating 
animal products and junk and vastly increased her intake of fruits and vegetables. 
After four weeks, she had more energy and less-painful bowel movements. Within 
seven months, her bowel movements were effortless, her once-crippling migraines 
had stopped altogether, her periods were more regular, less painful, and shorter— 
and her depression was gone. Just months earlier, Shay had felt so bad that she 
couldn’t get out of bed in the morning. But by improving her diet, she is now much 
healthier, both physically and mentally. 
That is a great example of the power of a healthy diet. 
 CHAPTER 13 
How Not to Die from Prostate Cancer 
When Tony, a regular reader of NutritionFacts.org, heard that I was writing this 
book, he asked me to share his story with you in the hopes of helping other men avoid 
what happened to him. A happily married father, engineer, and self-described fitness 
nut, he always tried to make good choices out of respect for his body and was lucky 
to have descended from long-lived, healthy ancestors. Tony was a runner who had 
always been at a healthy weight. He stayed away from tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. In 
the 1980s, based on health recommendations from the USDA, he convinced his 
family to switch from whole milk to skim milk and from beef to fish and chicken— 
lots and lots of chicken. 
Tony was the kind of patient doctors love to take care of—the type who says, 
“What else can I do to be at my very best?” So no one was more surprised than Tony 
when, in his early fifties, he was diagnosed with an aggressive prostate cancer. He 
sought care at a world-renowned medical center and underwent a radical 
prostatectomy, which successfully removed his cancer but left him with the daily 
challenge of dealing with the consequences of that surgery—namely, urinary leakage 
and erectile dysfunction. 
He says he wishes he’d known about the conflicts of interest within the USDA 
(which I elaborated in chapter 5) that have affected the federal agency’s ability to 
make recommendations in the best interests of the public independent of those of the 
food industry. 
Eventually, Tony discovered the body of research you will be reading about in 
this chapter, and, being a scientist, he immediately understood the evidence that a 
healthy diet can improve male health. He has eaten a plant-based diet for the last 
several years, takes flaxseed every day, and has had no recurrence of cancer. As I 
will discuss, the same diet that may prevent prostate cancer has also been shown to 
potentially slow it down and even reverse its progression among those already 
diagnosed. So it is Tony’s (and my) wish that this chapter will help you see the 
importance of healthy eating for a healthy prostate. 
The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located between the bladder and base of the 
penis, just in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra, the outlet from the bladder, 
and secretes the fluid portion of semen. Just as glandular tissue in the breast can 
become cancerous, so can glandular tissue in the prostate. 
Autopsy studies show that about half of men over the age of eighty have prostate 
cancer.1 Most men die with prostate cancer without ever knowing they had it. That’s 
the problem with the emphasis on screenings—many prostate cancers that are 
detected may never have led to harm even if they’d gone undiscovered.2 
Unfortunately, not all men are so lucky. Nearly twenty-eight thousand die each year 
from prostate cancer.3 
Milk and Prostate Cancer 
Since the U.S. National Dairy Board was first created by the Dairy and Tobacco 
Adjustment Act of 1983, it has spent more than $1 billion on advertising. By now, 
we’re all familiar with its various slogans, such as “Milk is a natural.” But is it? 
Think about it. Humans are the only species who drink milk after weaning. It also 
does seem a bit unnatural to drink the milk of another species. 
What about “Milk: It Does a Body Good”? All foods of animal origin contain sex 
steroid hormones, such as estrogen, but today’s genetically “improved” dairy cows 
are milked throughout their pregnancies when their reproductive hormones are 
particularly high.4 These hormones naturally found even in organic cow’s milk may 
play a role in the various associations identified between milk and other dairy 
products and hormone-related conditions, including acne,5 diminished male 
reproductive potential,6 and premature puberty.7 The hormone content in milk may 
explain why women who drink it appear to have five times the rate of twin births 
compared with women who do not drink milk.8 When it comes to cancer, though, the 
greater concern may have to do with growth hormones.9 
Mother Nature designed cow’s milk to put a few hundred pounds on a baby calf 
within a few months. A lifetime of human exposure to these growth factors in milk 
may help explain the connections found between dairy consumption and certain 
cancers.10 Leading Harvard University nutrition experts have expressed concern that 
the hormones in dairy products and other growth factors could stimulate the growth of 
hormone-sensitive tumors.11 Experimental evidence suggests that dairy could also 
promote the conversion of precancerous lesions or mutated cells into invasive 
cancers.12 
Concerns about milk and other dairy products first arose from population-scale 
data, such as the twenty-five-fold increase in prostate cancer in Japanese men since 
World War II, which coincided with a sevenfold increase in egg consumption, a 
ninefold increase in meat consumption, and a twentyfold increase in dairy 
consumption.13 Though the rest of their diets remained comparatively stable and 
similar trends have been noted in other countries,14 there were myriad changes in 
Japanese society beyond eating more animal products that could have contributed to 
these rising cancer rates. So scientists took a closer look. 
To control for as many variables as possible, researchers devised an experiment 
in which they dripped milk on human prostate cancer cells in a petri dish. The 
researchers chose organic cow’s milk to exclude any effect of added hormones, such 
as the bovine growth hormone, which is commonly injected into conventionally 
raised cows so they produce more milk.15 The researchers found that cow’s milk 
stimulated the growth of human prostate cancer cells in each of fourteen separate 
experiments, producing an average increase in cancer growth rate of more than 30 
percent. In contrast, almond milk suppressed the growth of the cancer cells by more 
than 30 percent.16 
What happens in a petri dish, though, doesn’t necessarily happen in people. 
Nevertheless, a compilation of case-control studies did conclude that cow’s milk 
consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer,17 and the same outcome was found 
for cohort studies.18 A 2015 meta-analysis found that high intakes of dairy products— 
milk, low-fat milk, and cheese, but not nondairy sources of calcium—appear to 
increase total prostate cancer risk.19 
But, you may be wondering, if you don’t drink milk, what will happen to your 
bones? Doesn’t milk help prevent osteoporosis? It turns out that the promised benefit 
may be just another empty marketing ploy. A meta-analysis of cow’s milk intake and 
hip fracture studies shows no significant protection.20 Even if you were to start 
drinking milk during adolescence in an attempt to bolster peak bone mass, it probably 
wouldn’t reduce your chances of fracture later in life.21 One recent set of studies 
involving one hundred thousand men and women followed for up to two decades 
even suggested milk may increase bone and hip fracture rates.22 
Some babies are born with a rare birth defect called galactosemia, in which they 
lack the enzymes needed to detoxify galactose, a type of sugar found in milk. This 
means they end up with elevated levels of galactose in their blood, which can cause 
bone loss.23 A group of Swedish researchers figured that even among normal people 
who can detoxify the stuff, it might not be good for their bones to be drinking all that 
galactose in milk every day.24 And galactose may not just hurt bones. Scientists 
actually use galactose to induce premature aging in lab animals. When researchers 
slip lab animals some galactose, the “life-shortened animals showed 
neurodegeneration, mental retardation and cognitive dysfunction … diminished 
immune responses and reduction of reproductive ability.”25 And it doesn’t take much, 
just the human equivalent of one to two glasses worth of milk a day.26 
However, since humans aren’t rodents, researchers investigated the connection 
between milk intake and mortality, as well as fracture risk in large populations of 
milk drinkers.27 In addition to significantly more bone and hip fractures, researchers 
found higher rates of premature death, more heart disease, and significantly more 
cancer for each daily glass of milk women drank. Three glasses a day was associated 
with nearly twice the risk of dying early.28 Men with higher milk consumption also 
had a higher rate of death, although they didn’t have higher fracture rates.29 
Overall, the study showed a dose-dependent higher rate of mortality (in both men 
and women) and fracture (in women), but the opposite was found for other dairy 
products, such as soured milk and yogurt, which would go along with the galactose 
theory, because the bacteria in these foods can ferment away some of the lactose.30 
The medical journal editorial accompanying the published study emphasized that, 
given the rise in milk consumption around the world, the “role of milk in mortality 
needs to be established definitively now.”31 
Eggs, Choline, and Cancer 
More than two million men are currently living with prostate cancer, but living with 
prostate cancer is better than dying from it. If the cancer is caught while still 
localized within the prostate, the chances of it killing you within the next five years 
are practically nil. However, if the cancer spreads far enough, your chances of 
surviving five years may be as low as one in three.32 For this reason, scientists have 
been desperate to identify factors involved in the spread of prostate cancer once it 
has emerged. 
Hoping to identify possible culprits, Harvard University researchers recruited 
more than one thousand men with early-stage prostate cancer and followed them for 
several years. Compared with men who rarely ate eggs, men who ate even less than a 
single egg a day appeared to have twice the risk of prostate cancer progression, such 
as metastasizing into the bones. The only thing potentially worse for prostate cancer 
than eggs was poultry: Men with more aggressive cancer who regularly ate chicken 
and turkey had up to four times the risk of prostate cancer progression.33 
The researchers suggested that the link between consuming poultry and advancing 
cancer may be due to cooked-meat carcinogens (such as heterocyclic amines as 
discussed in chapter 11). For unknown reasons, these carcinogens build up more in 
the muscles of chickens and turkeys than in those of other animals.34 
But what cancer-promoting substance is there in eggs? How could eating less than 
an egg a day double the risk of cancer invasion? The answer may be choline, a 
compound found concentrated in eggs.35 
Higher levels of choline in the blood have been associated with increased risk of 
developing prostate cancer in the first place.36 This may explain the link between 
eggs and cancer progression.37 But what about cancer mortality? In a paper entitled 
“Choline Intake and Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer,” the same Harvard team found 
that men who consumed the most choline from food also had an increased risk of 
cancer death.38 Men who consume two and a half or more eggs per week—basically 
an egg every three days—may have an 81 percent increased risk of dying from 
prostate cancer.39 The choline in eggs, like the carnitine in red meat, is converted into 
a toxin called trimethylamine40 by bacteria that exist in the guts of those who eat 
meat.41 And trimethylamine, once oxidized in the liver, appears to increase the risk of 
heart attack, stroke, and premature death.42 
Ironically, the presence of choline in eggs is something the egg industry boasts 
about even though most Americans get more than enough choline.43 Mind you, the 
industry executives are aware of the cancer connection. Through the Freedom of 
Information Act, I was able to get my hands on an e-mail from the executive director 
of the Egg Nutrition Board directed to another egg industry executive that discussed 
the Harvard study suggesting that choline is a culprit in promoting cancer 
progression. “Certainly worth keeping in mind,” he wrote, “as we continue to 
promote choline as another good reason to consume eggs.”44 
Diet Versus Exercise 
Nathan Pritikin, the man who helped launch a lifestyle medicine revolution—and 
saved my grandma’s life—wasn’t a nutritionist or a dietitian. He wasn’t even a 
doctor. He was an engineer. When he was diagnosed with heart disease in his forties, 
Pritikin reviewed all the available research himself and decided to try eating the type 
of diet followed by populations in places like rural Africa, where heart disease was 
rare. He figured that if he stopped eating a heart-disease-promoting diet, he could 
stop the advancement of the disease. What he found was even more remarkable. He 
didn’t just stop the disease from getting worse, he reversed his condition.45 He then 
went on to help thousands of others do the same. 
After vanquishing our number-one killer, heart disease, Dr. Dean Ornish and 
Pritikin Research Foundation researchers moved on to killer number two: cancer. 
They developed an elegant series of experiments, placing people on different diets 
and then dripping their blood on human cancer cells growing in a petri dish. Whose 
bloodstream would be better at suppressing cancer growth? 
The research showed that the blood of people randomized to a plant-based-diet 
group was dramatically less hospitable to cancer-cell growth than the blood of 
people in the control group who continued to eat their typical diet. The blood of those 
eating the standard American diet does fight cancer—if it didn’t, many of us would 
be dead!—but the blood of people eating plant-based diets was shown to fight cancer 
about eight times better.46 
The blood of men on the standard American diet slowed down the rate of prostate 
cancer cell growth by 9 percent. Place men on a plant-based diet for a year, though, 
and the blood circulating within their bodies can suppress cancer cell growth by 70 
percent—that’s nearly eight times the stopping power compared to a meat-centered 
menu.47 Similar studies have shown that women eating plant-based diets appear to 
strengthen their bodies’ defenses against breast cancer in just fourteen days (as 
detailed in chapter 11).48 It’s as if we’re a totally different person inside after eating 
and living healthfully for just a couple of weeks. 
It should be noted that the strengthening of cancer defenses in all these studies 
involved eating a plant-based diet and exercising. For example, in the breast cancer 
study, the women were asked to walk thirty to sixty minutes a day. How, then, do we 
know it was the diet that made their blood more effective at suppressing cancer 
growth? To tease out the effects of diet and exercise, a UCLA research team 
compared three groups of men: a plant-based diet-and-exercise group, an exercise- 
only group, and a control group of sedentary people eating standard fare.49 
The diet-and-exercise group had been following a plant-based diet for fourteen 
years, along with participating in moderate exercise, such as a daily walk. The 
exercise-only group eating the standard American diet, on the other hand, had spent 
about fifteen years exercising strenuously for an hour a day at the gym at least five 
times a week. The researchers wanted to know if people who exercise hard enough 
for long enough develop cancer-fighting abilities that rival that of strolling plant 
eaters.50 
To find out, blood from each of the three groups was dripped onto human prostate 
cancer cells growing in a petri dish to see whose blood kicked more cancer butt. The 
blood of the control group wasn’t completely defenseless. Even if you’re a french 
fry–eating couch potato, your blood may still be able to kill off 1–2 percent of cancer 
cells. But the blood of those who exercised strenuously every weekday for fifteen 
years killed 2,000 percent more cancer cells than the control groups’. Fantastic 
results, but the blood of those in the plant-based diet-and-exercise group wiped out 
an astounding 4,000 percent more cancer cells than that of the first group. Clearly 
exercise alone had a dramatic effect, but at the end of the day, thousands of hours in 
the gym appeared to be no match for a plant-based diet.51 
Prostate Cancer Reversal Through Diet? 
If a healthy diet can turn your bloodstream into a cancer-fighting machine, what about 
using it not just to prevent cancer but also to treat it? Other leading killers, including 
heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, can be prevented, arrested, and even 
reversed, so why not cancer? 
To test this question, Dr. Ornish and his colleagues recruited ninety-three men 
with prostate cancer who had chosen not to undergo any conventional treatment. 
Prostate cancer can be so slow growing and the side effects of treatment so onerous 
that men diagnosed with it often choose to be placed in a medical holding pattern 
called “watchful waiting” or “expectant management.” Because the next step is often 
chemotherapy, radiation, and/or radical surgery that may leave men incontinent and 
impotent, doctors try to delay treatment as long as possible. And since these patients 
aren’t actively doing anything to treat the disease, they represent an ideal population 
in whom to investigate the power of diet and lifestyle interventions. 
The prostate cancer patients were randomized into two groups: a control group 
that wasn’t given any diet or lifestyle advice beyond whatever their personal doctors 
told them to do, and a healthy-living group prescribed a strict plant-based diet 
centered around fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, along with other healthy 
lifestyle changes, such as walking for thirty minutes, six days a week.52 
Cancer progression was tracked using PSA levels, a marker of prostate cancer 
growth inside the body. After a year, the control group’s PSA levels increased by 6 
percent. That’s what cancer tends to do: grow over time. But among the healthy- 
living group, PSA levels decreased by 4 percent, suggesting an average shrinkage of 
their tumors.53 No surgery, no chemotherapy, no radiation—just eating and living 
healthfully. 
Biopsies taken before and after the diet and lifestyle intervention showed that the 
expression of more than five hundred genes was affected. This was one of the first 
demonstrations that changing what you eat and how you live can affect you at a 
genetic level, in terms of which genes are switched on and off.54 Within a year after 
the study ended, the cancers in the patients in the control group grew so much that 10 
percent of them were forced to undergo a radical prostatectomy,55 a surgery that 
involves the removal of the entire prostate gland and surrounding tissues. This 
treatment can lead not only to urinary incontinence (urine leakage) and impotence but 
to alterations in orgasmic function in approximately 80 percent of men undergoing the 
procedure.56 In contrast, none in the plant-based diet and lifestyle group ended up on 
the operating table. 
How were the researchers able to convince a group of older men to basically eat 
a vegan diet for a year? They evidently delivered prepared meals to their homes.57 I 
guess the researchers figured men are so lazy they’ll just eat whatever is put in front 
of them—and it worked! 
Now, how about in the real world? Realizing that doctors apparently can’t get 
most men with cancer to eat even a measly five servings of fruits and veggies daily,58 
a group of researchers at the University of Massachusetts settled on just trying to 
change their A:V ratio, or the ratio of animal to vegetable proteins in their diets.59 
Maybe just a reduction in meat and dairy and an increase in plant foods would be 
enough to put cancer into remission? 
To test this, the researchers randomized prostate cancer patients into two groups, 
one group that attended classes on eating a more plant-based diet and a conventional- 
care group that received no dietary instruction. The healthy-eating advice group was 
able to drop their A:V ratio down to about 1:1, getting half their protein from plant 
sources. In contrast, the control group’s ratio stayed up around 3:1 animal-to-plant 
protein.60 
Those on the half-vegan diet did appear to slow down the growth of their cancer. 
Their average PSA doubling time—an estimate of how fast their tumors may have 
been doubling in size—slowed from twenty-one months to fifty-eight months.61 In 
other words, the cancer kept growing, but even a part-time plant-based diet appeared 
to be able to significantly slow down their tumors’ expansion. It is worth noting, 
though, that Dr. Ornish and colleagues were able to demonstrate that a full-time 
plant-based diet allowed for an apparent reversal in cancer growth: The subjects’ 
PSA levels didn’t just rise more slowly, but they trended downward. Thus, the ideal 
animal-to-plant protein ratio may be closer to zero to one. 
The Worst A and the Best V 
What if there’s just no way Grandpa’s going vegan, leaving you with only half 
measures? What would be on the short list of foods for him to avoid, or to include, in 
his diet? 
Based on the Harvard University prostate cancer progression and mortality data 
detailed above, eggs and poultry may be the worst offenders: Patients may face twice 
the cancer progression risk from eating less than a single egg per day and up to 
quadruple the risk from eating less than a single serving of chicken or turkey daily.62 
On the other hand, if you were to add only one thing to your diet, consider 
cruciferous vegetables. Less than a single serving a day of broccoli, brussels sprouts, 
cabbage, cauliflower, or kale may cut the risk of cancer progression by more than 
half.63 
Watching your animal-to-plant protein ratio might be useful for cancer prevention 
in general. For example, the largest study ever performed on diet and bladder cancer 
—comprising nearly five hundred thousand people—found that an increase in animal 
protein consumption of just 3 percent was associated with a 15 percent increased 
risk of bladder cancer. On the other hand, an increase in plant protein intake of only 2 
percent was associated with a 23 percent decreased cancer risk.64 
Flaxseed 
Prostate cancer rates vary tremendously around the world. African Americans, for 
example, may have an incidence of clinically apparent prostate cancer that is some 
30 times greater than that of Japanese men and 120 times greater than that of Chinese 
men. This discrepancy has been attributed in part to the higher amounts of animal 
protein and fat in Western diets.65 Another factor, though, may be the soy common in 
many Asian diets, which contains protective phytoestrogens called isoflavones.66 
As detailed in chapter 11, the other major class of phytoestrogens is lignans, 
found throughout the plant kingdom but especially concentrated in flaxseeds. Higher 
levels of lignans tend to be found in the prostate fluids of populations of men with 
relatively low rates of prostate cancer,67 and lignans have also been shown to slow 
the growth of prostate cancer cells in a petri dish.68 
Researchers decided to put lignans to the test by asking men with prostate cancer 
scheduled for prostate-removal surgery the following month to consume three 
tablespoons a day of flaxseed. After surgery, their tumors were examined. Within just 
those few weeks, the flaxseed consumption appeared to have lowered their cancer- 
cell proliferation rates, while at the same time increasing their rate of cancer-cell 
clearance.69 
Even better, flaxseeds may also be able to prevent prostate cancer from advancing 
to that stage in the first place. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a 
precancerous prostate lesion found during a biopsy; it is analogous to ductal 
carcinoma in situ of the breast. Those with PIN have a high risk for cancer to appear 
during subsequent biopsies—25–79 percent.70 Because men are repeatedly biopsied 
to monitor their condition, the procedures provide a perfect opportunity to see if a 
dietary intervention can keep these lesions from progressing to cancer. 
After the first biopsies of their prostates came back PIN positive, fifteen men 
were asked to eat three tablespoons of flaxseed a day for the six months until their 
next biopsy. After that time, they showed a significant drop in PSA levels and biopsy 
cell-proliferation rates, suggesting that flaxseeds may indeed thwart the progression 
of prostate cancer. Two of the men saw their PSA levels drop to normal and didn’t 
even need a second biopsy.71 
Bottom line: The evidence suggests that flaxseed is a safe, low-cost source of 
nutrition and may reduce tumor-proliferation rates.72 Why not give it a try? Just make 
sure to grind the flaxseeds first if you don’t buy them preground—otherwise, the 
seeds may pass right through your body undigested. 
Enlarged Prostate 
If a healthy diet can slow down the abnormal growth of prostate cancer cells, can it 
also slow down the abnormal growth of normal prostate cells? Benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition characterized by enlargement of the prostate gland. 
In the United States, BPH affects millions of men73—as many as half of men by their 
fifties and 80 percent of men by their eighties.74 Because the male prostate surrounds 
the outlet from the bladder, it can obstruct the normal flow of urine if it grows too 
large. This obstruction can cause a weak or hesitant stream and inadequate emptying 
of the bladder, requiring frequent trips to the bathroom. The stagnant urine retained in 
the bladder can also become a breeding ground for infection. 
Unfortunately, the problem only seems to get worse as the gland continues to 
grow. Billions of dollars have been spent on drugs and supplements, and millions of 
American men have undergone surgery for BPH.75 Surgical procedures involve a 
variety of Roto-Rooter techniques with innocent-sounding acronyms, such as TUMT, 
TUNA, and TURP. The Ts stand for transurethral—meaning going up the penis with 
an instrument called a resectoscope. TUMT stands for transurethral microwave 
thermotherapy, in which doctors basically tunnel up the penis using an antenna-like 
tool and burn out a shaft with microwaves.76 TUNA stands for transurethral needle 
ablation; here, a column is burned out with a pair of heated needles. And these are 
so-called minimally invasive techniques!77 The gold standard procedure is the 
TURP, wherein surgeons essentially use a loop of wire to core out the prostate. Side 
effects include “postoperative discomfort.”78 Ya think?! 
There has to be a better way. 
BPH is so common that most doctors may assume that it’s just an inevitable 
consequence of aging. But it wasn’t always so. In China in the 1920s and 1930s, for 
example, a medical college in Beijing reported that BPH affected not 80 percent of 
male patients but about eighty cases total over fifteen years. Both the historic rarity 
of BPH and prostate cancer in Japan and China have been attributed to the countries’ 
traditional plant-based diets.79 
This idea was studied by the same Pritikin Foundation researchers who pitted the 
blood of individuals before and after a plant-based diet against the growth of prostate 
cancer cells. This time, they performed the same experiment on the type of normal 
prostate cells that grow to obstruct urine flow. Within just two weeks, those eating 
plant-based diets saw their blood acquire the ability to suppress the abnormal growth 
of noncancerous prostate cells too—and the effect didn’t seem to dissipate with time. 
The blood of those eating plant-based diets over the long term had the same 
beneficial effect for up to twenty-eight years straight. So it appears that as long as we 
continue to eat healthfully, prostate cell-growth rates will continue to go down and 
stay down.80 
Some plants may be particularly prostate friendly. Research has found that 
flaxseeds can be used to treat BPH. Men given the equivalent of about three 
tablespoons of flaxseeds a day experienced relief comparable to that provided by 
commonly prescribed such drugs as Flomax or Proscar81—without the drugs’ side 
effects, such as lightheadedness or sexual dysfunction. 
Is it possible to prevent BPH in the first place? Eating garlic and onions has been 
associated with significantly lower risk of BPH.82 In general, cooked vegetables may 
work better than raw ones, and legumes—beans, chickpeas, split peas, and lentils— 
have also been associated with lower risk.83 TVP, short for textured vegetable 
protein, is a soybean product often used in pasta sauces and veggie chili. I would 
recommend that type of TVP over the one used in urology, which stands for 
transurethral vaporization of the prostate.84 
IGF-1 
Why do people who live to be one hundred or older seem to escape cancer? As you 
age, your risk of developing and dying from cancer grows every year—until you hit 
eighty-five or ninety, when, interestingly, your cancer risk begins to drop.85 Indeed, if 
you don’t get cancer by a certain age, you may never get it. What accounts for this 
relative resistance to cancer among centenarians? It may have to do with a cancer- 
promoting growth hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).86 
Each year, you are reborn. You create and destroy nearly your entire body weight 
in new cells every year. Every day, about fifty billion of your cells die, and about 
fifty billion new cells are born to keep you in balance.87 Of course, sometimes you 
need to grow, as when you’re a baby or during puberty. Your cells don’t become 
larger when you grow up; they simply become more numerous. An adult may have 
around forty trillion cells in his or her body, four times more than a child. 
Once you’ve gotten through puberty, you no longer need to produce many more 
cells than you retire. You still need your cells to grow and divide, of course—out 
with the old, in with the new. You just don’t want to make more cells than you’re 
putting out to pasture. In adults, extra cell growth can mean the development of 
tumors. 
How does your body keep itself in balance? By sending chemical signals called 
hormones to all the cells. A key signal is a growth hormone called IGF-1. It sounds 
like a droid from Star Wars , but IGF-1 is actually a crucial factor in regulating cell 
growth. Levels go up when you’re a kid in order to power your development, but 
when you reach adulthood, IGF-1 levels diminish. It’s your body’s cue to stop 
producing more cells than it kills off. 
Should your levels of IGF-1 remain too high when you reach adulthood, however, 
your cells will constantly receive a message to grow, divide, and keep going and 
growing. Not surprisingly, the more IGF-1 you have in your bloodstream, the higher 
your risk for developing cancers, such as prostate cancer.88 
There is a rare form of dwarfism called Laron syndrome that is caused by the 
body’s inability to produce IGF-1. Affected individuals grow to be only a few feet 
tall, but they also almost never get cancer.89 Laron syndrome is a sort of cancer- 
proofing mutation, which led scientists to wonder: What if you could get all the IGF- 
1 you needed as a child to grow to a normal height but then down-regulate this 
hormone as adults and thereby turn off excess growth signals? It turns out you can do 
just that—not with surgery or medication but through simple dietary choices. 
The release of IGF-1 appears to be triggered by the consumption of animal 
protein.90 This may explain why you can so dramatically bolster the cancer-fighting 
power of your bloodstream within weeks of eating a plant-based diet. Remember the 
experiments in which dripping the blood from people eating healthy diets onto cancer 
cells wiped more of them out? Well, if you add back to the cancer cells the amount of 
IGF-1 that left the plant eaters’ systems, guess what happens? The diet-and-exercise 
effect disappears. The cancer cell growth comes surging back. This is how we 
suspect plant-based eating boosts our blood defenses: By reducing animal protein 
intake, we reduce our levels of IGF-1.91 
After just eleven days of cutting back on animal protein, your IGF-1 levels can 
drop by 20 percent, and your levels of IGF-1 binding protein can jump by 50 
percent.92 One of the ways your body tries to protect itself from cancer—that is, 
excessive growth—is by releasing a binding protein into your bloodstream to tie up 
any excess IGF-1. Think of it as the body’s emergency brake. Even if you’ve 
managed to down-regulate production of new IGF-1 through diet, what about all that 
excess IGF-1 still circulating from the bacon and eggs you may have eaten two weeks 
before? No problem: The liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to help 
take it out of circulation. 
How plant focused does a diet have to be to lower IGF-1 levels? Animal protein 
stimulates IGF-1 production whether it’s the muscle proteins in meat, the egg-white 
protein in eggs, or the milk proteins in dairy. Vegetarians who include eggs and dairy 
in their diets don’t seem to achieve a significant reduction in IGF-1. Only men93 and 
women94 who limit their intake of all animal proteins appear able to significantly 
drop their levels of the cancer-promoting hormone and raise their levels of the 
protective binding proteins. 
*   *   * 
Prostate cancer isn’t inevitable. I once gave a speech in Bellport, New York, about 
preventing chronic disease through diet. Afterward, an audience member named John 
was inspired to e-mail me and recount his battle with prostate cancer. Diagnosed at 
age fifty-two, John had had six needle core biopsies performed, and each showed his 
cancer to be very aggressive. John’s doctors immediately recommended surgery to 
remove his entire prostate. 
Instead of going under the knife, John decided to switch to a plant-based diet. 
Eight months later, he had another biopsy. His doctors were astonished to see that 
only 10 percent of his cancer remained. What’s more, his PSA tests have been 
completely normal ever since. 
John was diagnosed in 1996. After changing his diet, his cancer went away and 
has stayed away. 
John may have just gotten lucky, though. I do not recommend that people ignore 
their doctors’ advice. Whatever you and your medical team decide together, healthy 
diet and lifestyle changes can presumably only help. That’s the nice thing about 
lifestyle interventions—they can be implemented in addition to whatever other 
treatment options are chosen. In a research setting, that can complicate matters, as 
you don’t know which action may be responsible for any improvement. But when 
facing a cancer diagnosis, you may want to opt for all the help you can get. 
Regardless of whether cancer patients elect for chemo, surgery, or radiation, they can 
always improve their diets. A prostate-healthy diet is a breast-healthy diet is a heart- 
healthy diet is a body-healthy diet. 
 CHAPTER 14 
How Not to Die from Parkinson’s Disease 
Back in the 1960s at the height of the civil rights movement, my dad was dodging 
bullets during the Brooklyn riots and setting up shots at just the right angle to best 
capture images of my mother being arrested at protests and dragged away again and 
again. His most famous work—one of Esquire’s 1963 Photos of the Year—depicted 
family friend Mineral Bramletter suspended in a Christlike pose between two white 
police officers as another cop clutched his throat. 
What a cruel twist of fate that a celebrated photojournalist got a disease that 
caused his hands to shake. For years, my dad suffered at the hands of Parkinson’s. 
Slowly and all too painfully, he lost the ability to take care of himself, to live his life 
in any semblance of the way he had before. He became bedridden and compromised 
in every way imaginable. 
After sixteen years of fighting, he went to the hospital one last time. As so often 
happens with chronic disease, one complication led to another. He got pneumonia 
and spent his last few weeks on a ventilator, suffering through a painful, prolonged 
death. The weeks he spent in that hospital bed before he passed were the worst 
weeks of both his and my life. 
Hospitals are terrible places to be and terrible places to die. That is why each of 
us needs to take care of ourselves. 
As my father’s story shows, Parkinson’s can end badly. It is the second most 
common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. Parkinson’s is a disabling 
disorder affecting the speed, quality, and ease of movement. Its hallmark symptoms, 
which worsen as the disease progresses, include hand tremors, limb stiffness, 
impaired balance, and difficulty walking. It can also affect mood, thinking, and sleep. 
Parkinson’s is not currently curable. 
The disease is caused by the die-off of specialized nerve cells in a region of the 
brain that controls movement. It typically presents after age fifty. A history of head 
trauma can increase risk,1 which may be why heavyweight boxers, including 
Muhammad Ali, and NFL players, including Hall of Famer Forrest Gregg, have 
fallen victim to the condition. However, most people may be more likely to develop 
the disease from toxic pollutants in our environment that can build up in the food 
supply and eventually affect the brain. 
The National Cancer Institute’s 2008/2009 U.S. Presidential Cancer Panel report 
discussed the degree to which we’re being inundated with industrial chemicals. It 
concluded: 
The American people—even before they are born—are bombarded 
continually with myriad combinations of these dangerous exposures. The 
Panel urges you [Mr. President] most strongly to use the power of your 
office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins from our food, water, and 
air that needlessly increase health care costs, cripple our Nation’s 
productivity, and devastate American lives.2 
In addition to increasing your risk of developing many cancers, industrial 
pollutants may also play a role in the onset of such brain-deteriorating 
(neurodegenerative) diseases as Parkinson’s.3 And those toxins are residing in most 
peoples’ bodies. 
Every few years, the CDC measures the levels of chemical pollutants in the 
bodies of thousands of Americans from across the country. According to the agency’s 
findings, the bodies of most women in the United States are contaminated with heavy 
metals, along with a number of toxic solvents, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, fire 
retardants, chemicals from plastics, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and banned 
pesticides such as DDT4 (publicized by American biologist Rachel Carson in her 
1962 bestseller Silent Spring). 
In many cases, 99–100 percent of the hundreds of women tested were found to 
have detectable levels of these pollutants circulating in their bloodstreams. Pregnant 
women were found to harbor, on average, up to fifty different chemicals.5 Could the 
presence of these potential toxicants in their bodies mean that they’re also being 
passed on to their children? Researchers decided to put that question to the test by 
measuring pollutant levels right at delivery in the babies’ umbilical cord blood. (As 
soon as the cord is cut, a little blood can be squirted into a vial.) After studying more 
than three hundred women who had recently given birth, researchers found that 95 
percent of umbilical cord samples showed detectable DDT residues.6 And this is 
now decades after the pesticide was banned. 
What about men? Men tend to have even higher levels of certain pollutants than 
women. A clue to solving this mystery was found when breast-feeding history was 
taken into account. Women who never breast-fed had about the same level of certain 
toxicants in their bodies as men, but the longer they breast-fed their children, the 
lower their levels fell, suggesting that they were detoxing themselves by passing the 
pollution down to their children.7 
It appears that blood levels of some pollutants in women may drop by nearly half 
during pregnancy,8 in part because their bodies pass them off through the placenta.9 
That may be why breast milk concentrations of pollutants appear higher after the first 
pregnancy than in subsequent ones.10 This could explain why birth order was found to 
be a significant predictor of pollutant levels in young people. Basically, firstborn 
kids may get first dibs on mom’s store of toxic waste, leaving less for their baby 
brothers and sisters.11 
Even mothers who were breast-fed as infants themselves tend to have higher 
levels of pollutants in their own breast milk when they grow up, suggesting a 
multigenerational passing down of these chemicals.12 In other words, what you eat 
now may affect the levels of toxic chemicals in your grandchildren. When it comes to 
feeding babies, breast is still best—absolutely13—but rather than detoxing into our 
children, we should strive not to “tox” ourselves in the first place. 
In 2012, researchers from the University of California–Davis, published an 
analysis of the diets of California kids aged two to seven. (Children are thought to be 
especially vulnerable to chemicals in the diet because they are still growing, and thus 
they have a comparatively greater intake of food and fluids relative to their weight.) 
Chemicals and heavy metals in children’s bodies from the foods they ate were indeed 
found to exceed safety levels by a larger margin than in adults. Cancer risk ratios, for 
instance, were exceeded by a factor of up to one hundred or more. For every child 
studied, benchmark levels were surpassed for arsenic, the banned pesticide dieldrin, 
and potentially highly toxic industrial by-products called dioxins. They were also too 
high for DDE, a by-product of DDT.14 
Which foods contributed the most heavy metals? The number-one food source of 
arsenic was poultry among preschoolers and, for their parents, tuna.15 The top source 
for lead? Dairy. For mercury? Seafood.16 
Those concerned about exposing their children to mercury-containing vaccines 
should know that eating just a single serving of fish each week during pregnancy can 
lead to more mercury in their infant’s body than injecting them directly with about a 
dozen mercury-containing vaccines.17 You should strive to minimize mercury 
exposure, but the benefits of vaccination far exceed the risks. The same cannot be 
said for tuna.18 
Where in the food supply are these pollutants found? Today, most DDT comes 
from meat, particularly fish.19 The oceans are essentially humanity’s sewer; 
everything eventually flows into the sea. The same is true when it comes to dietary 
exposure to PCBs—another set of banned chemicals, once widely used as insulating 
fluid in electrical equipment. A study of more than twelve thousand food and feed 
samples across eighteen countries found that the highest PCB contamination was 
found in fish and fish oil, followed by eggs, dairy, and then other meats. The lowest 
contamination was found at the bottom of the food chain, in plants.20 
Hexachlorobenzene, another pesticide banned nearly a half century ago, today 
may be found mainly in dairy and meat, including fish.21 Perfluorochemicals, or 
PFCs? Overwhelmingly found in fish and other meats.22 As for dioxins, in the United 
States, the most concentrated sources may be butter, followed by eggs, and then 
processed meat.23 The levels in eggs may help explain why one study found that 
eating more than half an egg a day was associated with about two to three times 
higher odds for cancers of the mouth, colon, bladder, prostate, and breast compared 
to those who didn’t eat eggs at all.24 
If women want to clean up their diets before conception, how long does it take for 
these pollutants to leave their systems? To find out, researchers asked people to eat 
one large serving a week of tuna or other high-mercury fish for fourteen weeks to 
boost their levels of the heavy metal and then stop. By measuring how fast the 
subjects’ mercury levels dropped, the scientists were able to calculate the half-life of 
mercury in the body.25 The subjects appeared to be able to clear about half the 
mercury from their bodies within two months. This result suggests that within a year 
of stopping fish consumption, the body can detox nearly 99 percent of it. 
Unfortunately, other industrial pollutants in fish can take longer for our bodies to get 
rid of; the half-lives for certain dioxins, PCBs, and DDT by-products found in fish 
are as long as ten years.26 So to get that same 99 percent drop, it could take more than 
a century—a long time to delay having your first child. 
By now you are probably wondering how these chemicals get into your food in 
the first place. One reason is that we’ve so thoroughly polluted our planet that the 
chemicals can just come down in the rain. For example, scientists have reported eight 
different pesticides contaminating the snow-packed peaks of Rocky Mountain 
National Park in Colorado.27 Once pollutants get into the soil, they can work their 
way up the food chain at increasing concentrations. Consider that before she’s 
slaughtered for meat, a dairy cow may eat seventy-five thousand pounds’ worth of 
plants. The chemicals in the plants can get stored in her fat and build up in her body. 
So when it comes to many of the fat-soluble pesticides and pollutants, every time you 
eat a burger, you are, in effect, eating everything that burger ate. The best way to 
minimize your exposure to industrial toxins may be to eat as low as possible on the 
food chain, a plant-based diet. 
Reducing Dioxin Intake 
Dioxins are highly toxic pollutants that accumulate in the fat of animal tissue, such 
that about 95 percent of human exposure comes from eating animal products.28 
Sometimes that’s because of contaminated animal feed. In the 1990s, for example, a 
supermarket survey found that the highest concentration of dioxins was found in farm- 
raised catfish.29 Apparently, the catfish were provided feed mixed with an anticaking 
agent laced with dioxins that may have originated from sewage sludge.30 
That same feed was given to chickens, affecting approximately 5 percent of U.S. 
poultry production at the time.31 That would mean that people ate hundreds of 
millions of contaminated chickens.32 Of course, if it was in the chickens, then it was 
also in their eggs. Indeed, elevated dioxins levels were found in U.S. eggs too.33 The 
U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that less than 1 percent of feed was 
contaminated, but 1 percent of egg production would mean more than a million 
tainted eggs per day. But the catfish contamination was even more widespread: More 
than one-third of all U.S. farm-raised catfish tested were found to be contaminated 
with dioxins.34 
In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration called on feed manufacturers to stop 
using these dioxin-tainted ingredients, stating that “[c]ontinued exposure to elevated 
dioxin levels in animal feed increases the risk of adverse health effects in animals 
and to humans consuming animal-derived food products.”35 So did the feed industry 
clean up their act? Up to a half billion pounds of catfish continued to be churned out 
of U.S. fish farms every year,36 but it wasn’t until more than a decade later that our 
government went back and checked for compliance. Researchers from the USDA 
tested samples of catfish from all over the country and in 2013 reported that 96 
percent of tested samples still contained dioxins or dioxin-like compounds. And 
when they checked the feed used to raise these fish? More than half the samples came 
back as contaminated.37 
In other words, the feed industry has known for more than two decades that what 
they were feeding to animals (and, ultimately, to most of us38) may contain dioxins, 
but apparently, they continue this practice unabated. 
The Institute of Medicine has made suggestions for reducing dioxin exposure, such 
as trimming fat from meat, including from poultry and fish, and avoiding the recycling 
of animal fat into gravy.39 Wouldn’t it be more prudent just to trim the amount of 
animal foods from your diet instead? Researchers have estimated that a plant-based 
diet could wipe out about 98 percent of your dioxin intake.40 
Smoking and Parkinson’s Disease 
The CDC recently celebrated the fifty-year anniversary of the landmark 1964 surgeon 
general’s report on smoking, considered one of the great public health achievements 
of our time.41 It’s interesting to go back and read the reactions of the tobacco industry 
to such reports. For example, an industry insider argued that contrary to the surgeon 
general’s argument that smoking costs our nation billions, “smoking saves the country 
money by increasing the number of people dying soon after retirement.”42 In other 
words, just think how much we’re saving on Medicare and Social Security thanks to 
cigarettes. 
The tobacco industry also criticized the surgeon general’s “lack of balance 
regarding benefits of smoking.”43 As they testified before Congress, these “positive 
health benefits” include “the feeling of well-being, satisfaction, and happiness and 
everything else.” Beyond all that happiness the surgeon general was trying to 
extinguish, the Tobacco Institute argued, “everything else” included protection 
against Parkinson’s disease.44 
As it happens, quite unexpectedly, more than five dozen studies over the past half 
century have collectively shown that smoking tobacco is indeed associated with 
significantly lower incidence of Parkinson’s disease.45 Valiant attempts have failed 
to explain away these findings. Maybe, public health scientists countered, it’s 
because smokers are dying off before they get Parkinson’s. No, smoking appears 
protective at all ages.46 Maybe it’s because smokers drink more coffee, which we 
know to be protective.47 No, the protective effect remained even after researchers 
controlled studies for coffee intake.48 Identical-twin studies helped rule out genetic 
factors in the link.49 Even simply growing up in a home where your parents smoked 
appears protective when it comes to developing Parkinson’s.50 So was the tobacco 
industry right? Does it even matter? 
Since the surgeon general’s groundbreaking 1964 report, more than twenty million 
Americans have died as a result of smoking.51 Even if you didn’t care about dying 
from lung cancer or emphysema, even if you cared only about protecting your brain, 
you still shouldn’t smoke, because smoking is a significant risk factor for stroke.52 
But what if you could get the benefits of smoking without the risks? 
Maybe you can. The neuroprotective agent in tobacco appears to be nicotine.53 
Tobacco is part of the nightshade family, the group of plants that includes tomatoes, 
potatoes, eggplants, and peppers. It turns out they all contain nicotine, too, but in such 
trace amounts—hundreds of times less than what’s found in a single cigarette—that 
the protective potential of vegetables was dismissed as inconsequential.54 But then it 
was discovered that just one to two puffs of a cigarette can saturate half of your 
brain’s nicotine receptors.55 Then we learned that even exposure to secondhand 
smoke may lower the risk of Parkinson’s56 and that the amount of nicotine exposure 
sitting in a smoky restaurant is on the same order as what you might get from eating a 
healthy meal in a smoke-free restaurant.57 So might eating lots of nightshade 
vegetables protect you from Parkinson’s after all? 
Researchers at the University of Washington decided to find out. When they tested 
for nicotine, they found none in eggplants, just a little in potatoes, some in tomatoes, 
and more significant amounts in bell peppers. These results were consistent with 
what researchers found when they studied nearly five hundred newly diagnosed 
Parkinson’s patients compared to controls. Eating nicotine-rich vegetables, 
especially peppers, was associated with significantly lower risk of Parkinson’s 
disease.58 (This effect was found only in the nonsmokers, which makes sense because 
the flood of nicotine from cigarettes would likely overwhelm any dietary effect.) This 
study may help explain previous protective associations in terms of Parkinson’s risk 
that had been tenuously found for tomato and potato consumption, as well as for the 
nightshade-rich Mediterranean diet.59 
The University of Washington researchers concluded that more research is needed 
before individuals should consider dietary interventions to prevent Parkinson’s 
disease, but when that intervention is simply enjoying more healthy dishes like 
stuffed peppers with tomato sauce, I don’t see a reason why you should have to wait. 
Dairy 
Parkinson’s patients have been found to have elevated levels of an organochlorine 
pesticide in their bloodstreams, the class of largely banned pesticides that includes 
DDT.60 Autopsy studies have also found elevated levels of pesticides in the brain 
tissue of those with Parkinson’s.61 Elevated levels of other pollutants like PCBs 
were also found in their brains, and the higher certain PCB concentrations, the higher 
the degree of damage found specifically in the brain region thought to be responsible 
for the disease, called the substantia nigra.62 As noted earlier, though many of these 
chemicals were banned decades ago, they may persist in the environment. You can 
continue to be exposed to them through the consumption of contaminated animal 
products in your diet, including dairy.63 Indeed, people who eat dairy-free, plant- 
based diets were found to have significantly lower blood levels of the PCBs 
implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease.64 
A meta-analysis of studies involving more than three hundred thousand 
participants found that overall dairy consumption was associated with significantly 
increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. They estimated that Parkinson’s risk may 
increase 17 percent for every daily cup of milk consumed.65 “Contamination of milk 
with neurotoxins may be of critical importance,” researchers offered by way of 
explanation.66 For example, neurotoxic chemicals like tetrahydroisoquinoline, a 
compound used to induce parkinsonism in primates in laboratory studies,67 appears 
to be found predominantly in cheese.68 The concentrations found were low, but the 
concern is that they may accumulate over a lifetime of consumption,69 resulting in the 
elevated levels found in the brains of Parkinson’s patients.70 There have been calls 
on the dairy industry to require screening of milk for such toxins,71 but they have so 
far gone unanswered. 
A recent nutrition journal editorial considered the case closed: “The only 
possible explanation for this effect is the evidence of the contamination of milk by 
neurotoxins.”72 But there are alternate explanations for the “clear-cut” link between 
dairy and Parkinson’s.73 For example, pollutant levels wouldn’t explain why 
Parkinson’s appears more closely tied to the consumption of the milk sugar lactose 
than to milk fat,74 more closely tied to milk than to butter.75 So maybe the culprit is 
galactose, the sugar in milk described in chapter 13, blamed for an increased risk of 
bone fractures, cancer, and death.76 Those with an inability to detoxify the galactose 
in milk not only suffer damage to their bones but also to their brains.77 This may help 
explain the link between milk intake and Parkinson’s, as well as the link between 
milk and another neurodegenerative disease called Huntington’s disease. Indeed, 
higher consumption of dairy products appears to double the risk of earlier-onset 
Huntington’s.78 
Another explanation is that milk consumption lowers blood levels of uric acid, an 
important brain antioxidant79 shown to protect nerve cells against the oxidative stress 
caused by pesticides.80 Uric acid may slow the progression of Huntington’s81 and 
Parkinson’s,82 and, most importantly, may lower the risk of getting Parkinson’s in the 
first place.83 Too much uric acid, however, can crystallize in your joints and cause a 
painful disease called gout, so uric acid can be thought of as a double-edged 
sword.84 Too much uric acid is also associated with heart disease and kidney 
disease; too little, with Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, 
and stroke.85 Those on dairy-free, plant-based diets appear to hit the sweet spot86 in 
terms of most optimal uric acid levels for longevity.87 
Milk may not do a body good, at least when it comes to your bones and brain. 
Plant-Based Diets and Pollutants 
As we’ve discussed, organochlorines are a group of chemicals that includes dioxins, 
PCBs, and such insecticides as DDT. Although most were banned decades ago, they 
persist in the environment and creep up the food chain into the fat of the animals 
people eat. 
What if you don’t eat any animal products at all? Researchers have “found that 
vegans were significantly less polluted than omnivores” when measuring levels of 
organochlorines in their blood, including a variety of PCBs and one of Monsanto’s 
long-banned Aroclor compounds.88 This finding is consistent with studies showing 
higher levels of organochlorine pesticides in the body fat89 and breast milk90 of those 
who eat meat. 
People eating completely plant-based diets have also been found to have 
markedly lower levels of dioxins in their bodies91 as well as decreased 
contamination with PBDEs,92 the flame-retardant chemical pollutants also linked to 
neurological problems.93 No surprise: The highest levels of flame retardants in the 
U.S. food supply have been found in fish, though the primary source of intake for 
most Americans is poultry, followed by processed meat.94 This discovery helps 
explain the significantly lower levels of PBDEs in the bodies of those eating meat- 
free diets.95 It appears that the more plant-based foods you eat and the longer you go 
without eating animal products, the lower your levels fall.96 No regulatory limits 
have been set for PBDEs in food, but as U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers 
noted in a survey of flame-retardant chemicals in domestic meat and poultry, 
“reducing the levels of unnecessary, persistent, toxic compounds in food and your 
diet is certainly desirable.”97 
Eating healthier can also reduce the concentrations of heavy metals in your body. 
The levels of mercury in the hair of those eating plant-based diets were found to be 
up to ten times lower than of those who ate fish.98 Within three months of switching to 
a plant-based diet, the levels of mercury, lead, and cadmium growing out in your hair 
appear to drop significantly (but build back up when meat and eggs are added back 
into the diet).99 Unlike heavy metals, though, some organochlorine pollutants can 
stick around for decades.100 Any DDT in your KFC may stay with you for the rest of 
your life. 
Berries 
Dr. James Parkinson, in his original, centuries-old description of the disease that 
bears his name, described a characteristic feature: “torpid” bowels, or constipation 
that may precede the diagnosis by many years.101 We’ve since learned that bowel- 
movement frequency may even be predictive of Parkinson’s. Men with less than daily 
bowel movements, for instance, were found to be four times more likely to develop 
the disease years later.102 Reverse causation has been suggested: Maybe constipation 
didn’t lead to Parkinson’s. Maybe Parkinson’s—even decades before it was 
diagnosed—led to constipation. This idea was supported by anecdotal evidence 
suggesting that throughout their lives, many who would go on to develop Parkinson’s 
reported never feeling very thirsty and, perhaps, decreased water intake contributed 
to their constipation.103 
Alternatively, given the link between dietary pollutants and Parkinson’s, 
constipation may be contributing directly to the disease: the longer feces stay in the 
bowel, the more neurotoxic chemicals in the diet may be absorbed.104 There are now 
more than one hundred studies linking pesticides to an increased risk for Parkinson’s 
disease,105 but many of them are based on subjects’ occupational or ambient 
exposure. Approximately one billion pounds of pesticides are applied annually in the 
United States,106 and simply living or working in high-spray areas may increase your 
risk.107 The use of common household pesticides like bug sprays is also associated 
with significantly increased risk.108 
How exactly do pesticides increase your risk for Parkinson’s? Scientists think 
they may cause DNA mutations that increase your susceptibility109 or affect the way 
certain proteins fold in your brain. In order for proteins to function effectively, they 
have to be the right shape. As you make new proteins in your cells, if they come out 
folded incorrectly, they are simply recycled, and your body tries again. Certain 
misfolded proteins, however, can take a shape that your body has difficulty breaking 
down. Should this glitch happen continuously, the malformed proteins can accumulate 
and result in the death of the brain’s nerve cells. Misfolded beta amyloid proteins, 
for example, are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (see chapter 3); misfolded prion 
proteins cause mad cow disease, a different malformed protein causes Huntington’s; 
and misfolded alpha synuclein proteins can lead to Parkinson’s disease.110 In the 
most comprehensive study of this sort to date, eight out of twelve common pesticides 
tested were able to trigger the accumulation of alpha synuclein proteins in human 
nerve cells in a petri dish.111 
As I’ve said, Parkinson’s disease is caused by the die-off of specialized nerve 
cells in a region of the brain that controls movement. By the time the first symptoms 
arise, 70 percent of these critical cells may already be dead.112 Pesticides are so 
good at killing these neurons that scientists often use pesticides in the laboratory to 
try to re-create Parkinson’s in animals to test new treatments.113 
If pesticides are killing off your brain cells, is there anything you can do to stop 
the process other than lowering your exposure to them? There are no known drugs 
that can prevent these misfolded proteins from accumulating, but certain 
phytonutrients called flavonoids—which are found in fruits and vegetables—may 
have protective effects. Researchers tested forty-eight different plant compounds able 
to cross the blood-brain barrier to see if any were able to stop alpha synuclein 
proteins from clumping together. To their surprise, not only did a variety of 
flavonoids inhibit these proteins from accumulating but they could also break up 
existing deposits.114 
This study suggests that by eating healthfully, you can reduce your exposure to 
pollutants while countering their effects at the same time. And when it comes to 
countering the effects of pesticides, berries may be particularly useful. In a head-to- 
head battle between pesticides and berries, researchers found that preincubating 
nerve cells with a blueberry extract allowed them to better withstand the debilitating 
effects of a common pesticide.115 But most such studies were performed on cells in a 
petri dish. Is there any evidence in people that eating berries could make a 
difference? 
A small study published decades ago suggested that the consumption of 
blueberries and strawberries might protect against Parkinson’s,116 but the question 
remained largely unanswered until a Harvard University study of about 130,000 
people found that people who eat more berries do indeed appear to have a 
significantly lower risk of developing the disease.117 
The editorial that accompanied the study in the journal Neurology concluded that 
more research is necessary, but “until then, an apple a day might be a good idea.”118 
Apples did appear protective against Parkinson’s, but only for men. Everyone, 
however, appeared to benefit from the consumption of blueberries and strawberries, 
the only berries included in the study.119 
If you do decide to follow my recommendation to eat berries every day, I would 
advise not serving them with cream. Not only has dairy been shown to block some of 
the beneficial effects of berries,120 but, as we saw earlier, dairy products may 
contain compounds that cause the very damage the berries may be trying to undo. 
Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification 
If people just eat from the bottom two levels of the food chain, only plants and plant 
eaters—that is, cows, pigs, and chickens fed grain and soybeans—why is the 
American populace so contaminated? Those of you who remember the mad cow 
disease story may know the answer. In modern agribusiness, there are essentially no 
more herbivores. 
Millions of tons of slaughterhouse by-products continue to be fed to farm animals 
in the United States every year.121 Not only have we turned these animals into meat 
eaters but virtual cannibals as well. When we feed farm animals millions of tons of 
meat and bonemeal, we’re also feeding them any pollutants this feed may contain. 
Then, after those animals are slaughtered, their trimmings go to feed the next 
generation of farm animals, potentially concentrating the pollutant levels higher and 
higher.122 So we can end up like polar bears or eagles at the top of the food chain and 
suffer the biomagnified pollutant consequences. When we eat these farmed animals, 
it’s almost as if we’re also eating every animal they ate. 
The use of slaughterhouse by-products in animal feed can recycle both toxic heavy 
metals and industrial chemicals back into the food supply. Lead accumulates in 
animal bones and mercury in animal protein123 (which is why egg whites contain up 
to twenty times more mercury than do yolks).124 Persistent lipophilic organic 
pollutants (known as PLOPs125—really!) build up in animal fat. Reducing meat 
consumption can help reduce exposure, but these contaminants can come back to us in 
a variety of animal products. “Although a vegetarian lifestyle can lower the body 
burden of PLOP, MMHg [mercury], and lead,” one toxicologist noted, “such benefits 
can be undermined by the consumption of contaminated milk and egg products. Farm 
animals that have been fed contaminated animal products produce contaminated milk 
and egg products.”126 
If you want to drop your PLOP, eat as low as possible on the food chain. 
Coffee for Preventing and Treating Parkinson’s Disease 
Could your cup of morning joe help prevent and perhaps even help treat one of our 
most crippling neurodegenerative conditions? It appears so. 
There have been at least nineteen studies performed on the role coffee may play in 
Parkinson’s, and overall, coffee consumption is associated with about one-third 
lower risk.127 The key ingredient appears to be the caffeine, since tea also seems 
protective128 and decaf coffee does not.129 Like the berry phytonutrients, caffeine has 
been shown to protect human nerve cells in a petri dish from being killed by a 
pesticide and other neurotoxins.130 
What about coffee for treating Parkinson’s? In a randomized controlled trial, 
giving Parkinson’s patients the caffeine equivalent of two cups of coffee a day (or 
approximately four cups of black tea or eight cups of green tea) significantly 
improved movement symptoms within three weeks.131 
Of course, there’s only so much you can charge for a cup of coffee, so drug 
companies have tried to tweak caffeine into new experimental drugs, such as 
preladenant and istradefylline. But it turns out they don’t appear to work any better 
than plain coffee, which is far cheaper and has a better safety record.132 
There are a number of simple things you can do that may decrease your risk of 
dying from Parkinson’s disease. You can wear seat belts and bicycle helmets to 
avoid getting hit in the head, you can exercise regularly,133 avoid becoming 
overweight,134 consume peppers, berries, and green tea, and minimize your exposure 
to pesticides, heavy metals, and dairy and other animal products. It’s worth it. Trust 
me when I say that no family should have to endure the tragedy of Parkinson’s. 
 CHAPTER 15 
How Not to Die from Iatrogenic Causes 
(or, How Not to Die from Doctors) 
As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That’s quaint, 
but a pound isn’t all that heavy. Why change your diet and lifestyle when you can just 
let modern medicine do its job of fixing you back up? 
Unfortunately, modern medicine isn’t nearly as effective as most people think.1 
Doctors excel at treating acute conditions, such as mending broken bones and curing 
infections, but for chronic diseases, which are the leading causes of death and 
disability, conventional medicine doesn’t have much to offer and, in fact, can 
sometimes do more harm than good. 
For example, side effects from medications given in hospitals kill an estimated 
106,000 Americans every year.2 That statistic alone effectively makes medical care 
the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. And this number reflects only the 
number of deaths from taking the drugs as prescribed. An additional 7,000 people die 
every year from receiving the wrong medication by mistake, and 20,000 others die 
from other hospital errors.3 Hospitals are dangerous places, and that’s not even 
counting the estimated 99,000 deaths each year due to hospital-acquired infections.4 
But can deaths from infections be blamed on doctors? They can if doctors won’t even 
wash their hands. 
We’ve known since the 1840s that hand washing is the best way to prevent 
hospital-acquired infections, yet compliance among health care workers rarely 
exceeds 50 percent. And doctors are the worst offenders.5 One study found that even 
in a medical intensive care unit, slapping up a “contact precautions” sign (signaling 
particularly high risk of infection) leads less than a quarter of doctors to properly 
wash their hands or use a hand sanitizer when treating patients.6 That’s right. Not 
even one doctor out of four washed his or her hands before laying them on the ill. 
Many physicians are concerned that should it become widely known how many 
people doctors inadvertently kill every year, it could “undermine public trust.”7 But 
if doctors can’t even be bothered to wash their hands, how much trust do we 
deserve? 
This unfortunate (and gross!) situation means that you could go in for a simple 
operation and come out with a life-threatening infection—if you come out at all. 
Every year, 12,000 Americans die from complications due to surgeries that weren’t 
even necessary in the first place. For those keeping score, that’s more than 200,000 
people dead from so-called iatrogenic causes (from the Ancient Greek iatrós, 
meaning “doctor”). And that figure is based only on the data on hospitalized patients. 
In outpatient settings—for instance, at your doctor’s office—prescription drug side 
effects alone may result in 199,000 additional deaths.8 
The Institute of Medicine estimates that medical errors may kill even more 
Americans, up to 98,000,9 bringing the total annual death count closer to 300,000. 
That’s more than the entire population of cities like Newark, Buffalo, or Orlando. 
Even using more conservative estimates of deaths due to medical errors, health care 
comes in as the real third-leading cause of death in America.10 
How did the medical community respond to such damning conclusions? Deafening 
silence in both word and deed.11 The first such report, which appeared in 1978, 
suggested that about 120,000 deaths occurring in hospitals could be prevented.12 
Then, sixteen years later, another scathing reminder was published in the Journal of 
the American Medical Association, suggesting the iatrogenic death toll may be “the 
equivalent of three jumbo-jet crashes every 2 days.”13 In the years between these two 
reports, as many as nearly two million Americans may have died due to medical 
errors, yet the medical community refused to comment on this tragedy and made no 
substantial effort to reduce the number of deaths.14 Another estimated 600,000 deaths 
later, the prestigious Institute of Medicine released its own landmark report on the 
catastrophic consequences of medical error15—but again, little was done as a 
result.16 
Eventually, a few changes were implemented. For instance, interns and residents 
could no longer be made to work for more than eighty hours a week (at least on 
paper), and shifts couldn’t be more than thirty consecutive hours long. That may not 
sound like a big step, but when I started my internship after graduating from medical 
school, we worked thirty-six-hour shifts every three days—combined with our other 
days of work, that added up to a 117-hour work week. When interns and residents are 
forced to pull all-nighters, studies suggest they may make 36 percent more serious 
medical errors, five times more diagnostic errors, and have twice as many 
“attentional failures” (such as nodding off during surgery).17 The patient is supposed 
to be asleep during surgery, not the surgeon. It’s no surprise, then, that overworked 
doctors may cause 300 percent more fatigue-related medical errors that lead to 
patient death.18 
If every single day airliners crashed and killed hundreds of people, we would 
expect the Federal Aviation Administration to step in and do something. Why doesn’t 
anyone confront the medical profession? Instead of just releasing reports, entities like 
the Institute of Medicine could have demanded that doctors and hospitals adopt at 
least a minimum set of preventive practices, such as bar-coding drugs to avoid mix- 
ups.19 (You know, something they do even on a package of Twinkies at the grocery 
store.) 
Only people on medications are killed by medication errors or the drugs’ side 
effects, though. You have to actually be in the hospital to be killed by a hospital error 
or get an infection there. The good news is that most visits to doctors are for diseases 
that can be prevented with a healthy diet and lifestyle.20 
The best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical tests and treatments is not to 
avoid doctors but to avoid getting sick in the first place. 
Radiation 
There are risks associated not only with medical treatment but also sometimes with 
diagnosis. A paper entitled “Estimated Risks of Radiation-Induced Fatal Cancer from 
Pediatric CT” out of Columbia University in 2001 reignited long-standing concerns 
about the risks associated with medical diagnostic radiation exposure. CT, or CAT, 
scans use multiple x-rays from different angles to create cross-sectional images, 
exposing the body to hundreds of times more radiation than a simple x-ray.21 Based 
on the excess cancer risk of Hiroshima survivors exposed to similar doses of 
radiation,22 it was estimated that out of all children who undergo abdominal or head 
CT scans every year, five hundred “might ultimately die from cancer attributable to 
the CT radiation.”23 In response to this revelation, the editor in chief of a leading 
radiology journal conceded, “We radiologists may be as guilty as others when it 
comes to not watching out for children.”24 
The risk of developing cancer after a single CT scan may be as high as 1 in 150 
for a baby girl.25 In general, the diagnostic medical radiation dealt out in one year is 
estimated to cause 2,800 breast cancers among American women, as well as 25,000 
other cancers.26 In other words, doctors may be causing tens of thousands of cancers 
every year. 
Patients undergoing these scans are rarely informed of these risks. For example, 
did you know that getting a chest CT scan is estimated to inflict the same cancer risk 
as smoking seven hundred cigarettes?27 One in every 270 middle-aged women may 
develop cancer due to a single angiogram.28 CT scans and x-rays can be lifesaving, 
but good evidence suggests that one-fifth to one-half of all CT scans aren’t necessary 
at all and could be replaced with a safer type of imaging or simply not performed at 
all.29 
Many people expressed concern about the radiation exposure from the full-body 
scanners at airports using backscatter x-rays,30 but those machines have since been 
phased out. The airplane itself, however, is a different story. Because you’re exposed 
to more cosmic rays from outer space at higher altitudes, just one round-trip, cross- 
country flight may subject you to about the same level of radiation as a chest x-ray.31 
(Given my past speaking schedule, I should be glowing in the dark by now!) 
Is there anything you can do to mediate the radiation risk? As with so many other 
health questions, the answer is that you can eat healthfully. 
In an investigation funded by the National Cancer Institute, researchers studied the 
diets and chromosome integrity of airline pilots, who get zapped with radiation daily, 
to see which foods might be protective. They found that pilots who consumed the 
most dietary antioxidants suffered the least amount of DNA damage to their bodies. 
Note the word dietary. Antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and E, didn’t 
seem to help. Pilots who consumed the most vitamin C through fruits and vegetables, 
though, appeared to be protected.32 Taking antioxidant supplements may be more than 
just a waste of money. People given 500 mg of vitamin C a day were found to end up 
with more oxidative DNA damage.33 
Remember that natural antioxidants in food work synergistically; it’s the 
combination of many different compounds working together that tends to protect you, 
not high doses of single antioxidants found in supplements. Indeed, those pilots eating 
a mix of phytonutrients, concentrated in a variety of such plant foods as citrus, nuts, 
seeds, pumpkins, and peppers, had the lowest levels of DNA damage in response to 
the radiation they were bombarded with every day from the galaxy.34 
The research team found that green, leafy vegetables like spinach and kale appear 
to have an edge over other vegetables and fruits when it comes to radiation 
protection.35 All this time I’ve been packing kale chips on flights just because they’re 
so lightweight, but it also turns out they may be protecting my DNA. 
The same plant-based protection enjoyed by pilots was also found among atomic 
bomb survivors. For several decades, researchers have followed thirty-six thousand 
survivors of the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those who ate 
vegetable- or fruit-rich diets appeared to cut their cancer risk by about 36 percent.36 
We saw the same thing in the aftermath of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear 
reactor in Ukraine, where consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables apparently 
protected children’s immune systems, while egg and fish consumption was associated 
with a significantly increased risk of DNA damage. The researchers suggest this 
result could have been due to the possibility that the animal foods they ate were 
contaminated with radioactive elements or the role of animal fats in free-radical 
formation.37 
Nuclear events offer a rare opportunity to study these effects on humans since, 
obviously, it is unethical to intentionally expose people to radiation. However, as 
we’ve learned from declassified documents about U.S. Cold War radiation 
experiments, this didn’t stop our government from injecting “colored” people with 
plutonium38 or feeding “retarded” children radioactive isotopes in their breakfast 
cereal.39 Despite the Pentagon’s insistence that these methods were the “only feasible 
means” of developing ways to protect people from radiation,40 researchers have 
since come up with a few methods that don’t violate the Nuremburg Code. 
One is to study human cells in a test tube. Research has found, for example, that 
white blood cells blasted with gamma rays suffered less DNA damage when the cells 
had been pretreated with phytonutrients from ginger root. The ginger compounds 
protected DNA nearly as well as the leading radiation sickness drug41 at 150 times 
lower the dose.42 Those taking ginger in order to prevent motion sickness during air 
travel may be protecting themselves against more than just nausea. 
Other common foods that may be protective against radiation damage include 
garlic, turmeric, goji berries, and mint leaves,43 but none of these has been tested in 
clinical studies. How can we test the protective power of foods in people rather than 
petri dishes? To study how diet may protect against cosmic rays, airline pilots were 
studied. Guess who they studied to see if foods could be protective against x-rays? 
X-ray technicians. 
Hospital workers who routinely operate x-ray machines have been found to suffer 
more chromosomal damage and to have higher levels of oxidative stress compared 
with other hospital workers.44 For this reason, researchers recruited a group of x-ray 
techs and asked them to drink two cups of lemon balm tea each day for a month. 
(Lemon balm is an herb in the mint family.) Even in that short time frame, the lemon 
balm tea appeared able to boost the level of antioxidant enzymes in the subjects’ 
bloodstreams while also reducing the amount of DNA damage they suffered.45 
The Actual Benefit of Diet Versus Drugs 
Based on a study of more than one hundred thousand Minnesotans, it appears that 
seven out of ten people may be prescribed at least one prescription drug in any given 
year. More than half are prescribed two or more drugs, and 20 percent are 
prescribed five or more medications.46 All told, physicians dispense about four 
billion prescriptions for drugs every year in the United States.47 That’s about thirteen 
prescriptions a year for every man, woman, and child. 
The two prescription drugs most often brought up in doctor visits are simvastatin, 
a cholesterol-lowering medication, and lisinopril, a blood-pressure pill.48 So a lot of 
drugs are being doled out in an attempt to prevent disease. But how well are these 
billions of pills working? 
An overconfidence in the power of pills and procedures for disease prevention 
may be one of the reasons doctors and patients alike may undervalue diet and 
lifestyle interventions. When surveyed, people tend to wildly overestimate the ability 
of mammograms and colonoscopies to prevent cancer deaths, or the power of drugs 
like Fosamax to prevent hip fractures, or drugs like Lipitor to prevent fatal heart 
attacks.49 Patients believe cholesterol-lowering statin drugs are about twenty times 
more effective than they actually are in preventing heart attacks.50 No wonder most 
people continue to rely on drugs to save them! But the dirty little secret is that most 
people surveyed said they wouldn’t be willing to take many of these drugs if they 
knew how little benefit these products actually offered.51 
How ineffectual are some of the most common drugs in America? When it comes 
to cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood-thinning drugs, the chance of even high-risk 
patients benefiting from them is typically less than 5 percent over a period of five 
years.52 When asked, most patients say they want to be told the truth.53 However, as 
doctors, we know that if we divulged this information, few of our patients would 
agree to take these drugs every day for the rest of their lives, which would be 
detrimental for the small percentage of people who do truly benefit from them. That’s 
why doctors in the know and drug companies oversell the benefits by conveniently 
not mentioning how tiny these benefits actually are. When it comes to chronic disease 
management, practicing conventional medicine can be thought of as practicing 
deceptive medicine. 
For the hundreds of millions of people on these drugs who don’t benefit, it’s not 
simply a matter of all the money spent and all the side effects endured. To me, the 
true tragedy is all the lost opportunities to address the root causes of patients’ 
conditions. When people dramatically overestimate how much their prescription pills 
protect them, they may be less likely to make the dietary changes necessary to 
dramatically lower their risk. 
Take cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, for example. The best they may be able to 
offer in terms of absolute risk reduction for a subsequent heart attack or death is 
about 3 percent over six years.54 Meanwhile, a whole-food, plant-based diet may 
work twenty times better, potentially offering an absolute risk reduction of 60 percent 
after fewer than four years.55 In 2014, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. published a case 
series of about two hundred people with significant heart disease showing that a 
healthy enough plant-based diet may prevent further major cardiac episodes in 99.4 
percent of patients who follow it.56 
You don’t really have the luxury of choosing between following a healthy diet or 
taking a pill to prevent a heart attack because pills may not work in the near term in 
97 percent of the cases. Of course, diet and drugs are not mutually exclusive, and 
many under Dr. Esselstyn’s care wisely continued to take their cardiac meds. You 
just need to have a realistic understanding of how limited a role the contents of your 
medicine cabinets play compared to the contents of your refrigerator. Heart disease 
may continue to be the number-one killer of men, women, and eventually our children 
if doctors continue to rely on drugs and stents. However, if you eat a healthy enough 
diet, you may be able to reverse the stranglehold it has on your heart. That is 
something doctors can be proud to divulge to our patients. 
Aspirin 
How well do over-the-counter drugs perform? For example, take aspirin. Perhaps the 
most commonly used medication in the world,57 it’s been around in pill form for over 
a century. Its active ingredient, salicylic acid, has been used in its natural form (as an 
extract of willow tree bark) to ease pain and fever for thousands of years.58 One of 
the reasons it remains so popular—despite the fact that better anti-inflammatory 
painkillers exist now—is that it’s used by millions of people on a daily basis as a 
blood thinner to reduce the risk of a heart attack. As we saw in chapter 1, heart 
attacks often occur when a blood clot forms in response to a ruptured atherosclerotic 
plaque in one of your coronary arteries. Taking aspirin may help stop this from 
happening. 
Aspirin may also lower the risk of cancer.59 It works by suppressing an enzyme 
within your body that creates pro-clotting factors, thereby thinning your blood. At the 
same time, aspirin suppresses proinflammatory compounds called prostaglandins, 
which in turn reduces pain, swelling, and fever. Prostaglandins may also dilate the 
lymph vessels inside tumors, potentially allowing cancer cells to spread. One of the 
ways scientists think aspirin helps prevent cancer deaths is by counteracting a 
tumor’s attempts to pry open the lymphatic bars on its cage and spread throughout the 
body.60 
So should everyone take a “baby”-strength aspirin a day? (Note that aspirin 
should never actually be given to infants or children.)61 No. The problem is that 
aspirin can cause side effects. The same blood-thinning benefit that can prevent a 
heart attack can also cause a hemorrhagic stroke, in which you bleed into your brain. 
Aspirin can also damage the lining of the digestive tract. For those who’ve already 
had a heart attack and continue to eat the same diet that led to the first one (and are 
therefore at exceedingly high risk of having another one), the risk-benefit analysis 
seems clear: Taking aspirin would probably prevent about six times more serious 
problems than it causes you. But among the general population who have yet to have 
their first heart attack, the risks and benefits are more closely matched.62 Thus, taking 
an aspirin a day is generally not recommended.63 Throw in even a 10 percent 
reduction in cancer mortality, though, and it could tip the risk-benefit balance in favor 
of aspirin.64 Given that regular, low-dose aspirin use may reduce the risk of cancer 
mortality by one-third,65 it is tempting to recommend it for nearly everyone. If only 
you could get the benefits without the risks. 
Well, maybe you can. 
The willow tree isn’t the only plant that contains salicylic acid. It’s widely found 
in many of the fruits and vegetables in the plant kingdom.66 That’s why you often find 
the active ingredient of aspirin in the bloodstreams of people who aren’t taking it.67 
The more fruits and vegetables you eat, the higher your level of salicylic acid may 
rise.68 In fact, the levels of people eating plant-based diets actually overlap with 
those of some people taking low-dose aspirin.69 
With all that salicylic acid flowing through their systems, you might think plant 
eaters would have higher ulcer rates, because aspirin is known to chew away at the 
gut. But those following plant-based diets actually appear to have a significantly 
lower risk of ulcers.70 How is that possible? Because in plants, the salicylic acid 
may come naturally prepackaged with gut-protective nutrients. For example, nitric 
oxide from dietary nitrates exerts stomach-protective effects by boosting blood flow 
and protective mucus production in the lining of the stomach, effects which 
demonstrably oppose the pro-ulcerative impact of aspirin.71 So, for the general 
population, by eating plants instead of taking aspirin, individuals may not only get 
aspirin’s benefits without its risks but also get the benefits—with benefits. 
People who have had a heart attack should follow their physician’s advice, which 
probably includes taking aspirin every day. But what about everyone else? I think 
everyone should take aspirin—but in the form of produce, not a pill. 
The salicylic acid content in plants may help explain why traditional, plant-based 
diets were so protective. For instance, before their diets were Westernized, animal 
products made up only about 5 percent of the average Japanese diet.72 During this 
period in the 1950s, age-adjusted death rates from colon, prostate, breast, and 
ovarian cancers were five to ten times lower in Japan than in the United States, while 
incidences of pancreatic cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma were three to four times 
lower. This phenomenon was not unique to the Japanese. As we’ve seen throughout 
this book, Western rates of cancers and heart disease have been found to be 
dramatically lower among populations whose diets are centered around plant 
foods.73 
If part of this protection arises from the aspirin phytonutrients, which plants in 
particular are packed with the stuff? While salicylic acid is ubiquitously present in 
fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices contain the highest concentrations.74 Chili 
powder, paprika, and turmeric are rich in the compound, but cumin has the most per 
serving. Indeed, just one teaspoon of ground cumin may be about the equivalent of a 
baby aspirin. This may help explain why India, with its spice-rich diets, has among 
the lowest worldwide rates of colorectal cancer75—the cancer that appears most 
sensitive to the effects of aspirin.76 
And the spicier, the better! A spicy vegetable vindaloo has been calculated to 
contain four times the salicylic acid content of a milder madras-style veggie dish. Eat 
a single meal, and you can get the same spike in salicylic acid in your bloodstream as 
if you took an aspirin.77 
The benefits of salicylic acid are another reason you should strive to choose 
organic produce. Because the plant uses the compound as a defense hormone, its 
concentration may be increased when that plant is bitten by bugs. Pesticide-laden 
plants aren’t nibbled as much and, perhaps as a result, appear to produce less 
salicylic acid. For example, in one study, soup made from organic vegetables was 
found to contain nearly six times more salicylic acid than soup prepared from 
conventional, nonorganically grown ingredients.78 
Another way to get more salicylic acid bang for your buck is by opting for whole 
foods. Whole-grain breads, for example, not only offer more salicylic acid but may 
contain one hundred times more phytochemicals in general than white bread— 
reportedly eight hundred compared with approximately eight.79 
Attention has been focused on salicylic acid because of the voluminous data on 
aspirin, but hundreds of the other phytonutrients have been found to have anti- 
inflammatory and antioxidant activity as well. Still, given the strength of the aspirin 
evidence, there are those in the public health community who talk of a widespread 
“salicylic acid deficiency,” proposing that the compound be classed as an essential 
vitamin: “Vitamin S.”80 Whether it’s the salicylic acid or a combination of other 
phytonutrients that account for the benefits of whole plant foods, the solution is the 
same: Eat more of them. 
Colonoscopies 
The colonoscopy. You’ll be hard pressed to find a more dreaded routine procedure. 
Every year, U.S. doctors may perform more than fourteen million colonoscopies,81 an 
exam used to detect abnormal changes in the large intestine (colon) and rectum. 
During the procedure, doctors insert a five-foot-long flexible tube fitted with a tiny 
video camera and inflate the colon with air to visualize the colon lining. Any 
suspicious polyps or other abnormal tissue can be biopsied during the procedure. 
Colonoscopies can help doctors diagnose causes of rectal bleeding or chronic 
diarrhea, but routine colon cancer screenings may be the most common reason they 
are performed. 
The reasons doctors often find it difficult to convince their patients to keep 
coming back for colonoscopies include the necessary bowel prep, during which you 
have to drink quarts of a powerful liquid laxative before the procedure to completely 
clean yourself out. There’s also the pain and discomfort of the procedure itself82 
(though you’re purposefully given drugs with amnesiac effects so you won’t 
remember how it felt),83 feelings of embarrassment and vulnerability, and the fear of 
complications.84 These fears are not unfounded. Despite how routinely 
colonoscopies are performed, serious complications occur in about 1 out of every 
350 cases, including such issues as perforations and fatal bleeding.85 Perforations 
can occur when the tip of the colonoscope punctures the wall of the colon, when the 
colon is overinflated, or when a doctor cauterizes a bleeding biopsy site. In 
extremely rare cases, this cautery can ignite some residual gas and cause the colon to 
literally explode.86 
Death from colonoscopy is rare, occurring in only about 1 in every 2,500 
procedures.87 Yet this means colonoscopies may be killing thousands of Americans 
every year, raising the question: Do the benefits outweigh the risks? 
Colonoscopies are not the only screening technique for colon cancer. The U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the official prevention guidelines body, 
considers colonoscopies just one of three acceptable colon-cancer screening 
strategies. Starting at age fifty, everyone should get either a colonoscopy once a 
decade, have their stool tested for hidden blood every year (which involves no 
scoping at all), or have a sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing 
every three. The evidence supporting “virtual” colonoscopies or DNA stool testing 
was judged insufficient.88 Though routine screenings are no longer recommended at 
age seventy-five, this assumes you’ve been testing negative for twenty-five years. If 
you’re now seventy-five and have never been screened, then it’s probably a good 
idea to get screened at least into your eighties.89 
Sigmoidoscopy uses a much smaller scope than in a colonoscopy and has ten 
times fewer complications.90 However, because the scope may only go about two 
feet inside your body, it might miss tumors farther inside. So which is better overall? 
We won’t know until randomized controlled colonoscopy trials are published in the 
mid-2020s.91 Most other developed countries do not recommend either scoping 
procedure, though. For routine colon cancer screening, they still endorse the 
noninvasive stool blood testing.92 
Which of the three options is best for you? The USPSTF recommends that the 
decision should be made on an individualized basis after weighing the benefits and 
risks with your doctor. 
To what extent, though, do doctors inform patients of their options? Researchers 
audiotaped clinic visits to find out. They were looking for the nine essential elements 
of informed decision making, which include explaining the pros and cons of each 
option, describing the alternatives, and making sure the patient understands these 
options.93 
Unfortunately, when it came to colon cancer screening, in most cases, the doctors 
and nurse practitioners studied communicated none of this vital information, zero out 
of nine elements.94 As an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association put it: “There are too many probabilities and uncertainties for patients to 
consider and too little time for clinicians to discuss them with patients.”95 So doctors 
tend to just make up patients’ minds for them. What do they choose? A National 
Cancer Institute–funded survey of more than one thousand physicians found that 
nearly all doctors (94.8 percent) recommended a colonoscopy.96 Why do doctors 
push colonoscopies in the United States when most of the rest of the world appears to 
prefer noninvasive alternatives?97 It may be because most doctors in the rest of the 
world don’t get paid by procedure.98 As one U.S. gastroenterologist put it, 
“Colonoscopy … is the goose that has laid the golden egg.”99 
An exposé in the New York Times on spiraling health care costs noted that in many 
other developed countries, colonoscopies cost just a few hundred dollars. In the 
United States? The procedure may cost thousands, which the journalists concluded 
has less to do with providing top-notch medical care and more with business plans 
aimed at maximizing revenue, marketing, and lobbying.100 Who’s in charge of setting 
the prices? The American Medical Association. A Washington Post  investigation 
exposed that each year, a secretive AMA committee determines billing standards for 
common procedures. The result is gross overestimates for the time it takes to perform 
common services like colonoscopies. As the Post pointed out, if AMA standards are 
to be believed, some doctors would have to work more than twenty-four hours a day 
to perform all the procedures they report to Medicare and private insurers. Is it any 
wonder that gastroenterologists bank nearly $500,000 per year?101 
But why would your family doctor or internist push the procedure if they’re not 
the ones doing it? Many doctors who refer their patients to gastroenterologists 
receive what are essentially financial kickbacks. The U.S. Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) reported on this practice of so-called self-referrals, a 
scheme where providers refer patients to entities in which they have a financial 
interest. The GAO estimated that doctors make nearly a million more referrals every 
year than they would have if they were not personally profiting.102 
What to Take Before a Colonoscopy 
Ever popped one of those breath mints after a big meal at a restaurant? Peppermint 
doesn’t just make your breath smell better; it also helps to reduce the gastrocolic 
reflex—the urge to defecate following a meal. Nerves in your stomach stretch after 
eating, which triggers spasms in the colon to enable your body to make room for 
more food coming down the pike. Peppermint can reduce these spasms by relaxing 
the muscles that line your colon.103 
What does this have to do with colonoscopies? If you take circular strips of 
human colons removed during surgery and lay them on a table, they spontaneously 
contract about three times per minute. Isn’t that kind of creepy? But if you drip 
menthol (found in peppermint) onto the colon strips, the strength of the contractions 
diminishes significantly.104 During a colonoscopy, such spasms can hinder the 
progress of the scope and cause the patient discomfort. By relaxing colon muscles, 
peppermint can make the procedure easier for both doctor and patient. 
Doctors have experimented with spraying peppermint oil from the tip of the 
colonoscope,105 as well as using a hand pump to flood the colon with a peppermint 
solution prior to the procedure.106 The simplest solution might be the best, though: 
asking the patient to swallow peppermint oil capsules. Premedicating with eight 
drops’ worth of peppermint essential oil four hours before a colonoscopy was found 
to significantly reduce colon spasms, patient pain, and make the scope easier to insert 
and withdraw compared with a placebo.107 
If you do need a colonoscopy, ask your doctor about using this simple plant 
remedy. It might make it easier on both of you. 
Clearly, patients in America may be getting more medical care than they really 
need. So said Dr. Barbara Starfield, who literally wrote the book on primary care.108 
One of our nation’s most prestigious physicians, she composed the scathing 
commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association naming medical 
care as the third-leading cause of death in the United States.109 
Her primary-care work has been widely embraced, but her findings on the 
potentially ineffective and even harmful nature of U.S. health care received almost no 
attention. “The American public appears to have been hoodwinked into believing that 
more interventions lead to better health,” she later said in an interview.110 As one 
health care quality advisor noted, the widespread disregard of Dr. Starfield’s 
evidence “recalls the dark dystopia of George Orwell’s 1984, where awkward facts 
swallowed up by the ‘memory hole’ become as if they had never existed at all.”111 
Sadly, Dr. Starfield is no longer with us. Ironically, she may have died from one 
of the adverse drug reactions she so vociferously warned us about. After she was 
placed on two blood thinners to prevent a stent in her heart from clogging up, she told 
her cardiologist she was bruising more and bleeding longer—that’s the drug risk you 
hope doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Then Dr. Starfield died after apparently hitting 
her head while swimming and bleeding into her brain.112 
The question I ask myself is not whether she should have been put on two blood 
thinners for as long as she was—or whether she should have had the stent inserted to 
begin with. Rather, I wonder if she could have avoided the medication and the 
surgery both by avoiding the heart disease in the first place. Heart attacks are 
considered 96 percent avoidable in women who eat a wholesome diet and engage in 
other healthy lifestyle behaviors.113 The number-one killer of women need almost 
never happen. 
 PART 2 
 Introduction 
In part 1 of this book, I explored the science that demonstrates the role a plant-based 
diet rich in certain foods may play in helping to prevent, treat, and even reverse the 
fifteen leading causes of death. For those who may have already been diagnosed with 
one or more of these diseases, the information in part 1 can be lifesaving. But for 
everyone else—perhaps those worried about inheriting their family history of illness 
or those who simply want their diet to promote health and longevity—the primary 
question might concern food choices to make day in and day out. I have given more 
than a thousand presentations, and one of the most common questions I get is, “What 
do you eat every day, Dr. Greger?” 
This, part 2 of How Not to Die, is my response to that question. 
*   *   * 
I’ve never had so much a sweet tooth as a grease tooth. Pepperoni pizza. Chicken 
wings by the basket. Sour cream–and-onion potato chips. A Hardee’s bacon 
cheeseburger nearly every day during high school. Anything oily and fatty—and all 
washed down with an ice-cold Dr Pepper. Okay, so maybe a little sweet tooth. I also 
really liked strawberry-frosted doughnuts. 
Even though my grandma’s miraculous recovery from heart disease inspired me to 
pursue a career in medicine, I didn’t clean up my own diet until the publication of Dr. 
Ornish’s landmark Lifestyle Heart Trial in 1990. I was such a nerd in high school that 
I would spend my summer vacations hanging out in the science library at the local 
university. And there it was, published in the most prestigious medical journal in the 
world—proof that my family’s story was not a fluke: Heart disease could be 
reversed. Dr. Ornish and his team had taken before-and-after x-rays of people’s 
arteries and demonstrated how they could be opened up without angioplasty. No 
surgery. No miracle drug. Just a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle changes. 
That’s what motivated me to change my own diet and ignited my twenty-five-year 
love affair with nutritional science. From that point forward, I have been determined 
to spread the word about food’s power to make you healthy, keep you healthy, and, if 
necessary, return you to health. 
For the purposes of this book, I’ve created two simple tools to help you integrate 
everything I’ve learned into your own daily life: 
1. a Traffic Light system to quickly identify the healthiest options, and 
2. a Daily Dozen checklist that will help you incorporate the foods that I consider 
essential to the optimal diet. (Check out the free app on iPhone and Android.) 
*   *   * 
So which foods are good for you, and which are bad? 
This sounds like a simple enough question. In truth, I’ve found it difficult to 
answer. Whenever I’m asked at a lecture whether a certain food is healthy or not, I 
have to invariably reply, “Compared to what?” For example, are eggs healthy? 
Compared to oatmeal, definitely not. But compared to the sausage links next to them 
on the breakfast platter? Yes. 
What about white potatoes? They’re vegetables, so they must be healthy, right? 
Someone asked me this a few years ago after a group of Harvard University 
researchers raised concerns about baked and mashed potatoes.1 So are they healthy? 
Compared to french fries, yes. Compared to a baked or mashed sweet potato? No, 
they’re not. 
I realize these may not be satisfying answers for people who just want to know 
whether or not to eat the darned potato, but the only way to answer the question 
meaningfully is to ask what your other options are. If you’re in a fast-food joint, for 
example, a baked potato may very well be your healthiest option. 
Compared to what? is not just a Socratic learning exercise I have practiced with 
my patients and students. Eating is essentially a zero-sum game: When you choose to 
eat one thing, you are generally choosing not to eat another. Sure, you could just go 
hungry, but eventually your body tends to balance things out by eating more later. So 
anything we choose to eat has an opportunity cost. 
Every time you put something in your mouth, it’s a lost opportunity to put 
something even healthier in there. Think of it as having $2,000 in your daily caloric 
bank. How do you want to spend it? For the same number of calories, you can eat one 
Big Mac, one hundred strawberries, or a five-gallon bucket of salad. Of course, these 
three options don’t exactly fill the same culinary niche—if you want a burger, you 
want a burger, and I don’t expect quarts of strawberries to make it on the Dollar 
Menu anytime soon—but this is an illustration of how mountainous a nutritional bang 
you can get for the same caloric buck. 
The opportunity costs exacted are not only the nutrients you could otherwise be 
getting but the unhealthy components you could otherwise be avoiding. After all, 
when was the last time you had a friend diagnosed with kwashiorkor, scurvy, or 
pellagra? These are some of the traditional nutrient-deficiency diseases upon which 
the foundation of the field of nutrition was built. To this day, the nutrition and dietetic 
professions remain focused on what nutrients we may be lacking, but most of our 
chronic diseases may have more to do with what we’re getting too much of. Know 
anyone suffering from obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, or high blood pressure? 
Isn’t It Expensive to Eat Healthfully? 
Researchers at Harvard University compared the cost and healthfulness of various 
foods across the country, hunting for the best bargains. They found that in terms of 
nutritional bang for your buck, people should buy more nuts, soy foods, beans, and 
whole grains, and less meat and dairy. They concluded: “The purchase of plant- 
based foods may offer the best investment for dietary health.”2 
Less healthy foods only beat out healthier foods on a cost-per-calorie basis, 
which is a way we measured food cost back in the nineteenth century. Back then, the 
emphasis was on cheap calories, no matter how you got them. So while beans and 
sugar both cost the same at that time (five cents a pound), the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture promoted sugar as more cost effective for pure “fuel value.”3 
The USDA can be excused for discounting the nutritional difference between 
beans and pure sugar. After all, vitamins hadn’t even been discovered yet. 
Nowadays, we know better and can compare the cost of foods based on their 
nutritional content. An average serving of vegetables may cost roughly four times 
more than the average serving of junk food, but those veggies have been calculated to 
average twenty-four times more nutrition. So on a cost-per-nutrition basis, vegetables 
offer six times more nutrition per dollar compared to highly processed foods. Meat 
costs about three times more than vegetables yet yields sixteen times less nutrition 
based on an aggregate of nutrients.4 Because meat is less nutritious and costs more, 
vegetables net you forty-eight times more nutrition per dollar than meat. 
If your intent is to shovel as many calories as possible into your mouth for the 
least amount of money, then healthier foods lose out, but if you want to shovel the 
most nutrition into your mouth as cheaply as possible, look no further than the 
produce aisle. Spending just fifty cents more per day on fruits and vegetables may 
buy you a 10 percent drop in mortality.5 Now that’s a bargain! Imagine if there were 
a pill that could reduce your chance of dying by 10 percent over the next decade and 
only had good side effects. How much do you think the drug company would charge? 
Probably more than fifty cents. 
Dining by Traffic Light 
The U.S. government’s official Dietary Guidelines for Americans has (as of this 
writing) a chapter “Food Components to Reduce,” which specifically lists added 
sugars, calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, sodium, and trans fat.6 At the same time, 
there are nine so-called shortfall nutrients, of which at least a quarter of the 
American population isn’t reaching an adequate intake. These are fiber; the minerals 
calcium, magnesium, and potassium; and vitamins A, C, D, E, and K.7 But you don’t 
eat food “components.” You eat food. There’s no magnesium aisle in the grocery 
store. So which foods tend to have the most of the good stuff and the least of the bad? 
I’ve simplified it into a traffic light illustration (see figure 5). 
Just as on the road, green means go, yellow means caution, and red means stop. 
(In this case, stop and think before you put it into your mouth.) Ideally, green-light 
foods should be maximized, yellow-light ones minimized, and red-light foods 
avoided. 
I s avoid too strong a word? After all, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
merely encourage you to “moderate” your intake of unhealthy foods.8 For example: 
“Eat less … candy.”9 From a health standpoint, though, shouldn’t you generally try to 
avoid candy? Public health authorities don’t just advise you to smoke less tobacco. 
They tell you to quit. They know only a small fraction of smokers will actually heed 
this advice, but it’s the job of public health authorities to say what’s best and let 
people make up their own minds. 
Figure 5 
That’s why I appreciate the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) 
recommendations. Not beholden to the USDA, the AICR simply lays out the science. 
When it comes to the worst of the worst, the institute doesn’t pull any punches. 
Instead of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans’ advice to “Consume fewer … 
sodas,”10 the AICR cancer prevention guidelines advise: “Avoid sugary drinks.” 
Similarly, the AICR doesn’t just say to cut back on bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausage, 
and lunch meats. The cancer guidelines tell you to “avoid processed meat.” Period. 
Why? Because “data do not show any level of intake that can confidently be shown 
not to be associated with risk.”11 
The healthiest diet is one that maximizes the intake of whole plant foods and 
minimizes the intake of animal-based foods and processed junk. Simply put, eat more 
green-light foods. Eat fewer yellow-light foods. And, especially, eat even fewer red- 
light foods. Just like running red lights in the real world, you may be able to get away 
with it once in a while, but I wouldn’t recommend making a habit out of it. 
Given this, what we’ve seen in the previous chapters makes a lot of sense. 
Unprocessed plant foods tend to have more of the protective nutrients that Americans 
are lacking and fewer disease-promoting factors. No wonder the eating habit 
apparently best able to control our epidemics of dietary disease is a whole-food, 
plant-based diet. After all, food is a package deal. 
This is one of the most important concepts in all of nutrition. Yes, there is calcium 
in cheese, protein in pork, and iron in beef, but what about all the baggage that comes 
along with these nutrients—the dose of dairy hormones, the lard, the saturated fat? As 
much as Burger King proclaims you can “Have It Your Way,” you can’t go up to the 
counter and ask for a burger, hold the saturated fat and cholesterol. Food is, indeed, a 
package deal. 
Dairy is the number-one source of calcium in the United States, but it’s also the 
number-one source of saturated fat. What kind of “baggage” do you get along with the 
calcium in green, leafy vegetables? Fiber, folate, iron, and antioxidants—some of the 
very nutrients lacking in milk. By getting most of your nutrition from whole plant 
foods, you get a bonus instead of baggage. 
When the National Pork Board promotes ham as an “excellent source of 
protein,”12 I can’t help but think of the famous quote from a McDonald’s senior vice 
president for marketing who, under oath in a court of law, described Coca-Cola as 
nutritious because it is “providing water.”13 
Why Don’t the Dietary Guidelines Just Say No? 
The green-light message shines brightly in pronouncements telling you to “eat more 
fruits and vegetables,” but the yellow and red lights can be dim and cloudy thanks to 
politics. In other words, the guidelines are clear when there is eat-more messaging 
(“Eat more fresh produce”), but eat-less messaging is obscured into biochemical 
components (“Eat less saturated and trans fatty acids”). National health authorities 
rarely just say to “eat less meat and dairy.” That’s why my green-light message will 
sound familiar to you (“Oh, ‘eat fruits and veggies’—I’ve heard that before”) but the 
yellow- and red-light messages may sound controversial (“What? Minimize meat? 
Really?”). 
Part of the USDA’s mission is “expanding markets for agricultural products.”14 At 
the same time, the federal agency is tasked with protecting public health by helping to 
develop the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. That’s why, when those two 
directives are in sync, their eat-more language is clear: “Increase fruit intake.” 
“Increase vegetable intake.”15 But when their dual mandates are in conflict—when 
“improving nutrition and health” is at odds with promoting “agriculture 
production”16—the eat-less messaging of the Dietary Guidelines gets repackaged and 
ends up referring to biochemical components: “Reduce intake of solid fats (major 
sources of saturated and trans fatty acids).” 
What’s the average consumer supposed to do with that obscure little nugget? 
When the Guidelines tell you to eat less added sugar, calories, cholesterol, 
saturated fat, sodium, and trans fat, that’s code for eat less junk food, less meat, less 
dairy, fewer eggs, and fewer processed foods. But they can’t actually say that. When 
they did in the past, all heck broke loose. For example, when a USDA employee 
newsletter even suggested trying a meat-free lunch once a week as part of Johns 
Hopkins University’s School of Public Health “Meatless Mondays” initiative,17 the 
resulting political firestorm from the meat industry led the USDA to retract the advice 
just hours later.18 “As a result of these conflicts [of interest],” concluded an analysis 
in the Food and Drug Law Journal, “the Guidelines sometimes favor the interests of 
the food and drug industries over the public’s interest in accurate and impartial 
dietary advice.”19 
This reminds me of the landmark report on trans fat from the National Academy of 
Sciences’ Institute of Medicine, one of our most prestigious institutions.20 They 
concluded that no amount of trans fat is safe “because any incremental increase in 
trans fatty acid intake increases C[oronary] H[eart] D[isease] risk.”21 Since trans fats 
are found naturally in meat and dairy products,22 this placed them in a quandary: 
“Because trans fats are unavoidable in ordinary, nonvegan diets, consuming 0 percent 
of energy would require significant changes in patterns of dietary intake.”23 
So if trans fats are found in meat and dairy and the only safe intake of trans fats is 
zero, that means the Institute of Medicine went on to encourage everyone to start 
eating a plant-based diet, right? No, they did not. The director of Harvard’s 
Cardiovascular Epidemiology Program famously explained why: “We can’t tell 
people to stop eating all meat and all dairy products,” he said. “Well, we could tell 
people to become vegetarians,” he added. “If we were truly basing this only on 
science, we would, but it is a bit extreme.”24 
We certainly wouldn’t want scientists to base anything on science! 
How SAD Is the Standard American Diet? 
As cynical as I’ve become about diet and nutrition in this country, I was still 
surprised by a 2010 report from the National Cancer Institute on the status of the 
American diet. For example, three out of four Americans don’t eat a single piece of 
fruit in a given day, and nearly nine out of ten don’t reach the minimum recommended 
daily intake of vegetables. On a weekly basis, 96 percent of Americans don’t reach 
the minimum for greens or beans (three servings a week for adults), 98 percent don’t 
reach the minimum for orange vegetables (two servings a week), and 99 percent 
don’t reach the minimum for whole grains (about three to four ounces a day).25 
Then there was the junk food. The federal guidelines were so lax that up to 25 
percent of your diet could be made up of “discretionary calories,” meaning junk. A 
quarter of your calories could come from cotton candy washed down with Mountain 
Dew, and you’d still be within the guidelines. Yet we failed. Astoundingly, 95 
percent of Americans exceeded their discretionary calorie allowance. Only one in a 
thousand American children between the ages of two and eight made the cutoff, 
consuming less than the equivalent of about a dozen spoonfuls of sugar a day.26 
And we wonder why there is an obesity epidemic? 
“In conclusion,” the researchers wrote, “nearly the entire U.S. population 
consumes a diet that is not on par with recommendations. These findings add another 
piece to the rather disturbing picture that is emerging of a nation’s diet in crisis.”27 
Producers of unhealthy commodities aren’t out to make you sick. They’re just 
trying to make a buck. Coca-Cola’s profit margin, for example, is about one quarter 
of the soda’s retail price, making soft-drink production, alongside tobacco, among the 
most profitable industries.28 What’s harder to understand is why the public health 
community isn’t doing more about it. 
“When the history of the world’s attempt to address obesity is written,” wrote the 
head of Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity, “the greatest 
failure may be collaboration with and appeasement of the food industry.”29 For 
instance, Susan G. Komen, a leading U.S. breast cancer charity, linked up with fast- 
food giant KFC to sell pink buckets of fried chicken.30 
Save the Children used to be a leader in the push for taxes on soda to offset some 
of the costs of childhood obesity. Then the organization did an abrupt 180-degree 
turn, withdrawing its support, saying that such campaigns no longer “fit with the way 
that Save the Children works.” Perhaps it is only a coincidence that it was seeking a 
grant from Coca-Cola and had already accepted a $5 million grant from Pepsi.31 
Even though our eating habits are now killing more Americans than our smoking 
habits,32 I often hear the refrain in public health circles that we have to work with, 
rather than against, these companies, because unlike with tobacco, we don’t have to 
smoke, but we do have to eat.33 Well, yes, we need to breathe—but we don’t need to 
breathe smoke. And yes, we need to eat, but we don’t need to eat junk. 
How I Define “Processed” 
My Traffic Light model stresses two important general concepts: Plant foods, with 
their greater protective nutritional factors and fewer disease-promoting ones, are 
healthier than animal foods, and unprocessed foods are healthier than processed 
foods. Is that always true? No. Am I saying that all plant foods are better than all 
animal foods? No. In fact, one of the worst items on store shelves is partially 
hydrogenated vegetable shortening—a product that has vegetable right in its name! 
Even some unprocessed plants—such as blue-green algae—can be toxic.34 Anyone 
who’s had a bad case of poison ivy knows plants don’t always like to be messed 
with. In general, though, choose plant foods over animal foods, and unprocessed over 
processed. Michael Pollan, bestselling author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, has said, 
“If it came from a plant, eat it. If it was made in a plant, don’t.”35 
What do I mean by processed? The classic example is the milling of grains from 
whole wheat to white flour. Isn’t it ironic that these are called “refined” grains, a 
word meaning improved or made more elegant? The elegance was not felt by the 
millions who died in the nineteenth century from beriberi, a vitamin B–deficiency 
disease that resulted from polishing rice from brown to white.36 (White rice is now 
fortified with vitamins to compensate for the “refinement.”) A Nobel Prize was 
awarded for the discovery of the cause of beriberi and its cure—rice bran, the brown 
part of rice that was removed. Beriberi can cause damage to the heart muscle, 
resulting in death from heart failure. Surely such a thing could never happen in 
modern times—an epidemic of heart disease that could be prevented and cured with 
a change in diet? Come on. (Please reread chapter 1.) 
Sometimes, however, processing can make foods healthier. For example, tomato 
juice appears to be the one common juice that may actually be healthier than the 
whole fruit. The processing of tomato products boosts the availability of the 
antioxidant red pigment lycopene by as much as fivefold.37 Similarly, the removal of 
fat from cacao beans to make cocoa powder improves the nutritional profile, because 
cocoa butter is one of the rare saturated plant fats (along with coconut and palm 
kernel oils) that can raise your cholesterol.38 
So for the purposes of the Traffic Light model, I like to think of “unprocessed” as 
nothing bad added, nothing good taken away. In the above example, tomato juice 
could be thought of as relatively unprocessed because even much of the fiber is 
retained—unless salt is added, which would make it a processed food in my book 
and bump it right out of the green zone. Similarly, I would consider chocolate—but 
not cocoa powder—processed because sugar is added. 
Using my definition of nothing bad added, nothing good taken away, steel-cut 
oats, rolled oats, and even (plain) instant oatmeal can all be considered unprocessed. 
Almonds are obviously a whole plant food. I would also consider no-salt-added 
almond butter to be a green-light food, but even unsweetened almond milk is a 
processed food, a food from which nutrition has been stolen. Am I saying almond 
milk is bad for you? Foods are not so much good or bad as they are better or worse. 
All I’m saying is that unprocessed foods tend to be healthier than processed ones. 
Think of it this way: Eating almonds is healthier than drinking almond milk. 
The limited role I see for yellow-light foods in a healthy diet is to promote the 
consumption of green-light foods. For instance, if the only way I can get patients to 
eat oatmeal in the morning is if they make it creamy with almond milk, then I tell them 
to go right ahead. The same could be said for red-light foods. Without hot sauce, my 
intake of dark-green, leafy vegetables would plummet. Yes, I know there are all sorts 
of sodium-free, exotically flavored vinegars out there that I could use, and maybe one 
day I’ll wean myself off Tabasco. But given my current tastes, the green ends justify 
the red means. If the only way you’re going to eat a big salad is to sprinkle Bac-Os 
on top, then sprinkle away. 
Bac-Os are what are referred to as ultraprocessed foods, bearing no redeeming 
nutritional qualities or resemblance to anything that grew out of the ground and often 
containing added garbage. Bac-Os, for example, have added trans fats, salt, sugar, 
and Red 40, a food dye banned in a number of European countries.39 As a red-light 
food, it ideally should be avoided, but if the alternative to your big spinach salad 
with Bac-Os is KFC, then it’s better to have the salad with the Bac-Os. They can be 
the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down. The same goes for real bacon 
bits, for that matter. 
I realize some people have religious or ethical objections to even trivial amounts 
of animal products. (Growing up Jewish near the largest pig factory west of the 
Mississippi, I can relate to both sentiments.) But from a human health standpoint, 
when it comes to animal products and processed foods, it’s the overall diet that 
matters. 
What Does “Whole-Food, Plant-Based” Mean, Exactly? 
Sometimes people’s diets take on a religiosity of their own. I remember a man once 
telling me that he could never “go plant based” because he could never give up his 
grandma’s chicken soup. Huh? Then don’t! After I asked him to say hello to his 
bubby for me, I told him that enjoying her soup shouldn’t keep him from making 
healthier choices the rest of the time. The problem with all-or-nothing thinking is that 
it keeps people from even taking the first steps. The thought of never having 
pepperoni pizza again somehow turns into an excuse to keep ordering it every week. 
Why not scale down to once a month or reserve it for special occasions? We cannot 
let the “perfect” be the enemy of the good. 
It’s really the day-to-day stuff that matters most. What you eat on special 
occasions is insignificant compared to what you eat day in and day out. So don’t beat 
yourself up if you really want to put edible bacon-flavored candles on your birthday 
cake. (I’m not making those up!40) Your body has a remarkable ability to recover 
from sporadic insults as long as you’re not habitually poking it with a fork. 
*   *   * 
This book is not about vegetarianism, veganism, or any other “-ism.” There are 
people who completely eliminate any and all animal products as part of a religious 
or moral stance and may indeed end up better off as a side benefit.41 But strictly from 
a human health standpoint, you would be hard pressed to argue, for example, that the 
traditional Okinawan diet, which is 96 percent plant based,42 is inferior to a typical 
Western, 100 percent vegan diet. In Kaiser Permanente’s guide “The Plant-Based 
Diet: A Healthier Way to Eat,” the authors define a plant-based diet as one that 
excludes animal products completely, but they make sure to note: “If you find you 
cannot do a plant-based diet 100 percent of the time, then aim for 80 percent. Any 
movement toward more plants and fewer animal products can improve your 
health!”43 
From a nutrition standpoint, the reason I don’t like the terms vegetarian and 
vegan is that they are only defined by what you don’t eat. When I used to speak on 
college campuses, I would meet vegans who appeared to be living off french fries 
and beer. Vegan, technically, but not exactly health promoting. That’s why I prefer the 
term whole-food, plant-based nutrition. As far as I can discern, the best available 
balance of evidence suggests that the healthiest diet is one centered on unprocessed 
plant foods. On a day-to-day basis, the more whole plant foods and the fewer 
processed and animal products, the better.44 
Preparing Yourself for Healthier Habits 
First, you need to know your own psychology. There are certain personality types 
that do better when they go all in. If you tend to have an “addictive” personality, or if 
you are the kind of person who takes things to extremes—for instance, you either 
don’t drink at all or you drink in excess—it’s probably best for you to try to stick 
with the program. But some individuals can get away with “social smoking,” for 
example; they can light up a few times a year and escape nicotine dependence.45 The 
reason we as physicians advocate for smokers to quit completely is not because we 
think that one cigarette every once in a while is going to do irreversible damage but 
because we’re afraid that one cigarette may lead to two, and, before long, the 
unhealthy habit has taken hold. Similarly, one (well-cooked) hamburger is not going 
to kill anyone. It’s what you eat day to day that adds up. You have to take stock of 
your disposition to know if you can overcome the risk of sliding down the slippery 
slope. 
There’s a concept in psychology called “decision fatigue” that marketers use to 
exploit consumers. It appears humans have a limited capacity to make many decisions 
in one short stretch of time, and the quality of our decisions will deteriorate to the 
extent that we eventually begin making downright irrational choices. Ever wonder 
why supermarkets stack the junk food at the checkout counter? After wading through 
the forty thousand items in the average supermarket,46 we end up with less willpower 
to resist impulse purchases.47 So making rules for yourself and sticking to them may 
help you make more sensible choices over the long run. For instance, making a strict 
decision to never cook with oil, to avoid meat entirely, or to eat only whole grains 
may paradoxically make for sturdier life changes. By not having junk food in the 
house, you remove the temptation by removing the choice. I know if I get hungry 
enough I’ll eat an apple. 
There may also be a physiological argument for not wildly deviating from a well- 
planned diet. After a vacation cruise during which you indulged in all manner of rich 
foods, your palate may get dulled to the point where the natural foods you enjoyed 
just the week before no longer deliver the same taste satisfaction. For some, this may 
simply require a period of readjustment. But for others, this departure from an 
otherwise healthy diet may lead back to a dietary glut involving added salt, sugar, 
and fat. 
*   *   * 
For those of us who grew up eating SAD (the Standard American Diet), starting to 
eat healthfully can be a big shift. I know it was for me. Though my mom tried to keep 
us eating good-for-us foods at home, when I was hanging out with friends, we’d go 
through boxes of Little Debbie snack cakes and indulge in greasy meals at the local 
Chinese restaurant, where I’d order spareribs or any other dish with chunks of deep- 
fried meat. One of my favorite snacks was nacho cheese–flavored Slim Jims. 
Thankfully, I was able to escape SAD’s clutches before any overt health problems 
arose. That was twenty-five years ago. Looking back, I view that as one of the best 
decisions of my life. 
Some go cold turkey, if you will, while others transition more slowly using a 
variety of approaches. One I’ve used personally in my medical practice is Kaiser 
Permanente’s three-step method. Realizing that most American families tend to rotate 
through the same eight or nine meals, step one suggests that you think of three meals 
you already enjoy that are plant based, like pasta and marinara sauce that could be 
easily tweaked to whole-grain pasta with some added veggies. Step two asks you to 
think of three meals you already eat that could be adapted to become a green-light 
meal, like switching from beef chili to five-bean chili. Step three is my favorite: 
Discover new healthy options.48 
Ironically, many people following healthy diets report eating an even greater 
variety of foods than when they ate their former “unrestricted” diet. Before 
widespread use of the Internet, I used to tell people to go to their public libraries and 
borrow cookbooks. Today, Google whole-food, plant-based recipes, and a million 
hits pop up. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, good places to start include: 
• ForksOverKnives.com: This site of the wildly popular documentary and 
book of the same name offers hundreds of recipes. 
• StraightUpFood.com: Cooking instructor Cathy Fisher shares more than 
one hundred recipes on this site. 
• HappyHealthyLongLife.com: This site’s tagline reads: “A [Cleveland 
Clinic] medical librarian’s adventures in evidence-based living.” She used 
the e word—I think I’m in love! 
Once you’ve found three new meals you enjoy and can prepare with ease, step 
three is complete. You now have a nine-meal rotation, and you’re off! After that, 
moving on to breakfast and lunch is easy. 
If you hate to cook and just want the cheapest, easiest way to make healthy meals, 
I highly recommend dietitian Jeff Novick’s Fast Food DVD series. Using common 
staples like canned beans, frozen vegetables, quick-cook whole grains, and spice 
mixes, Jeff shows you how you can feed your family healthfully in no time for about 
four dollars a day per person. The DVDs also include grocery store walk-throughs, 
shopping tips, and information on how to decipher nutrition labels. Check out his

If you crave more structure and social support, the Physicians Committee for 
Responsible Medicine (PCRM), a nonprofit nutrition research and policy advocacy 
organization in Washington, D.C., has a fantastic three-week kick-start program for 
plant-based eating. Check it out at 21DayKickstart.org. This free online nutrition 
program starts the first of every month and offers a full meal plan, recipes, tips, 
resources, a restaurant guide, and a community forum. As of this writing, it’s offered 
in four languages. Hundreds of thousands of people have already benefited from it, so 
feel free to give it a try.

I’ve always tried to get my patients to think of healthy eating as an experiment. It can 
be overwhelming to think of such a sweeping change as permanent. That’s why I ask 
them to give me just three weeks. I find that if my patients think of it simply as an 
experiment, they’re more likely to go whole hog (whole grain?) and realize the 
maximum benefits. But that’s just me being sneaky. I know that once those three 
weeks are up, if they really gave it their all, they will be feeling so much better, their 
lab values will be looking so much better, and their palates will have started to 
change. Healthy eating tastes better and better the longer you stick with it. 
I remember talking about this with Dr. Neal Barnard, founding president of 
PCRM, which publishes a great deal of research pitting a healthy diet against a 
variety of common ailments—everything from acne and arthritis to menstrual cramps 
and migraines. He often uses what’s called an “A-B-A” study design. Participants’ 
health is assessed at baseline on their regular diets, and then they’re switched to a 
therapeutic diet. In an effort to make sure any health changes participants experience 
on the new diet aren’t merely a coincidence, they are then switched back to their 
regular diet to see if the changes disappear. 
This kind of rigorous study design improves the validity of the results, but the 
problem, Dr. Barnard related, is that sometimes people improve too much. After a 
few weeks on a plant-based diet, sometimes people feel so much better that they 
refuse to go back on their baseline diet49—even though it’s required by the study 
protocol. Since they didn’t complete the study as planned, their data have to be 
effectively thrown out and may never make it into the final paper. Ironically, healthy 
eating can be so effective that it undermines its own studies of effectiveness! 
WWDGE: What Would Dr. Greger Eat? 
I’m regularly asked what I eat every day. I’ve always been hesitant to answer for a 
number of reasons. First, it shouldn’t matter what I or anyone else eats, says, or does. 
The science is the science. Too much of the nutrition world is split into camps, each 
following their respective guru. What other field of serious scientific inquiry is like 
that? After all, 2 + 2 = 4 regardless of what your favorite mathematician thinks. This 
is because there isn’t a trillion-dollar industry that profits from confusing people 
about arithmetic. If you were getting conflicting messages from all sides about basic 
math, in desperation, you might have to choose one authority to stick with, hoping that 
person will accurately represent the available research. Who has time to read and 
decipher all the original source material? 
Early on in my practice, I decided that I didn’t want to rely on anyone else’s 
interpretation for what could ultimately be life-or-death decisions for my patients. I 
had the access, the resources, and the background to interpret the science on my own. 
When I initially began my annual reviews of the nutrition literature, it was really just 
to make myself a better doctor. But when I discovered such a treasure trove of 
information, I knew I couldn’t keep it to myself. My hope is to disseminate it in a way 
that removes me as much as possible from the equation. I don’t want to present the 
trademarked Dr. Greger Diet; I want to present the best-available-evidence diet. 
That’s why I show the original papers, charts, graphs, and quotes with links to all the 
primary sources in my NutritionFacts.org videos. I try to keep my own interpretation 
to a minimum—though admittedly, I sometimes can’t help myself! 
What a person chooses to do with information is highly personalized and often 
depends on such factors as his or her current life situation and how risk averse he or 
she is. Given the same information, two people can make two entirely different but 
legitimate decisions. For this reason, I’ve been hesitant to share my own personal 
choices, because I’m afraid they’ll unduly sway people to make decisions that might 
not be right for them. I’d rather just present the science and let others decide for 
themselves. 
In addition, everyone’s taste buds are different. I can imagine someone thinking, 
He puts hot sauce on what? When people hear me talk about the wonders of hummus 
(a Middle Eastern chickpea spread) but not baba ganoush (a Middle Eastern roasted- 
eggplant spread), they might come away with the impression that I think one is 
healthier than the other. This may be (and probably is, actually), but my real reason is 
simple: I don’t like the taste of eggplant. 
Conversely, just because I eat something doesn’t mean it’s healthy. For example, 
people are surprised to hear I use dutched (alkali-processed) cocoa. In that process, 
more than half of the antioxidants and flavanol phytonutrients are wiped out.50 Why 
would I use it, then? Because it tastes so much better to me than unprocessed cocoa. 
While I encourage people to use natural cocoa, I don’t take my own advice in that 
regard. In some cases, it would be better if people would do as I say, not as I do. 
And what if I shared a recipe that someone found utterly repulsive? I would hate 
for him or her to think, If this is healthy eating, count me out! As you eat healthier, 
your palate actually changes. It’s an amazing phenomenon. Your taste buds are 
constantly adapting—minute to minute, in fact. If you drank some orange juice right 
now, it would taste sweet. But if you first ate some candy and then drank the same 
OJ, it could taste unpleasantly bitter. Over the long term, the more you eat healthfully, 
the better healthy foods taste. 
I remember the first time I sipped a green smoothie. I was speaking somewhere in 
Michigan, hosted by a darling physician couple. They told me that they drank 
“blended salads” for breakfast. Intellectually, I loved the idea. Greens, the healthiest 
food on the planet, in convenient liquid form? I envisioned myself drinking a salad on 
my way to work every day. But then I tasted it. It felt like I was drinking someone’s 
lawn. I gagged and almost threw up over my hosts’ kitchen table. 
Green smoothies are something you have to build up to. Everyone loves fruit 
smoothies. A frozen banana, strawberries—yum! And surprisingly, you can throw a 
handful of baby spinach in there and you may hardly even taste it. Give it a try! 
You’ll be surprised. Okay, so if one handful is good, how about two? Slowly, your 
taste buds can adapt to increasing quantities of greens. This happens with all your 
senses. Walk into a dark room, and your eyes will slowly adapt. Stick your foot into 
a hot bath, and though at first it may be too hot, your body equilibrates to a new 
normal. Likewise, in just a couple of weeks, you can be drinking—and enjoying— 
concoctions you’d now consider absolutely wretched. 
Having said all that, I will now proceed to tell you what I eat, what I drink, what I 
do, and how I do it. In each subsequent chapter, I will dive deeper into each of the 
entries on my Daily Dozen checklist to describe which types of these green-light 
foods are my favorites, as well as the tricks and techniques I use to prepare them. I 
will not be detailing every type of bean, fruit, vegetable, nut, or spice that I eat. 
Rather, my goal here is to explore some of the interesting science behind a few of my 
favorite options in each category. 
Please understand that my strategy is a way to do it rather than the way to do it. If 
it happens to work for you too, great. If not, I hope you’ll explore the myriad other 
ways you could use this same body of evidence to help improve and prolong your 
life. 
 Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen 
Whole-food, plant-based nutrition—pretty self-explanatory, right? But aren’t some 
green-light foods better than others? For example, you can apparently live extended 
periods eating practically nothing but potatoes.1 That would, by definition, be a 
whole-food, plant-based diet—but not a very healthy one. All plant foods are not 
created equal. 
The more I’ve researched over the years, the more I’ve come to realize that 
healthy foods are not necessary interchangeable. Some foods and food groups have 
special nutrients not found in abundance elsewhere. For example, sulforaphane, the 
amazing liver-enzyme detox-boosting compound I profiled in chapters 9 and 11, is 
derived nearly exclusively from cruciferous vegetables. You could eat tons of other 
kinds of greens and vegetables on a given day and get no appreciable sulforaphane if 
you didn’t eat something cruciferous. It’s the same with flaxseeds and the anticancer 
lignan compounds. As I mentioned in chapters 11 and 13, flax may average one 
hundred times more lignans than other foods. And mushrooms aren’t even plants at 
all; they belong to an entirely different biological classification and may contain 
nutrients (like ergothioneine) not made anywhere in the plant kingdom.2 (So 
technically, maybe I should be referring to a whole-food, plant- and fungus-based 
diet, but that just sounds kind of gross.) 
It seems like every time I come home from the medical library buzzing with some 
exciting new data, my family rolls their eyes, sighs, and asks, “What can’t we eat 
now?” Or they’ll say, “Wait a second. Why does everything seem to have parsley in 
it all of a sudden?” My poor family. They’ve been very tolerant. 
As the list of foods I tried to fit into my daily diet grew, I made a checklist and 
had it on a little dry-erase board on the fridge. We would make a game out of ticking 
off the boxes. This evolved into the Daily Dozen (see figure 6). 
Figure 6 
B y beans, I mean legumes, which comprise all the different kinds of beans, 
including soybeans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils. While eating a bowl of pea 
soup or dipping carrots into hummus may not seem like eating beans, it is. You 
should try to get three servings a day. A serving is defined as a quarter cup of 
hummus or bean dip; a half cup of cooked beans, split peas, lentils, tofu, or tempeh; 
or a full cup of fresh peas or sprouted lentils. Though peanuts are technically 
legumes, nutritionally, I’ve grouped them in the Nuts category, just as I would 
consider green (snap or string) beans to be better placed in the Other Vegetables 
category. 
A serving of berries is a half cup of fresh or frozen, or a quarter cup of dried. 
While biologically speaking, avocados, bananas, and even watermelons are 
technically berries, I’m using the colloquial term for any small edible fruit, which is 
why I include kumquats and grapes (and raisins) in this category, as well as fruits that 
are typically thought of as berries but aren’t technically, such as blackberries, 
cherries, mulberries, raspberries, and strawberries. 
For other fruits, a serving is a medium-sized fruit, a cup of cut-up fruit, or a 
quarter cup of dried fruit. Again, I’m using the colloquial rather than the botanical 
definition, so I place tomatoes in the Other Vegetables group. (Interestingly, this is 
something the U.S. Supreme Court actually ruled on in 1893.3 Arkansas decided to 
have it both ways, declaring tomatoes both the official state fruit and the official state 
vegetable.4) 
Common cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cabbage, collards, and kale. I 
recommend at least one serving a day (typically a half cup) and at least two 
additional servings of greens a day, cruciferous or otherwise. Serving sizes for other 
greens and vegetables are a cup for raw leafy vegetables, a half cup for other raw or 
cooked vegetables, and a quarter cup for dried mushrooms. 
Everyone should try to incorporate one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds into his or 
her daily diet, in addition to a serving of nuts or other seeds. A quarter cup of nuts is 
considered a serving, or two tablespoons of nut or seed butters, including peanut 
butter. (Chestnuts and coconuts don’t nutritionally count as nuts.) 
I also recommend one-quarter teaspoon a day of the spice turmeric, along with 
any other (salt-free) herbs and spices you may enjoy. 
A serving of whole grains can be considered a half cup of hot cereal such as 
oatmeal, cooked grain such as rice (including the “pseudograins” amaranth, 
buckwheat, and quinoa), cooked pasta, or corn kernels; a cup of ready-to-eat (cold) 
cereal; one tortilla or slice of bread; half a bagel or english muffin; or three cups of 
popped popcorn. 
The serving size in the beverage category is one glass (twelve ounces), and the 
recommended five glasses a day is in addition to the water you get naturally from the 
foods in your diet. 
Finally, I advise one daily “serving” of exercise, which can be split up over the 
day. I recommend ninety minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk (four 
miles per hour) walking or forty minutes of vigorous activity (such as jogging or 
active sports) each day. Why so much? I’ll explain my reasoning in the Exercise 
chapter. 
This may all sound like a lot of boxes to check, but it’s not difficult to knock off a 
bunch at one time. One simple peanut butter and banana sandwich and you just 
checked off four boxes. Or imagine sitting down to a big salad. Two cups of spinach, 
a handful of arugula, a handful of toasted walnuts, a half cup of chickpeas, a half cup 
of red bell pepper, and a small tomato. You just knocked out seven boxes in one dish. 
Sprinkle on your flax, add a handful of goji berries, and enjoy it with a glass of water 
and fruit for dessert, and you could wipe out nearly half your daily check boxes in a 
single meal. And then if you ate it on a treadmill … just kidding! 
Do I check off each glass of water I drink? No. In fact, I don’t even use the 
checklist anymore; I just used it initially as a tool to get me into a routine. Whenever I 
was sitting down to a meal, I would ask myself, Could I add greens to this? Could I 
add beans to that? (I always have an open can of beans in the fridge.) Can I sprinkle 
on some flax or pumpkin seeds, or maybe some dried fruit? The checklist just got 
me into the habit of thinking, How can I make this meal even healthier? 
I also found the checklist helped with grocery shopping. Although I always keep 
bags of frozen berries and greens in the freezer, if I’m at the store and want to buy 
fresh produce for the week, it helps me figure out how much kale or blueberries I 
need. 
The checklist also helps me picture what a meal might look like. Looking over the 
checklist, you’ll see there are three servings each of beans, fruits, and whole grains, 
and about twice as many veggies in total than any other food component. Glancing at 
my plate, I can imagine one quarter of it filled with grains, one quarter with legumes, 
and a half plate filled with vegetables, along with maybe a side salad and fruit for 
dessert. I prefer one-bowl meals where everything’s mixed together, but the checklist 
still helps me to visualize. Instead of a big bowl of spaghetti with some veggies and 
lentils on top, I think of a big bowl of vegetables with some pasta and lentils mixed 
in. Instead of a big plate of brown rice with some stir-fried vegetables on top, I 
picture a meal that’s mostly veggies—and oh look! There’s some rice and beans in 
there too. 
But there is no need to be obsessive about the Daily Dozen. On hectic travel days 
when I’ve burned through my snacks and I’m trying to piece together some semblance 
of a healthy meal at the airport food court, sometimes I’m lucky if I even hit a quarter 
of my goals. If you eat poorly on one day, just try to eat better the next. My hope is 
that the checklist will serve you as a helpful reminder to try to eat a variety of the 
healthiest foods every day. 
But should you eat your veggies raw or cooked? Do you need to choose organic 
or is conventional okay? What about GMOs? Gluten? All these questions and more 
will be answered as I go through each of the Daily Dozen in detail in the following 
chapters. 
 Beans 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Beans 
Black beans, black-eyed peas, butter beans, cannellini beans, chickpeas (also known 
as garbanzo beans), edamame, english peas, great northern beans, kidney beans, 
lentils (beluga, french, and red varieties), miso, navy beans, pinto beans, small red 
beans, split peas (yellow or green), and tempeh 
Serving Sizes: 
¼ cup of hummus or bean dip 
½ cup cooked beans, split peas, lentils, tofu, or tempeh 
1 cup of fresh peas or sprouted lentils 
Daily Recommendation: 
3 servings per day 
The federal government’s MyPlate campaign was developed to prompt Americans to 
think about building healthy meals. Most of your plate should be covered with 
vegetables and grains, preferably whole grains, with the rest of the plate split 
between fruits and the protein group. Legumes were given special treatment, 
straddling both the protein and the vegetable groups. They’re loaded with protein, 
iron, and zinc, as you might expect from other protein sources like meat, but legumes 
also contain nutrients that are concentrated in the vegetable kingdom, including fiber, 
folate, and potassium. You get the best of both worlds with beans, all the while 
enjoying foods that are naturally low in saturated fat and sodium and free of 
cholesterol. 
The most comprehensive analysis of diet and cancer ever performed was 
published in 2007 by the American Institute for Cancer Research. Sifting through 
some half a million studies, nine independent research teams from around the globe 
created a landmark scientific consensus report reviewed by twenty-one of the top 
cancer researchers in the world. One of their summary cancer-prevention 
recommendations is to eat whole grains and/or legumes (beans, split peas, chickpeas, 
or lentils) with every meal.1 Not every week or every day. Every meal! 
Having some oatmeal in the morning makes it easy enough to fulfill the whole 
grains recommendation, but legumes? Who eats beans for breakfast? Well, lots of 
people around the world do. A traditional English breakfast includes savory 
combinations of baked beans on toast, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. Japanese 
breakfasts traditionally include miso soup, and many children in India start their days 
with idli, a type of steamed lentil cake. More familiar ways for American palates to 
meet the cancer prevention guidelines might be a whole-grain bagel schmeared with 
hummus. My friend Paul mashes cannellini beans into his oatmeal and swears you 
can’t even see or taste them. Why not? 
Soy 
Soybeans are probably the beans Americans are most comfortable incorporating into 
their breakfasts. Soy milk, for instance, has grown into a billion-dollar business. But 
soy milk and even tofu are processed foods. When it comes to the nutrients you tend 
to associate with legumes—fiber, iron, magnesium, potassium, protein, and zinc— 
about half are lost when soybeans are converted into tofu. However, beans are so 
healthy that you can throw away half the nutrition and still have a really healthy food. 
If you do eat tofu, choose varieties made with calcium (you’ll see it in the ingredients 
list), which can weigh in at a whopping 550 mg of calcium per (3 oz) slice.2 
Even better than tofu, though, would be a whole soy food like tempeh, which is a 
type of fermented soybean patty. If you look closely at tempeh, you can actually see 
all the little soybeans. I don’t usually eat tempeh for breakfast, but I do like to slice it 
thin, dip it into a thick flax “egg” mixture (see here for my recipe), dredge it through 
some rosemary-seasoned whole-grain bread crumbs or coarse blue cornmeal, and 
bake it in my toaster oven at about 400°F until golden brown. Then I dip it in buffalo 
hot sauce for a healthier approximation of the chicken wings I enjoyed in my youth. 
What About GMO Soy? 
A prominent scientific journal recently editorialized that although we are now 
swimming in information about genetically modified crops, much of what we’re 
being told is wrong—from both sides of the debate. “But a lot of this incorrect 
information is sophisticated, backed by legitimate-sounding research and written 
with certitude,” the editorial read, quipping that when it comes to GMOs, a good 
gauge of a statement’s fallacy may be “the conviction with which it is delivered.”3 
Monsanto’s Roundup Ready soybeans are the number-one genetically modified 
crop, engineered to be resistant to the herbicide Roundup (also sold by Monsanto), 
which allows farmers to spray the crops to kill weeds while leaving the soy 
standing.4 
Though much debate continues to swarm around the hypothetical risks of GMO 
crops, the greater concern for human health may be the potential for GMO crops to 
contain elevated pesticide residues.5 This fear was realized in 2014 when high levels 
of Roundup pesticides were reported on GMO soybeans (but not on non-GMO or 
organic soybeans).6 The pesticide levels were considered high compared to 
maximum allowable residue levels at the time, but were they high enough to have 
adverse effects on consumers? 
Anti-GMO activists point to studies showing Roundup may interfere with 
embryonic development and disrupt hormones. These studies were, respectively, on 
sea urchin embryos7 and cells from mouse testicles.8 Blogs scream headlines like 
“Men! Save Your Testicles,” citing articles with concerning names like “Prepubertal 
Exposure to Commercial Formulation of the Herbicide Glyphosate Alters 
Testosterone Levels and Testicular Morphology.” 9 But that study was about puberty 
in rats. I doubt the blog would have gotten as many hits if it had been titled “Men! 
Save Prepubescent Rats’ Testicles!”10 
Am I being too harsh? After all, where could scientists find live human tissue to 
experiment on? A research team came up with a brilliant solution—study placentas! 
Millions of women in the United States give birth each year, and the placenta, the 
temporary organ formed in the uterus to nourish the fetus during pregnancy, is 
typically incinerated after delivery. Why not test Roundup on human placental tissue? 
The researchers did so and found that at the concentration that’s sprayed on crops in 
the fields, the pesticides did indeed have toxic effects on human tissue.11 
That finding may help explain the few tentative studies suggesting adverse effects 
on pesticide workers12,13 and their children,14 but by the time the pesticides enter the 
food supply, they are highly diluted. Concentrations of Roundup pesticides may only 
reach a few parts per million in food and a few parts per billion in your body. 
Researchers, however, discovered the pesticide may still have effects at a few parts 
per trillion. Even at that minuscule dose, Roundup pesticides were found to have 
estrogenic effects in vitro, stimulating the growth of estrogen-receptor-positive 
human breast cancer cells.15 
As we saw in chapter 11, though, soy consumption is associated with lower 
breast cancer risk and improved breast cancer survival. That may be because most 
GMO soy in the United States is used as feed for chickens, pigs, and cattle, whereas 
most of the major soy food manufacturers use non-GMO soy. It could also be because 
the benefits of eating any kind of soy far outweigh the risks. Regardless, why accept 
any risk at all when you can choose organic soy products, which by law exclude 
GMOs? 
The bottom line is that there is no direct human data suggesting any harm from 
eating GMO crops, though such studies haven’t been done (which critics say is 
exactly the point).16 That’s why mandatory labeling on GMO products would be 
helpful, so that public health researchers can track whether or not GMOs are having 
any adverse effects. 
But I believe it is important to put the GMO issue in perspective. As I’ve tried to 
show, there are dietary and lifestyle changes we can make that could eliminate most 
heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and cancer. Millions of lives could be saved. For 
this reason, I’m sympathetic to the biotech industry’s exasperation about GMO 
concerns when we still have people dropping dead from everything else they’re 
eating.17 As one review concluded: “Consumption of genetically modified food 
entails risk of undesirable effects similar to the consumption of traditional food.”18 In 
other words, buying the non-GMO Twinkie isn’t doing your body much good. 
Miso is another fermented whole soy food. This thick paste is commonly mixed 
with hot water to make a delicious soup that’s a staple in Japanese cuisine. If you 
want to give it a try, I suggest white miso, which has a mellower flavor than red 
miso. Making miso soup can be as easy as mixing one tablespoon of miso with two 
cups of hot water and whatever vegetables you prefer. That’s it! 
Because miso may contain probiotic bacteria,19 it’s probably best not to actually 
cook the miso, lest the good bugs be wiped out. When I prepare it, I boil dried 
mushrooms, a pinch of arame seaweed, a few sun-dried tomatoes, and greens in a pot 
and ladle off about a quarter cup of hot broth into a large bowl, add the miso, and 
mash it with a fork until only a thin paste remains. I then pour the rest of the soup into 
the bowl and stir to combine it with the miso. And, because I’m a bit of a hot-sauce 
freak, I add some Sriracha for a little kick. My new favorite addition is freshly 
toasted sesame seeds. I pour out a layer of raw, hulled sesame seeds, put them in the 
toaster oven until they just start to turn golden, and then throw them sizzling into the 
soup. Makes the whole kitchen smell heavenly. 
Miso Soup: Soy Versus Sodium 
The process of producing miso involves adding salt—lots of salt. A single bowl of 
miso soup could contain half the American Heart Association’s recommended daily 
limit, which is why I always reflexively avoided it when I’d see it on a menu. But 
when I actually looked into it, I was surprised by what I found. 
There are two principal reasons to avoid salt: stomach cancer and high blood 
pressure. Considered a “probable cause” of stomach cancer,20 excess salt intake may 
cause thousands of cases every year in the United States.21 The elevated stomach 
cancer risk associated with salt intake appears on par with that of smoking or heavy 
alcohol use but may only be half as bad as opium use22 or a daily serving of meat. A 
study of nearly a half-million people found that a daily portion of meat (about the size 
of a deck of cards) was associated with up to five times the odds of stomach 
cancer.23 
This may explain why people eating plant-based diets appear to be at significantly 
lower risk.24 But it’s not just sodium-rich animal products like processed meats and 
salted fish that are associated with higher stomach cancer risk—pickled plant foods 
are as well.25 Kimchi, a spicy pickled vegetable side dish, is a staple in Korean 
cuisine and could help explain why that country may have the highest stomach cancer 
rates in the world.26 
Miso, however, was not associated with increased cancer risk.27 The 
carcinogenic effects of the salt may be counteracted by the anticarcinogenic effects of 
the soy. For example, tofu intake has been associated with about 50 percent less 
stomach cancer risk28 and salt with about 50 percent more risk,29 which explains how 
they may effectively cancel each other out. Further protection apparently offered by 
allium (onion) family vegetables30 may tip the cancer-fighting scale in favor of miso 
soup that’s garlicky or has some scallions thrown in. 
Cancer isn’t the primary reason people are told to avoid salt, though. What about 
miso soup and high blood pressure? There may be a similar relationship. The salt in 
miso may push up your blood pressure while the soy protein in miso may lower it 
back down.31 For example, if you compare the effects of soy milk to skim milk (to 
make a fairer comparison by removing the saturated butterfat factor), soy milk lowers 
blood pressure about nine times more effectively than skim dairy milk.32 Would the 
benefits of soy be enough to counter the effects of the salt in miso, though? Japanese 
researchers decided to find out. 
Over a four-year period, they tracked men and women in their sixties who started 
out with normal blood pressures to see who was more likely to be diagnosed with 
high blood pressure: those who had two or more bowls of miso soup a day or those 
who had one or less. Two bowls a day would be like adding half a teaspoon of salt 
to your daily diet, yet those who consumed at least that much miso were found to 
have five times lower risk of becoming hypertensive. The researchers concluded: 
“Our results on miso-soup have shown that [the] anti-hypertensive effect of miso is 
possibly above [the] hypertensive effect of salt.”33 So miso soup may actually be 
protective overall. 
Edamame is about as whole a soy food as you can get. After all, these are 
soybeans still in their pods. You can buy them frozen and just throw a handful into 
some boiling water anytime you want a healthy snack. They cook in about five 
minutes. All you need to do is strain them and, if you’re like me, crack lots of fresh 
pepper onto the pods and nibble the beans right out. (You can also buy them pre- 
shelled, but then they’re not as fun to eat.) 
On the opposite end of the processing spectrum are plant-based meat alternatives 
like veggie burgers, which are healthy only insofar as they replace the real thing. 
Beyond Chicken, for example, has fiber, zero saturated fat, zero cholesterol, and 
equal protein to and fewer calories than an actual chicken breast (plus presumably 
less food-poisoning risk). But Beyond Chicken pales in comparison to the nutrition 
found in the soybeans, yellow peas, and amaranth grain from which it was made. Of 
course, people choosing these meat alternatives are not standing in the grocery store 
agonizing between Beyond Chicken Grilled Strips and a bowl of legumes and whole 
grains. So if fajitas are the foregone conclusion, then it would certainly be healthier 
to choose the plant-based mock meat to the meat itself. I see the value of these meat- 
alternative products as healthier transition foods to wean people off the standard 
American diet. Even if you just stopped there, you’d be better off, but the more you 
can move toward whole-food nutrition, the better. You don’t want to get stuck at the 
yellow light. 
Peas 
Like edamame, raw english peas (also known as shell or garden peas) can be a great 
au naturel snack. I fell in love with peas in the pod when I first picked them off the 
vine at a farm my brother and I spent time on one summer as kids. They were like 
candy. Every year, I look forward to the few weeks I can find them fresh. 
Lentils 
Lentils are little lens-shaped legumes. (Lenses were actually named after lentils; lens 
is lentil in Latin.) They gained fame in 1982 upon the discovery of the “lentil effect,” 
or the ability of lentil consumption to blunt the sugar spike of foods consumed hours 
later at a subsequent meal.34 Lentils are so rich in prebiotics that they create a feast 
for your friendly flora, which in turn feed you right back with beneficial compounds, 
such as propionate, that relax your stomach and slow the rate at which sugars are 
absorbed into your system.35 Chickpeas and other legumes were found to have a 
similar influence, and so this phenomenon was later renamed the “second-meal 
effect.”36 
Lentils are already one of the most nutrient-dense legumes. But when sprouted, 
their antioxidant power doubles (and even quintuples for chickpeas).37 Lentils can be 
easily sprouted into one of the healthiest possible snacks. I was amazed when I first 
tried making them. What start out looking like hard little pebbles transform into 
tender morsels in just a couple of days. Why add protein powder to your smoothies 
when you can add sprouted lentils? In a sprouting jar, or simply a mason jar covered 
with cheesecloth secured with a rubber band, soak lentils overnight in water, drain, 
and then rinse and drain twice daily for another couple of days. Sprouting to me is 
like gardening on steroids—I can create fresh produce in three days right on my 
kitchen counter. (Of course, if you open a can of lentils, you can enjoy them in about 
three seconds.) 
Are Canned Beans as Healthy as Home Cooked? 
Canned beans are convenient, but are they as nutritious as home cooked? A recent 
study discovered that indeed canned beans are as healthy as boiled beans—with one 
exception: sodium. Salt is often added to canned beans, resulting in sodium levels up 
to one hundred times more than if you cooked them without any salt.38 Draining and 
rinsing your canned beans can remove about half the added salt, but then you’d also 
be rinsing away some of the nutrition. I recommend purchasing the no-salt-added 
varieties and cooking with the bean liquid in whatever dish you’re whipping up. 
Home-cooked beans may come out tastier, particularly texture-wise. Canned 
beans can sometimes be a bit mushy, whereas when properly soaked and cooked, 
beans can come out nice and firm yet tender. Using dried beans is also cheaper. Some 
bean-counting researchers found that canned beans can be about three times as 
expensive as home cooked, but the difference only came out to about twenty cents per 
serving.39 My family chooses to spend that extra twenty cents to save the hours beans 
can take to cook. 
The only legumes I have the patience to cook from scratch are lentils. They cook 
quickly and don’t need to be presoaked. You can just simmer them as you would 
pasta, in a pot with an abundance of water, for about half an hour. In fact, if you’re 
making pasta and have the time, why not let some lentils boil in the water for twenty 
minutes before adding in the pasta? Lentils are great in spaghetti sauce. That’s what I 
do when I make rice or quinoa: I throw a handful of dried lentils into the rice cooker, 
and they’re done when the grain is cooked. Mashed and seasoned cooked lentils also 
make a great veggie dip. Double check marks! 
Dipping veggies in hummus is a double-check-box snack. And don’t forget other 
bean blending, from garlicky white bean spreads and pinto pâtés to spicy black bean 
dip. Another fantastic snack (can you tell I love snacking?) is roasted chickpeas. 
Google it. My favorite, not surprisingly, is the buffalo ranch flavor (from the Kid 
Tested Firefighter Approved blog40), using a silicone baking mat. 
Mealtime options can include dishes like bean burritos; chili; pasta e fagioli; red 
beans and rice; minestrone; Tuscan white bean stew; and black bean, lentil, or split 
pea soup. My mom turned me on to dehydrated precooked pea soup mixes. (The 
lowest sodium brand I’ve been able to find is from Dr. John McDougall’s food line.) 
You simply add the mix to boiling water with some frozen greens and stir. (Whole 
Foods Market sells inexpensive one-pound frozen bags of a prechopped blend of 
kale, collard, and mustard greens. Couldn’t be easier!) I pack pea soup mix when I 
travel. It’s lightweight, and I can prepare it in the hotel room coffeemaker. 
Big Bucks on Beans’ Benefits 
For more than a decade, soy foods have enjoyed the rare privilege of an “FDA- 
approved” food-label health claim about soy’s ability to protect against heart 
disease. A billion-dollar industry, Big Soy has a lot of money to fund research touting 
the benefits of their bean. But is soy really the top bean, or are other legumes just as 
powerful? It turns out that non-soy beans, including lentils, lima beans, navy beans, 
and pinto beans, drop bad cholesterol levels41 as effectively as soy protein.42 One 
study, for example, found that eating a half a cup a day of cooked pinto beans for two 
months may drop your cholesterol by nineteen points.43 
One of my favorite go-to quickie meals starts with toasting some corn tortillas. 
(Food for Life, the same company that makes Ezekiel bread, makes a sprouted yellow 
corn tortilla usually sold in the frozen section.) Then I mash some canned beans on 
them with a fork and add a spoonful or two of jarred salsa. All the better if I have 
fresh cilantro, salad greens, or avocado to top it all off. If I’m lucky enough to have 
fresh collard greens, I’ll steam a few leaves and use them as burrito wraps to replace 
the tortillas. We call them collardritos in our house. Greens and beans—can’t get 
healthier than that! 
Any leguminous dessert options? Three words: black-bean brownies. I don’t have 
a recipe of my own, but if you poke around online, you’ll find many good ones, 
including the one Dr. Joel Fuhrman shared on The Dr. Oz Show , which uses almond 
butter as the green-light source of fat and dates as the green-light source of sugar.44 
Mostly, I just add beans to whatever I happen to be making. I try to always keep 
an open can front and center in the fridge as a reminder. We buy black beans by the 
case. (Black beans appear to have more phenolic phytonutrients than other common 
legumes,45 but the best bean is probably whichever one you’ll eat the most of!) 
Clearing the Air About Beans and Gas 
Beans, beans. Good for your heart. The more you eat ’em, the … longer you live? 
Legumes have been found to be “the most important predictor of survival in older 
people”46 around the globe. Whether it was the Japanese eating soy products, the 
Swedes eating brown beans and peas, or those in the Mediterranean region eating 
lentils, chickpeas, and white beans, legume intake was consistently associated with a 
longer life span. Researchers found an 8 percent reduction in risk of premature death 
for every twenty-gram increase in daily legume intake—that’s barely two 
tablespoons’ worth!47 
So why aren’t more people taking advantage of this dietary “fountain of youth”? 
Fear of flatulence.48 Is that really the choice you’re left with, then? Breaking wind or 
breaking down? Passing gas or passing on? 
Are the concerns about the gassiness of beans just a bunch of hot air? 
When researchers tried adding a half cup of beans to people’s diets, the majority 
experienced no symptoms at all. Even among people who did get gassy, 70 percent or 
more reported that it diminished by the second or third week of the study. The 
researchers concluded: “People’s concerns about excessive flatulence from eating 
beans may be exaggerated.”49 
Flatulence may be more common than you think. Americans report passing gas an 
average of fourteen times a day,50 with the normal range extending up to twenty-three 
times daily.51 Flatulence comes from two places: swallowed air and fermentation in 
the bowel. Factors that might cause you to swallow extra air include chewing gum, 
wearing ill-fitting dentures, sucking on hard candies, drinking through a straw, eating 
too fast, talking while you eat, and smoking cigarettes. So, if the fear of lung cancer 
doesn’t get you to quit smoking, maybe fear of flatulence will. 
The main source of gas, though, is the normal bacterial fermentation in the colon 
of undigested sugars. Dairy products are a leading cause of excessive flatulence,52 
which is due to poor digestion of the milk sugar lactose.53 One of the most flatulent 
patients ever reported in the medical literature was effectively cured once all dairy 
products were removed from his diet. The case, reported in the New England 
Journal of Medicine and submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records , 
involved a man who, after consuming dairy, experienced “70 passages in one four- 
hour period.”54 Cutting the cheese, indeed. 
Long term, most people bulking up on high-fiber plant foods do not appear to have 
significantly increased problems with gas.55 The buoyancy of floating stools from 
trapped gases can in fact be seen as a sign of adequate fiber intake.56 The indigestible 
sugars in beans that make it down to your colon may even function as prebiotics to 
feed your good bacteria and make for a healthier colon. 
Even if at first they make you gassy, beans are so health promoting that you should 
experiment with ways to keep them in your diet at all costs. Lentils, split peas, and 
canned beans tend to produce less gas, and tofu isn’t usually an offender. Repeated 
soakings of dried beans in water containing a quarter teaspoon of baking soda per 
gallon57 and tossing out the cooking water may help if you boil your own beans. Of 
the spices that have been tested, cloves, cinnamon, and garlic seem to be the most gas 
reducing, followed by turmeric (but only if uncooked), pepper, and ginger.58 If worse 
comes to worst, there are cheap supplements that contain alpha-galactosidase, an 
enzyme shown to break up the bean sugars and take the sail out of your wind.59 
Odor is a separate issue. The smell appears to come primarily from the digestion 
of sulfur-rich foods. So to cut down on the stench, experts have recommended cutting 
back on such foods as meat and eggs.60 (Hydrogen sulfide is called “rotten egg gas” 
for a reason.) This may be why people who eat meat regularly were found to generate 
as much as fifteen times the sulfides as those eating plant-based diets.61 
There are healthy sulfur-rich foods, such as garlic and cauliflower. If you’re 
about to embark on a long trip in a confined space after a big meal of aloo gobi, 
Pepto-Bismol and generic equivalents can act as a windbreaker by binding up the 
sulfur in your gut to eliminate odors. But this should be used only as a short-term 
solution due to the potential for bismuth toxicity with chronic use.62 
Then there are the high-tech solutions, such as carbon-fiber, odor-eating 
underwear (cost: $65), which were put to the test in a series of studies that included 
such gems as “Utilizing gas-tight Mylar pantaloons, the ability of a charcoal-lined 
cushion to absorb sulfur-containing gases instilled at the anus of eight subjects was 
assessed.”63 The name of the charcoal-lined cushion? The “Toot Trapper.” 
The bottom line: Intestinal gas is normal and healthy. No less an expert than 
Hippocrates himself was attributed as saying, “Passing gas is necessary to well- 
being.”64 In a review of degassing drugs and devices, Dr. John Fardy, a chair of 
gastroenterology, wrote: “Perhaps increased tolerance of flatus would be a better 
solution, for we tamper with harmless natural phenomena at our peril.”65 And, yes, 
Dr. Fardy is his real name.

Legume consumption is associated with a slimmer waist and lower blood pressure, 
and randomized trials have shown it can match or beat out calorie cutting for 
slimming tummy fat as well as improving the regulation of blood sugar, insulin 
levels, and cholesterol. Beans are packed with fiber, folate, and phytates, which may 
help reduce the risk of stroke, depression, and colon cancer. The phytoestrogens in 
soy in particular appear to both help prevent breast cancer and improve breast cancer 
survival. No wonder the cancer guidelines suggest you should try to fit beans into 
your meals—and it’s so easy! They can be added to nearly any meal, easily 
incorporated into snack times, or served as the star attraction. The possibilities are 
endless. 
 Berries 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Berries 
Açai berries, barberries, blackberries, blueberries, cherries (sweet or tart), concord 
grapes, cranberries, goji berries, kumquats, mulberries, raspberries (black or red), 
and strawberries 
Serving Sizes: 
½ cup fresh or frozen 
¼ cup dried 
Daily Recommendation: 
1 serving per day 
The case for berries has been made throughout this book. Berries offer potential 
protection against cancer (chapters 4 and 11), a boost to the immune system (chapter 
5), and a guard for the liver (chapter 8) and brain (chapters 3 and 14). An American 
Cancer Society study of nearly one hundred thousand men and women found that 
those who ate the most berries appeared significantly less likely to die of 
cardiovascular disease.1 
Wait a second—tastes great and may help you live longer? Yes. That’s what 
plant-based eating is all about. 
Greens are the healthiest vegetables, and berries are the healthiest fruits—in part 
due to their respective plant pigments. Leaves contain the green pigment chlorophyll, 
which sets off the firestorm of photosynthesis, so greens have to be packed with 
antioxidants to deal with the charged high-energy electrons that are formed. 
(Remember superoxide from chapter 3?) Meanwhile, berries evolved to have bright, 
contrasting colors to attract fruit-eating critters to help disperse their seeds. And the 
same molecular characteristics that give berries such vibrant colors may account for 
some of their antioxidant abilities.2 
Americans eat a lot of pale and beige foods: white bread, white pasta, white 
potatoes, white rice. Colorful foods are often healthier because they contain 
antioxidant pigments, whether it’s the beta-carotene that makes carrots and sweet 
potatoes orange, the lycopene antioxidant pigment that makes tomatoes red, or the 
anthocyanin pigments that make blueberries blue. The colors are the antioxidants. 
That knowledge alone should revolutionize your stroll down the produce aisle. 
Guess which have more antioxidants—red onions or white onions? You don’t 
need to look up the answer. You can see the difference with your own eyes. (Indeed, 
red onions have 76 percent more antioxidant capacity than white, with yellow onions 
in between.3) So, given the choice, why buy another white onion ever again? 
Red cabbage may contain eight times more antioxidants than green cabbage,4 
which is why you’ll never find a green cabbage in my house. 
Pop quiz: Which wipes out more free radicals—pink grapefruit or regular 
grapefruit? Granny Smith or Red Delicious? Iceberg lettuce or romaine? Red grapes 
or green? Yellow corn or white corn? See, you don’t need me to go to the grocery 
store with you. You can make all these calls yourself. 
What about a purple-skinned eggplant or a white-skinned eggplant? Trick 
question! Remember, the pigment is the antioxidant, so the color of the skin doesn’t 
matter if you peel it off. As we learned in chapter 11, that’s why you never want to 
peel apples. It’s for this same reason kumquats may be the healthiest citrus fruit, 
since you can eat them rind and all. 
Shop for the reddest of strawberries, the blackest of blackberries, the most scarlet 
tomato, the darkest green broccoli you can find. The colors are the antiaging, 
anticancer antioxidants. 
Antioxidant content is one of the reasons I’ve singled out berries for special 
treatment. They are second only to herbs and spices as the most antioxidant-packed 
food category. As a group, they average nearly ten times more antioxidants than other 
fruits and vegetables (and exceed fifty times more than animal-based foods).5 
The Antioxidant Power of Berries 
As with other green-light foods, the healthiest variety is the one you’ll eat most often, 
but if you have no particular preference, why not put the berry with the most 
antioxidants in your morning oatmeal? Thanks to a study that compared more than a 
hundred different berries and berry products, we now know which one that is.6 
America’s favorite fruits are apples and bananas, with antioxidant power of about 
60 units and 40 units, respectively. Mangos, the preferred fruit around the world 
outside of the United States, have even more antioxidant punch at around 110 units. 
(It makes sense when you consider how much more colorful they are on the inside.) 
But none of these fruits are a match for berries. Strawberries weigh in at about 310 
units per cup, cranberries at 330, raspberries at 350, blueberries at 380 (though wild 
blueberries may have twice as much7), and blackberries at a whopping 650 units. 
Above even those are exotic types you can pick wild in the Arctic tundra, like red 
whortleberries. (They sound like something from a Dr. Seuss book!) But in terms of 
what you can find readily in the store, it’s blackberries for the win. (I share my 
whole-fruit cocktail recipe for using one of the runners-up, cranberries, here.) I’m 
happy as long as you’re eating a serving of any type of berry every day, but in terms 
of antioxidant content, choosing blackberries over strawberries appears to give you 
twice the bang for your berry.8 
What About All the Sugar in Fruit? 
There are a few popular diets out there that urge people to stop eating fruits because 
their natural sugars (fructose) are thought to contribute to weight gain. The truth is, 
only fructose from added sugars appears to be associated with declining liver 
function,9 high blood pressure, and weight gain.10 How could the fructose in sugar be 
bad but the same fructose in fruit be harmless? Think about the difference between a 
sugar cube and a sugar beet. (Beets are the primary source of sugar in the United 
States.11) In nature, fructose comes prepackaged with the fiber, antioxidants, and 
phytonutrients that appear to nullify adverse fructose effects.12 
Studies show that if you drink a glass of water with three tablespoons of sugar 
(similar to what would be in a can of soda), you’ll have a big spike in your blood 
sugar levels within the first hour. That causes your body to release so much insulin to 
mop up the excess sugar that you actually overshoot and become hypoglycemic by the 
second hour, meaning that your blood sugar drops even lower than it would if you 
were fasting. Your body detects this low blood sugar, thinks you might be in some 
sort of famine situation, and responds by dumping fat into your bloodstream as an 
energy source to keep you alive.13 This excess fat in the blood can then go on to 
cause further problems. (See chapter 6.) 
But what if you eat a cup of blended berries in addition to the sugar? The berries, 
of course, have sugars of their own—an additional tablespoon’s worth—so the blood 
sugar spike should be even worse, right? Actually, no. Study participants who ate 
berries with their cup of sugar water showed no additional blood sugar spike and no 
hypoglycemic dip afterward; their blood sugar levels merely went up and down, and 
there was no surge of fat into the blood.14 
Consuming sugar in fruit form is not only harmless but actually helpful. Eating 
berries can blunt the insulin spike from high-glycemic foods like white bread, for 
example.15 This may be because the fiber in fruit has a gelling effect in your stomach 
and small intestine that slows the release of sugars16 or because of certain 
phytonutrients in fruit that appear to block the absorption of sugar through the gut wall 
and into your bloodstream.17 So eating fructose the way nature intended carries 
benefits rather than risks. 
Low-dose fructose may actually benefit blood sugar control. Eating a piece of 
fruit with each meal could be expected to lower, rather than raise, the blood sugar 
response.18 What about people with type 2 diabetes? Diabetics randomized into a 
group restricted to no more than two daily pieces of fruit had no better blood sugar 
control than those randomized into a group told to eat a minimum of two pieces of 
fruit per day. The researchers concluded that “the intake of fruit should not be 
restricted in patients with type 2 diabetes.”19 
Surely there must be some level of fructose consumption that’s harmful even when 
served in Mother Nature’s green-light form, right? Apparently not. 
Seventeen people were asked to eat twenty servings of fruit per day for months. 
Despite the extraordinarily high fructose content of this fruit-based diet—the sugar 
equivalent of about eight cans of soda a day—the investigators reported beneficial 
outcomes with no overall adverse effects for body weight, blood pressure,20 insulin, 
cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.21 More recently, the research group who 
invented the glycemic index found that feeding subjects a fruit-, vegetable-, and nut- 
based diet that included about twenty servings of fruit per day for a couple of weeks 
had no adverse effects on weight, blood pressure, or triglycerides—all while 
lowering LDL (“bad”) cholesterol by an astounding thirty-eight points.22 
Cholesterol lowering was not the only record broken: Participants were asked to 
eat forty-three servings of vegetables a day in addition to the fruit, the result of which 
was that the researchers recorded the largest-ever bowel movements documented in a 
dietary intervention.23 
Are frozen berries as nutritious as fresh ones? Studies on cherries,24 
raspberries,25 and strawberries26 suggest that most of their nutrition is retained even 
when frozen. I usually opt for frozen berries since they last longer, are available year 
round, and tend to be cheaper. If you looked in our freezer right now, you’d see it’s 
about half frozen greens and half frozen berries. What do I do with those berries? 
Make ice cream, of course. 
The favored dessert in our home is soft-serve “ice cream” made by blending 
frozen fruit. You whip up frozen fruit in a blender, food processor, or juicer, and 
voilà! Instant all-fruit ice cream. You have to taste it to believe it. The simplest 
recipe has one ingredient: frozen bananas. Peel and freeze some ripe bananas (the 
riper, the better—I’m talking brown). Once frozen, throw them in a food processor 
and blend. They transform into a smooth, light, fluffy dessert cheaper, healthier, and 
tastier than anything you might get in a trendy frozen yogurt shop. 
Of course making berry ice cream or at least a berry-banana mix is even 
healthier. My favorite is chocolate. To make it, blend dark, sweet cherries or 
strawberries mixed with a tablespoon of cocoa power, a splash of a milk of your 
choice (more if you want a milkshake), a capful of vanilla extract, and some pitted 
dates. If you didn’t yet get your nuts for the day, you can add some almond butter. 
Either way, you get an instant, decadent, chocolate dessert so nutritious that the more 
you eat, the healthier you are. Let me repeat that: The more you eat, the healthier you 
are. That’s my kind of ice cream! 
Tart Cherries 
Research dating back half a century suggests tart cherries are so anti-inflammatory 
that they can be used to successfully treat a painful type of arthritis called gout.27 
Delicious dietary treatments are much welcomed, as some gout drugs can cost $2,000 
a dose,28 carry no clear-cut distinction between nontoxic, toxic, and lethal doses,29 or 
can cause a rare side effect in which your skin detaches from your body.30 Of course, 
the best way to deal with gout is to try to prevent it in the first place with a more 
plant-based diet.31 
Cherries can reduce the level of inflammation among healthy people too (as 
measured by a drop in C-reactive protein levels),32 so I was excited to find a green- 
light source available year-round—a canned product with only two ingredients: 
cherries and water. I drain off the liquid (which then goes into my hibiscus punch 
recipe here) and mix the cherries in a bowl of cooked oatmeal along with cocoa 
powder and pumpkin seeds. If you sweeten it with date sugar or erythritol (see here), 
it’s like eating chocolate-covered cherries for breakfast. 
A note of caution: For the same reason that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs 
such as aspirin should be avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy, cocoa, 
berries, and other foods high in anti-inflammatory polyphenols should only be eaten 
in moderation in late pregnancy.33 
Goji Berries 
Tart cherries naturally contain melatonin and have been used to improve sleep 
without any side effects.34 Goji berries, however, have the highest concentrations of 
melatonin.35 Gojis have the third-highest antioxidant capacity of any common dried 
fruit—five times more than raisins and second only to dried pomegranate seeds and 
barberries (a fruit commonly found in Middle Eastern markets and spice stores).36 
Gojis also have a specific antioxidant pigment that makes corn yellow—zeaxanthin. 
When eaten, zeaxanthin is shuttled into your retinas (the back of your eyes) and 
appears to protect against macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss.37 
The egg industry boasts about the zeaxanthin content in yolks, but goji berries 
have about fifty times more than eggs.38 A double-blind, randomized, placebo- 
controlled trial found that gojis may even help people already suffering from macular 
degeneration.39 The researchers used milk to improve the absorption of zeaxanthin 
(which, like all carotenoids, is fat soluble), but a healthier way would be to use 
green-light sources of fat, such as nuts and seeds—in other words, goji trail mix! 
Aren’t goji berries expensive, though? In natural foods stores, they can go for 
twenty dollars a pound, but in Asian supermarkets, you can buy them as “Lycium” 
berries, and they’re even cheaper than raisins. So, however you used to eat raisins— 
as a snack, in baked goods, in your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, whatever—I 
recommend you make the switch to gojis. 
Black Currants and Bilberries 
Speaking of berries and eyesight, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial 
of black currants found they can improve the symptoms of computer eye strain 
(known in doctor-speak as “video display terminal work-induced transient refractive 
alteration”).40 What passes for currants in the United States are usually champagne 
grape raisins, not actual black currants, which were banned in the country a century 
ago at the behest of the lumber industry. (The industry feared they might spread a 
plant disease that affects white pines, a tree we hardly harvest anymore, so the ban 
has since been lifted in some states.) Real black currants are currently making a 
comeback, but if—as the researchers suspected—the benefits have to do with the 
anthocyanin pigments, other berries like bilberries, blueberries, or blackberries may 
help as well. Anthocyanin pigments are responsible for many of the intense blue, 
black, purple, and red colors of berries and other fruits and vegetables. The highest 
concentrations are found in aronia berries and elderberries, followed by black 
raspberries, blueberries (especially the smaller “wild” varieties), and blackberries. 
The cheapest source, though, is probably red cabbage.41 
Bilberries gained notoriety during World War II when it was said that pilots in 
the British Royal Air Force “were eating bilberry jam to improve their night 
vision.”42 It turns out this may have been a story concocted to fool the Germans. The 
more likely reason the Brits were able to suddenly target Nazi bombers in the middle 
of the night wasn’t because of bilberries but thanks to a top-secret new invention: 
radar. 
Unfortunately, these anthocyanin pigments take a hit when berries are processed 
into jam. As much as 97 percent of anthocyanins are lost when strawberries are 
turned into strawberry jam.43 Freeze-drying, however, appears to be remarkably 
nutrient preserving.44 I remember trying “astronaut ice cream” as a kid when I visited 
the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum. That’s what freeze-dried strawberries 
taste like to me. They just melt in your mouth. Delicious, nutritious, but expensive. 
Fresh berries, of course, are divine. My family enjoys pick-your-own outings and 
then freezes the abundance. I’ve also been known to lay a sheet under branches of 
mulberry trees that grow in a park by our house and gently knock down a ripe bounty 
with a broom handle. Evidently, nearly all wild “aggregate” berries (meaning berries 
that look like clusters of little balls, like blackberries, raspberries, and mulberries) 
in North America are edible,45 but please be sure you make an ironclad identification 
before foraging.

Berries in all their colorful, sweet, and flavorful glory are protective little 
antioxidant powerhouses. The issue shouldn’t be how you are going to get your one 
minimum daily serving but rather how you are going to pry yourself away from them. 
In your smoothie, as a dessert, on your salad, or just popped right into your mouth— 
they are nature’s candy.

It took years for nearly five hundred researchers from more than three hundred 
institutions in fifty countries to develop the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study. 
Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, it is the largest analysis of risk 
factors for death and disease in history.1 In the United States, the massive study 
determined that the leading cause of both death and disability was the American diet, 
followed by smoking.2 What did they determine to be the worst aspect about our 
diet? Not eating enough fruit.3 
Don’t limit yourself to eating fruit just the way it comes plucked off the tree. 
Although fruit makes for a perfect, quick snack, don’t forget that it can be cooked as 
well. Think baked apples, poached pears, and grilled pineapple. 
If you like drinking your fruit, blending is better than juicing to preserve nutrition. 
Juicing removes more than just fiber. Most of the polyphenol phytonutrients (see 
chapter 3) in fruits and vegetables appear to be bound to the fiber and are only 
liberated for absorption by the friendly flora in your gut. When you merely drink the 
juice, you lose out on the fiber and all the nutrition that was attached to it.4 Even just 
cloudy apple juice, which retains a bit of the fruit fiber, appears to have nearly triple 
the phenolics compared to clear apple juice.5 
Whereas greater consumption of whole fruits has been associated with a lower 
likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, Harvard University researchers found that 
greater juice consumption was associated with higher diabetes risk. So, by choosing 
yellow-light sources of fruit, like juice or jelly, you may not only be missing out on 
nutrients but actively working against your health.6 
An Apple a Day 
Anyone who says they don’t have time to eat healthfully has never met an apple. Talk 
about a convenience food! For those who grew up in a world dominated by Red 
Delicious and Granny Smith, I’m happy to report there are thousands of varieties. 
Health-wise, crab apples (gross!) probably top the charts,7 but taste-wise, my 
personal favorite is Honeycrisp—or any pick-your-own variety I can find locally. If 
you’ve never tried an apple you picked right off a tree, you don’t know what you’re 
missing. Failing that, farmers’ markets can offer good deals on great produce. My 
family buys apples by the half bushel. 
Dates 
My favorite fruit snack in the fall and winter is apple slices with dates, for the 
perfect mix of tart and sweet. Growing up, I never liked dates. They tasted dry and 
kind of waxy. But then I discovered there were soft, plump, moist varieties that didn’t 
taste like the chalky ones that haunted my childhood. Barhi dates, for example, are 
wet and sticky, but when frozen, they acquire the taste and chew of caramel candy. 
Seriously. Paired with my Honeycrisp, it’s like eating a butterscotch-flavored 
caramel apple. 
Locally, you should be able to find decent Medjool dates in Middle Eastern 
grocery stores and many natural foods markets, but for the too-moist-to-be-sold- 
commercially varieties, you’ll probably have to shop online. I have tried dates from 
most of the major online retailers and always go back to ordering from the Date 
People, a small farm in California. I am averse to commercial endorsements, but I’ve 
never tasted consistently better dates from any other source (although Black Sphinx 
dates from Phoenix come close!). Date People’s annual harvest comes in around my 
birthday in October, and I always splurge as a present to myself and get a big box to 
put in our freezer. 
Olives and Olive Oil 
Olives and extra-virgin olive oil are yellow-light foods. Olive consumption should 
be minimized because they’re soaked in brine—a dozen large olives could take up 
nearly half your recommended sodium limit for an entire day. Olive oil is sodium- 
free, but most of its nutrition has been removed. You can think of extra-virgin olive 
oil a little like fruit juice: It has nutrients, but the calories you get are relatively 
empty compared to those from the whole fruit. (Olives are, after all, fruits.) 
Freshly squeezed olive juice already has less nutrition than the whole fruit, but 
then olive-oil producers also throw away the olive wastewater, which contains the 
water-soluble nutrients. As a result, you end up getting just a small fraction of the 
nutrition of the whole fruit by the time extra-virgin olive oil is bottled. Refined olive 
oil (nonvirgin) is even worse. I would classify it, along with other vegetable oils, as 
red-light foods, as they offer such scant nutrition for their heavy caloric loads. One 
tablespoon of oil can contain more than one hundred calories without filling you up. 
(Compare that single tablespoon to the one-hundred-calorie serving sizes of other 
foods here.) 
I think of oil as the table sugar of the fat kingdom. Similar to the way 
manufacturers take healthy foods like beets and throw out all their nutrition to make 
sugar, they take wholesome corn and scorch-earth it down to corn oil. Like sugar, 
corn oil calories may be worse than just empty. In chapter 1, I touched on the 
impairment of artery function that can occur within hours of eating red-light fare like 
fast food and cheesecake. The same detrimental effect happens after the consumption 
of olive oil8 and other oils9 (but not after eating green-light sources of fat like nuts).10 
Even extra-virgin olive oil may impair your arteries’ ability to relax and dilate 
normally.11 So, like any yellow-light food, its use should be curtailed. 
Cooking without oil is surprisingly easy. To keep foods from sticking, you can 
sauté in wine, sherry, broth, vinegar, or just plain water. For baking, I’ve 
successfully used green-light ingredients such as mashed bananas or avocado, soaked 
prunes, and even canned pumpkin to substitute for oil to provide a similar moistness. 
The reduction of yellow-light foods is all about frequency and quantity. If you are 
going to trek outside the green zone, my advice is simple: Make it count. Don’t waste 
precious indulgences on crappy food. I don’t want to sound like a food snob, but if 
you’re going to eat something less than maximally healthy, I say pamper yourself and 
truly relish it. When I eat olives, there’s no way I’m going to eat those waxy black 
abominations in a can. I’m going to slice up some purple kalamatas that actually have 
some flavor. If you’re going to spoil yourself once in a while, I say do it right! 
Mangos 
Mangos are my favorite fruit treat during spring and summer, but you have to know 
where to look to get good ones. Check out Hispanic markets and Indian grocery 
stores. The difference between a mango from Walmart and one from an Indian spice 
store is like the difference between a hard, pale, tasteless, pink tomato and a ripe, 
flavorful, farm-stand heirloom. You should be able to smell the mango at arm’s 
length. 
My favorite way to eat a mango is like sipping a Capri Sun drink pouch. When the 
fruit gets soft and ripe, I roll it between my palms, kneading it with my fingers until it 
becomes essentially liquid pulp in a pouch. Then I nip off the tip with my teeth, gently 
squeeze, and suck the mango right out of its peel. 
Watermelon 
Are some whole fruits better than others? Berries contain the most antioxidants, 
whereas melons wallow down around iceberg lettuce levels. Watermelon seeds, on 
the other hand, have pretty respectable antioxidant levels, so I try to avoid seedless 
varieties. A spoonful of watermelon seeds may have as many antioxidants as a whole 
cup of melon balls.12 Seedless or not, watermelon contains a compound called 
citrulline that can boost the activity of the enzyme responsible for dilating the blood 
vessels in the penis that result in erections. A group of Italian researchers found that 
citrulline supplementation at the level of five servings of red watermelon a day 
improved erection hardness in men with mild erectile dysfunction, allowing for a 68 
percent increase in monthly intercourse frequency.13 Yellow watermelon has four 
times more citrulline,14 though, so just about one wedge a day (one-sixteenth of a 
modest melon) may have the same effect. If this information is new to you, perhaps 
it’s because the advertising budgets of drug companies like Pfizer, which rake in 
billions of dollars each year from the sale of erectile dysfunction drugs, are about a 
thousand times15 that of the entire budget of the National Watermelon Promotion 
Board.16 
Dried Fruit 
I love dried mangos, but they are hard to find without added sugar. I remember 
naïvely asking a friend in the food business why the industry felt the need to sugar-up 
an already sweet fruit. “Added weight,” he explained. Just as poultry processors 
inject salt water into chickens to add water weight, processed food companies often 
use sugar as a cheap way to bulk up products sold by the pound. 
This made me determined to make my own. I bought an inexpensive dehydrator 
from eBay, and I’m so glad I did. Fruit is about 90 percent water, so imagine 
intensifying the flavor of a fresh, ripe mango tenfold. Mind-blowing! Mangos can be 
a messy pain to peel, but once that’s done, I slice them about a centimeter thick and 
sprinkle them with chia seeds before putting them in the dehydrator. If I’m taking 
them on a plane or a hike, I’ll dry them completely. Otherwise, I only wait until just 
the outside is dry. The outer layer, encrusted with chia, gets a crispy texture while the 
core remains moist and ready to burst. It’s the kind of thing I can’t eat while watching 
a movie or reading a book. It tastes so good I just have to stop, close my eyes, and 
savor it. 
I also like drying thin apple slices. I either sprinkle them with cinnamon or rub 
them with freshly grated ginger. They can be just dried until chewy or completely 
dehydrated into crunchy apple chips. Eating a dozen dried apple rings a day may 
drop LDL cholesterol levels 16 percent within three months and 24 percent within 
six months.17 
If you buy dried fruit, I recommend choosing unsulfured varieties. Sulfur- 
containing preservatives, such as sulfur dioxide in dried fruit and sulfites in wine, 
can form hydrogen sulfide in your gut—this is the rotten egg gas implicated in the 
development of the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis. The main source 
of hydrogen sulfide is the metabolism of animal protein,18 but you can further lower 
your exposure by avoiding sulfur additives (either by reading labels or choosing 
organic, in which such preservatives are forbidden). The sulfur naturally contained in 
cruciferous vegetables does not appear to elevate colitis risk,19 so feel free to add 
kale chips to your healthy snacking menu. 
Prescribing Kiwifruit 
There appear to be a disproportionate number of articles in the medical literature 
about the clinical benefits of kiwifruit. Is that because they’re better than other fruits? 
Or is it because the kiwi industry has more research dollars? One country, New 
Zealand, holds a substantial share of the global kiwi market, so it’s in its best interest 
to underwrite research on the fruit. As a result, there is no shortage of papers touting 
the benefits of kiwifruit. 
Kiwi is one of the fruits I’ve prescribed to my patients with insomnia (two an 
hour before bedtime appears to significantly improve sleep onset, duration, and 
efficiency)20 and also to help with constipation-type irritable bowel syndrome (two 
kiwifruit a day seem to significantly improve bowel function). Kiwi certainly seems 
like a better option than the leading IBS drug, which was pulled from the market for 
apparently killing too many people.21 
Kiwifruit also appear to benefit immune function. Preschoolers randomized to eat 
gold kiwifruits every day appeared to cut their risk of contracting a cold or flu-like 
illness nearly in half compared to those randomly selected to eat bananas instead.22 A 
similar experiment was tried on elderly individuals, another high-risk group. Those 
in the banana control group who got an upper-respiratory-tract infection suffered for 
about five days with a sore throat and congestion, compared to the kiwifruit eaters, 
who felt better after just a day or two.23 About 1 in 130 children may be allergic to 
kiwifruit, though,24 which may rank kiwis as the third-most-common food allergen 
(second only to milk and eggs),25 so they are not for everyone. 
Citrus 
Adding citrus zest to your meals not only adds color, flavor, aroma, and a bit of 
culinary flair but also nutrition. Citrus zest lives up to its name in terms of enlivening 
dishes, and it may do the same to your DNA-repair capabilities. On average, humans 
appear to suffer eight hundred hits to their DNA per hour. If not fixed, this can cause 
mutations that give rise to cancer.26 Comparing identical and fraternal twins, 
researchers have determined that only part of your DNA-repair function is 
determined genetically. The rest may be under your control.27 
The dietary factor found best able to boost DNA repair was citrus fruit.28 Within 
two hours of consuming citrus, your DNA becomes significantly more resistant to 
damage,29 which may help explain why citrus consumption is associated with lower 
risk of breast cancer.30 Some of the citrus compounds thought responsible—which 
concentrate in the breast31 and enhance DNA repair32—are found in the peel, though. 
This may be why people who eat at least some citrus peel appear to have lower skin 
cancer rates than those who don’t.33 
Stick with the whole fruit, because supplements don’t appear to boost DNA 
repair,34 and citrus juice doesn’t appear to help, either. In fact, drinking orange juice 
every morning may even increase skin cancer risk.35 Green-light forms of foods 
always seem to be the best, and you can eat citrus in an even less processed way by 
slipping some of the rind into your diet through zesting. I like to freeze lemons, limes, 
and oranges whole so we always have them on hand to grate onto meals that could 
use a little zing. 
My only whole-citrus caveat: Inform your physician if you eat grapefruit. This 
fruit can suppress the enzymes that help clear more than half of commonly prescribed 
drugs, and less drug clearance means higher drug levels in the body.36 This may 
actually be good if you want a better caffeine buzz from your morning coffee37 or if 
your doctor wants to help you save money by boosting the effects of expensive drugs 
instead of just peeing them away.38 But higher drug levels may also mean higher risk 
of side effects, so if you regularly eat grapefruits, your physician may want to change 
your prescription or alter the dosing. 
Exotic Fruits 
The medical school I attended sits in the middle of Boston’s Chinatown. I remember 
the first time I perused the produce aisle at a large Asian supermarket. With options 
from bizarre-looking dragon fruit to tribble-like rambutans, I felt like I was on 
another planet. Every week I tried something new. Some stuck with me—I still sneak 
lychees into the movies—but others were onetime affairs. Let me share with you the 
Durian Incident. 
Durians are the most badass of all fruits. Imagine a five-pound football covered in 
sharp spikes like some medieval mace. What other fruit could be described in the 
medical literature as causing “severe body injury” in papers with titles like 
“Penetrating Ocular Injury by Durian Fruit”?39 And I haven’t even gotten to its most 
distinctive quality: its smell. With an odor perhaps best described as “pig-shit, 
turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock,”40 durian fruits are banned from 
many public spaces, like subways and airports, in Southeast Asia, where they are 
grown. 
I had to try eating one of these crazy things! 
Durian fruits are sold frozen. (I would soon come to understand why.) I took one 
back to campus and managed to hack off a piece without impaling myself on a spike. 
The fruit tasted like a caramelized onion popsicle. I left the rest in my locker. Big 
mistake! I arrived the next day to find an entire floor of the medical center—including 
the dean’s office—cordoned off. They were going locker to locker, cutting off all the 
locks, searching in vain for the cause of a stench so overpowering you couldn’t even 
locate it. It was like a fog of stink. Hospital staff seriously thought someone had 
stolen body parts from the gross anatomy cadaver lab. And then it struck me. Uh-oh. 
The durian had thawed. When I realized it was all my fault, I crawled to the dean to 
beg forgiveness. I already had a history of run-ins with the administration over issues 
I had raised about the curriculum, and now this. I’ll never forget what he said to me 
that day: “Why am I not surprised you had something to do with this?” 
*   *   * 
When adding as much fruit as possible to your diet, you certainly don’t have to seek 
out weapons-grade stinky fruit, but you also don’t have to stick with the same old, 
same old. Treat yourself! Have fun sampling the many varieties of the many different 
fruits around. How lovely it can be to stroll through your farmers’ market on a 
weekend and pick up locally grown fruits that you can zest onto your meals, blend 
into smoothies, chew when dried, incorporate into your favorite dishes, or best of all, 
bite right into. The opportunities are ripe for the picking! 
 Cruciferous Vegetables 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Cruciferous Vegetables 
Arugula, bok choy, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, 
horseradish, kale (black, green, and red), mustard greens, radishes, turnip greens, and 
watercress 
Serving Sizes: 
½ cup chopped 
¼ cup brussels or broccoli sprouts 
1 tablespoon horseradish 
Daily Recommendation: 
1 serving per day 
When I used to teach medical students at Tufts, I gave a lecture about this amazing 
new therapeutic called “iloccorB.” I’d talk about all the evidence supporting it, the 
great things it could do, and its excellent safety profile. Just as the students would 
start scrambling to buy stock in the company and prescribe it to their future patients, 
I’d do the big reveal. Apologizing for my “dyslexia”, I would admit that I’d gotten it 
backward. All this time, I had been talking about broccoli. 
I’ve mentioned broccoli more than any other food in this book, and for good 
reason. We’ve seen how cruciferous vegetables like broccoli can potentially prevent 
DNA damage and metastatic cancer spread in chapter 2, activate defenses against 
pathogens and pollutants in chapter 5, help to prevent lymphoma in chapter 9, boost 
your liver detox enzymes and target breast cancer stem cells in chapter 11, and 
reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression in chapter 13. The component 
responsible for these benefits is thought to be sulforaphane, which is formed almost 
exclusively in cruciferous vegetables. This is why they get their own spot on the 
Daily Dozen. 
Beyond being a promising anticancer agent,1 sulforaphane may also help protect 
your brain2 and your eyesight,3 reduce nasal allergy inflammation,4 manage type 2 
diabetes,5 and was recently found to successfully help treat autism. A placebo- 
controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of boys with autism found that about two 
to three cruciferous vegetable servings’ worth6 of sulforaphane a day improves 
social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication within a matter of 
weeks. The researchers, primarily from Harvard University and Johns Hopkins 
University, suggest that the effect might be due to sulforaphane’s role as a 
“detoxicant.”7 
Strategies to Enhance Sulforaphane Formation 
The formation of sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables is like a chemical flare 
reaction. It requires the mixing of a precursor compound with an enzyme called 
myrosinase, which is inactivated by cooking8 (though microwaved broccoli appears 
to retain some cancer-fighting capacity). This may explain why we see dramatic 
suppression of test-tube cancer-cell growth by raw broccoli, cauliflower, and 
brussels sprouts, but hardly any reaction when they’re cooked.9 But who wants to eat 
raw brussels sprouts? Not me. Thankfully, there are ways to get the benefits of raw 
vegetables in cooked form. 
Biting into broccoli is like snapping that chemical flare. When raw broccoli (or 
any other cruciferous vegetable) is chopped or chewed, the sulforaphane precursor 
mixes with the myrosinase enzyme and sulforaphane is created as the vegetable sits 
on the cutting board or lies in your upper stomach waiting to be digested.10 Though 
the enzyme is destroyed by cooking, both the precursor and the final product are 
resistant to heat. So here’s the trick: Use what I call the “Hack and Hold” technique 
(maybe I should call it Whack and Wait?). 
If you chop the broccoli (or brussels sprouts, kale, collards, cauliflower, or any 
other cruciferous vegetable) and then wait forty minutes, you can cook it as much as 
you want. At that point, the sulforaphane has already been made, so the enzyme is no 
longer needed to achieve maximum benefit. It’s already done its job. (You can also 
buy bags of fresh greens and other crucifers that are prechopped or shredded, which 
can presumably be cooked immediately.) 
Given this understanding, can you see how most people prepare broccoli soup 
incorrectly? Typically, they first cook the broccoli and then blend it. But, when you 
blend it, you’re merely mixing the precursor with an enzyme that’s been inactivated 
by cooking. Do it in the opposite order: First blend your veggies and then wait forty 
minutes before cooking them. This way, you can maximize sulforaphane production. 
What about frozen broccoli and other crucifers? Commercially produced frozen 
broccoli lacks the ability to form sulforaphane because the vegetables are blanched 
(flash-cooked) before they’re frozen for the very purpose of deactivating enzymes.11 
This process prolongs shelf life, but when you take the veggies out of your freezer, 
the enzyme is inert. At that point, it doesn’t matter how much you chop or how long 
you wait—no sulforaphane is going to be made. This may be why fresh kale has been 
shown to suppress cancer cell growth in vitro up to ten times better than frozen 
kale.12 
The frozen crucifer is still packed with the precursor, though—remember, it’s 
heat resistant. You could make lots of sulforaphane from it by adding back some 
enzyme.13 But where can you get myrosinase? Scientists buy theirs from chemical 
companies, but you can just walk into any grocery store. 
Mustard greens are also cruciferous vegetables. They grow from mustard seeds, 
which you can buy ground up in the spice aisle as mustard powder. If you sprinkled 
some mustard powder on frozen broccoli that’s been cooked, would it start churning 
out sulforaphane? Yes! 
Boiling broccoli prevents the formation of any significant levels of sulforaphane 
due to inactivation of the enzyme. However, the addition of powdered mustard seeds 
to cooked broccoli significantly increases sulforaphane formation.14 Then it’s almost 
as good as eating it raw! So, if you don’t have forty minutes to spare between 
chopping and cooking, or if you’re using frozen greens, just sprinkle the crucifers 
with some mustard powder before you eat them, and you’ll be all set. Daikon 
radishes, regular radishes, horseradish, and wasabi are all cruciferous vegetables 
and may have the same effect. All it appears to take is a pinch to revitalize 
sulforaphane production.15 You can also add a small amount of fresh greens to your 
cooked greens. So when I add shreds of purple cabbage to my finished dishes, it not 
only adds a beautiful garnish with a delightful crunch, it’s filled with the 
sulforaphane-producing enzyme. 
One of my first tasks every morning used to be chopping greens for the day, using 
my Hack and Hold technique. But now, with the Mustard Powder Plan, I have one 
less to-do on my list. 
Horseradish 
The serving sizes I offer here correspond roughly to the daily intake required to 
achieve cancer-preventive levels according to the innovative breast-surgery study I 
detailed in chapter 11. As you can see, horseradish has the smallest serving size, 
which means it’s the most concentrated of the cruciferous vegetables. One tablespoon 
and your Daily Dozen is down to an Everyday Eleven. Horseradish can be made into 
a sauce, relish, or dressing to score an extra check mark with a kick. It’s great in 
mashed potatoes or, for a healthier option still, mashed cauliflower. Just boil 
cauliflower for about ten minutes until tender and then mash with a fork or potato 
masher or purée in a food processor with some of the reserved cooking liquid until 
smooth. I season it with pepper, roasted garlic, and a dollop of horseradish and then 
pour mushroom gravy on it. Delicious! 
Roasting Cruciferous Vegetables 
As much as I love mashed cauliflower, roasted cauliflower (or broccoli, for that 
matter) is my favorite. Roasting brings out a nutty, caramelized flavor. I slice raw 
cauliflower into “steaks,” roast at 400°F for about a half hour, and then smother it in 
a lemon-tahini sauce. Sometimes I go minimalist and just sprinkle on lemon juice, 
zest, capers, and garlic. (This chapter is making me hungry!) 
Kale Chips 
I’ll talk about some of the more traditional ways I prepare greens in the next section, 
but kale chips deserve a special mention. You can use a dehydrator if you have one, 
but I often don’t have the patience. When I’m in the mood for kale chips, I want them 
now. They can be as simple as one ingredient: kale. Pull the leaves off the stems and 
tear into large pieces. Make sure that they are dry, or they’ll steam rather than crisp. 
Lay out the torn leaves in a single layer on a cookie tray lined with parchment paper 
or a silicone mat to prevent sticking, and bake at a low temperature (about 250°F) 
and check often to make sure they don’t burn. Within about twenty minutes, they 
transform into light, crispy snacks. Preseason the leaves before you roast them, or 
add your spices after they’re done. There are thousands of recipes online. I 
recommend starting with Ann Esselstyn’s recipe on her son Rip’s website, 
Engine2Diet.com.16 With kale chips, the more you snack, the healthier you are. 
Cruciferous Garnishes 
Similar to the way I use an open can of beans in the fridge as a reminder to try to 
bean-up any dish, we always have a purple (or red) cabbage in the crisper to help us 
cruciferize our meals. I slice off shreds and garnish nearly anything with them. Red 
cabbage averages about one dollar per pound,17 is found at pretty much any grocery 
store or market, can last weeks in the fridge (though if it does, that means you’re not 
using it enough!), and has more antioxidants per dollar than anything else you’ll find 
in the produce aisle. There are healthier foods you can buy, but not for the same 
amount of money. For example, purple cabbage may have nearly three times the 
antioxidant power per dollar that blueberries do.18 In terms of eating healthfully on a 
budget, purple cabbage can’t be beat. Or can it? 
After chopping and discarding the waste, red cabbage averages 45 cents a cup.19 
But broccoli sprouts—if you make them yourself—may be even cheaper. Broccoli 
sprout seeds can be purchased online or at natural foods stores for about twenty 
dollars a pound, but that makes about seventy-five cups of sprouts. In terms of 
sulforaphane content, that may be around three hundred cups of mature broccoli. So 
DIY broccoli sprouts provide a green-light sulforaphane source for about a nickel a 
day. 
Sprouting broccoli sprouts is as easy as sprouting lentils. Start with a mason jar 
with a sprouting (screen) lid. Add a tablespoon of seeds, let them soak overnight in 
water, drain in the morning, and then after that, just quickly rinse and drain twice a 
day. Most people wait for about five days, until the seeds fully sprout (taking on the 
look of alfalfa sprouts), but new science suggests sulforaphane content peaks at forty- 
eight hours after the seeds are initially drained.20 This makes them even quicker and 
easier to grow and eat. When I’m not traveling, I usually have a few jars in rotation. 
It can be the middle of winter, and I’m growing my own salad on my kitchen counter! 
Every day, you can get cups of fresh produce for your family without ever having to 
go to the store. 
Cruciferous Supplements? 
If you don’t like the taste of cruciferous vegetables but still want the benefits of the 
sulforaphane, what about the broccoli supplements currently on the market? 
Researchers recently put a leading commercial supplement to the test. BroccoMax 
boasts the equivalent of a half pound of broccoli in every capsule. Study subjects 
were given either six capsules a day or a single cup of broccoli sprouts. The 
supplement hardly worked at all, whereas the sprouts boosted blood levels about 
eight times higher for eight times less cost. The researchers concluded that “our data 
provide further evidence that bioavailability of [sulforaphane] is dramatically lower 
when subjects consume broccoli supplements compared to fresh broccoli sprouts.”21 
Too Much of a Good Thing? 
If broccoli sprouts are so cheap and effective, why not eat bowls of them? A formal 
safety analysis found no significant adverse effects to about one and a half cups a 
day,22 but we didn’t have data on a potential upper limit until a team of Italian 
researchers tried to push the envelope. They were attempting to come up with an 
intravenous infusion dose to use as chemotherapy, and so they wanted to know how 
high they could go. The researchers discovered that blood levels achieved by four or 
more cups of broccoli sprouts may indeed be detrimental.23 They concluded, 
however, that no harm was found at “nutritionally attainable concentrations.” But 
that’s not really true. Broccoli sprouts do have a radishy bite, but someone could 
theoretically eat four cups of sprouts a day. (They don’t know health nuts like I know 
some health nuts.) 
Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, someone came up to me after a lecture in 
Miami and told me he had heard that wheatgrass juice was good for you. “It cleans 
you out,” he had read. So he thought, Why not? and decided to stuff himself with it. 
He told me how he calculated the volume of the human digestive tract (all ten yards 
or so) and proceeded to drink that amount continuously, quart after quart, until it 
started coming out the other end. Intrigued, I asked him what happened. He looked up 
at me with an expression that I can only describe as rapturous and said, “It was 
volcanic.” 
It would be hard for me to say too many good things about crucifers. These 
vegetables do wonders for your health, from fighting cancer progression and boosting 
defenses against pathogens and pollutants to helping protect your brain and vision 
and more. And you can use this family of veggies as your excuse to play Mad 
Scientist in the kitchen, manipulating enzyme chemistry to maximize the health 
benefits. 
 Greens 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Greens 
Arugula, beet greens, collard greens, kale (black, green, and red), mesclun mix 
(assorted young salad greens), mustard greens, sorrel, spinach, swiss chard, and 
turnip greens 
Serving Sizes: 
1 cup raw 
½ cup cooked 
Daily Recommendation: 
2 servings per day 
Popeye was right when he bragged that he was strong to the finish because he ate his 
spinach. Dark-green, leafy vegetables are the healthiest foods on the planet. As 
whole foods go, they offer the most nutrition per calorie. Just to emphasize the point, 
there was a study published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer entitled 
“Antioxidant, Antimutagenic, and Antitumor Effects of Pine Needles.”1 Edible 
leaves, in all their shapes and sizes, it seems, can be healthy foods. 
In 1777, General George Washington issued a general order that American troops 
should forage for wild greens growing around their camps “as these vegetables are 
very conducive to health, and tend to prevent … all putrid disorders.”2 Since then, 
however, Americans have declared their independence from greens. Today, only 
about one in twenty-five even reach a dozen servings throughout the course of an 
entire month.3 I advise getting more than a dozen servings per week. 
IMPORTANT CAVEAT: Greens and Warfarin 
In 1984, the tragic case of a thirty-five-year-old woman unfolded when she failed to 
inform her physician about her change in diet. Because of her mechanical heart valve, 
the woman was on a blood-thinning drug called warfarin. But because she wanted to 
lose weight, she started eating a diet composed almost entirely of salad, broccoli, 
turnip greens, and mustard greens. Five weeks later, she suffered a blood clot and 
died.4 
If you are on the drug warfarin (also known as Coumadin), talk with your 
physician before you increase your greens intake. The drug works (both as a rat 
poison and a human blood-thinner) by crippling the enzyme that recycles vitamin K, 
which is involved in clotting your blood. If your system gets an influx of fresh 
vitamin K, which is concentrated in greens, you can thereby undermine the 
effectiveness of the drug. You should still be able to eat your greens, but your 
physician will have to titrate the dose of the drug to match your regular greens intake. 
Eating greens nearly every day may be one of the most powerful steps you can 
take to prolong your life.5 Of all the food groups analyzed by a team of Harvard 
University researchers, greens turned out to be associated with the strongest 
protection against major chronic diseases,6 including up to about a 20 percent 
reduction in risk for both heart attacks7 and strokes8 for every additional daily 
serving. 
Imagine if there were a pill that could prolong your life and only had good side 
effects. Everyone would be taking it! It would be making billions of dollars for the 
lucky drug company that created it. All health plans by law would have to cover it. 
People from every walk of life and every corner of the globe would be clamoring for 
it. But when that “pill” is just eat-your-greens, people lose interest. 
Drug companies have yet to patent broccoli (though Monsanto is trying!9). 
Doctors, however, don’t have to wait for perky pharmaceutical sales reps to wine, 
dine, and cajole them into prescribing Pfizer-brand spinach or GlaxoSmithKline- 
brand collards. Here’s my prescription for you: 
If the full spectrum of colorful plant pigments are good for you, why are greens the 
healthiest? When autumn in New England becomes aflame with brilliant hues, where 
do those oranges and yellows come from? They were there all along, actually—just 
masked by the green pigment chlorophyll that starts to break down in the fall.10 
Similarly, the dark-green leaves of vegetables contain many of the other plant 
pigments all wrapped up in one package. As I mentioned, these colorful compounds 
are often the very same antioxidants implicated in many of the benefits of fruit and 
vegetable consumption. So, in essence, when you eat your greens, you are eating the 
rainbow. 
How to Regenerate Coenzyme Q10 Naturally 
One of the reasons greens are some of the healthiest green-light foods may be due to 
their green color. Decades ago, a search began for “interceptor” molecules that could 
serve as the body’s first line of defense against cancer. The theory was that if we 
could find something that could tightly bind to carcinogens and prevent them from 
slipping into our DNA, we might be able to prevent some of the mutations that lead to 
cancer. After years of combing for the existence of such carcinogen-binding 
molecules, an interceptor was found: chlorophyll, the most ubiquitous plant pigment 
in the world. It was right under our noses all along (provided we were eating 
healthfully!).11 
In a petri dish, certain DNA damage in human cells exposed to a carcinogen could 
be “totally abolished” by chlorophyll.12 But what about in people? In the name of 
science, volunteers drank a solution of radioactive aflatoxin (a carcinogen) with or 
without spinach chlorophyll. Six cups of spinach worth of chlorophyll appeared to 
block about 40 percent of the carcinogen.13 Amazing! But that’s not all chlorophyll 
can do. 
In college, you learn that pretty much everything you were taught in high school 
biology wasn’t true. Then in graduate school, you unlearn all the oversimplifications 
you learned in college. Just when you think you understand something in biology, it 
always seems a little more complicated than you thought. For example, until recently, 
we assumed plants and plantlike organisms were the only ones that could directly 
capture and utilize the energy from the sun. Plants photosynthesize. Animals don’t. 
That’s because plants have chlorophyll and animals do not. Well, technically, you do 
have chlorophyll in your body—temporarily, at least—after you eat greens. But it 
would seem there’s no way the chlorophyll that enters your bloodstream after that 
salad could react with sunlight. After all, light can’t penetrate through your skin, 
right? 
Wrong. Any kid who’s ever shined a flashlight through her or his fingers could 
have told you that. 
The red wavelengths of sunlight do penetrate into your body.14 In fact, if you step 
outside on a sunny day, there’s enough light reaching your brain that you could 
actually read this page inside your skull.15 Your internal organs are bathed in 
sunlight, along with any chlorophyll circulating in your bloodstream. Although any 
energy produced by the chlorophyll would be negligible,16 it turns out that light- 
activated chlorophyll in your body may help regenerate a critical molecule called 
coenzyme Q10.17 
CoQ10, also known as ubiquinol, is an antioxidant. When ubiquinol extinguishes a 
free radical, it is oxidized to ubiquinone. To act as an effective antioxidant again, the 
body must regenerate ubiquinol from ubiquinone. Think of it like an electrical fuse: 
Ubiquinol can only be used once before having to be reset. That’s where sunlight and 
chlorophyll may come in. 
Researchers exposed some ubiquinone and dietary chlorophyll metabolites to the 
kind of light that reaches your bloodstream … and poof! CoQ10 was reborn. 
However, without the chlorophyll, or without the light, nothing happened. All along, 
we’ve been thinking that the main benefit of sunlight was only the formation of 
vitamin D and that the main benefit of greens was the antioxidants they contain. But 
now we suspect the combination of the two may actually help the body create and 
maintain its own internal stock of antioxidants. 
Eating a plant-based, chlorophyll-rich diet may be especially important for those 
on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, as these medications can interfere with CoQ10 
production. 
Green Can Taste Great 
I hope I’ve been able to convince you to eat greens as often as possible. The problem 
for many people is getting them to taste good. I’m afraid too many of us still suffer 
flashbacks from overcooked, slimy green lumps on school cafeteria trays. 
Take kale, for example. Fibrous and grassy tasting, right? Kind of bitter too? 
Some varieties are more palatable than others. In a good supermarket produce 
section, you may be able to find three types: green, black, and red. Nutritionally, the 
differences among them appear to be insignificant compared to how much of each you 
may be willing to eat.18,19 The healthiest kale is the one you’ll eat the most of. 
I would suggest using black kale (also called lacinato, dinosaur, or Tuscan kale), 
red kale (also found as red Russian kale), or baby kale, since these varieties are all 
milder and more tender than the more common mature green (curly) kale. 
Start by rinsing the leaves thoroughly under running water. Then rip off the stems 
and tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Alternatively, after the leaves are removed 
from their stems, roll them up and slice into thin ribbons. If you want to make it even 
easier on yourself, just use whatever type you can find frozen. Frozen greens are 
cheaper, last longer, and come prewashed and prechopped. 
There’s a phenomenon called flavor-flavor conditioning in which you can change 
your palate by linking a less pleasant flavor (for instance, sour or bitter) with a more 
pleasant one (say, sweet). For example, when researchers tried adding sugar to sour 
grapefruit juice, people liked it better. No surprise. But within a few days, the study 
subjects began to like even unsweetened grapefruit juice more than they did before 
the experiment started. In fact, this reconditioning of the palate lasted for at least 
weeks after the sugar was removed.20 
The same happens when researchers dip or spritz broccoli with sugar water or 
aspartame.21 I know that sounds gross, but they’re not actually making the broccoli 
taste sweet. The added sweetness merely masks the bitterness by fooling your taste 
buds.22 This is why the so-called secret ingredient in many collard greens recipes is 
a spoonful of sugar. Certainly, if there were ever a food to justify the use of a yellow- 
or red-light condiment to boost consumption, it would be the single healthiest of all 
foods: greens. I use a balsamic glaze even though it has some added sugar in it. It 
would be healthier, though, to add green-light sweetness in the form of something like 
figs or grated apples. 
The sweetness trick is why green smoothies can be so delicious (if not a little odd 
looking). Smoothies can be a great way to introduce greens into children’s diets. The 
basic triad is a liquid, ripe fruit, and fresh greens. I’d start with a two-to-one ratio of 
fruits to greens to start with before tipping heavier toward greens on the scale. So, 
for example, one cup of water, a frozen banana, a cup of frozen berries, and a cup of 
packed baby spinach would be a classic green smoothie 101. 
I like to add fresh mint leaves as well for a boost of flavor (and even more 
greens). Fresh herbs can be expensive at the store, but mint can grow like a weed in 
your yard or in a pot on your windowsill. Eating greens for breakfast can be as 
delicious as mint chocolate oatmeal—cooked oatmeal, chopped mint leaves, cocoa 
powder, and a healthy sweetener (see here). 
When you’re thinking about ways to pair your greens with something you already 
love to make the greens more palatable, consider mixing them with a green-light 
source of fat: nuts, seeds, nut or seed butters, or avocados. Many of the nutrients 
greens are famous for are fat soluble, including beta-carotene, lutein, vitamin K, and 
zeaxanthin. So pairing your greens with a green-light source of fat may not only make 
them taste better but will maximize nutrient absorption. This can mean enjoying a 
creamy tahini-based dressing on your salad, putting walnuts in your pesto, or 
sprinkling some toasted sesame seeds on your sautéed kale. 
The jump in nutrient absorption is no small effect. When researchers tried feeding 
people a healthy salad of spinach, romaine, carrots, and tomatoes along with a source 
of fat, there was an impressive spike in carotenoid phytonutrients in their 
bloodstream over the next eight hours. With a fat-free dressing, carotenoid absorption 
flatlined down to negligible amounts; it was as if they’d never eaten the salad at all.23 
Similarly, adding some avocado to your salsa may triple the amount of fat-soluble 
nutrients that make it into your bloodstream (in this case, the lycopene in the 
tomatoes).24 It doesn’t take much. Just three grams of fat in an entire hot meal may be 
sufficient to boost absorption.25 That’s just a single walnut or a spoonful of avocado 
or shredded coconut. Snack on a few pistachios after a meal, and you’re all set. The 
greens and the source of fat just have to end up in your stomach at the same time. 
Another way to remove bitterness from greens is to blanch or boil them, but 
unfortunately this works by leaching some of the healthy compounds into the cooking 
water.26 If you’re making soup, that’s not a problem, because the nutrients aren’t 
destroyed as much as they are displaced. If the cooking liquid is poured off, 
however, you could be losing some nutrition. But even if 50 percent of these healthy 
compounds go down the drain, if the decreased bitterness motivates you to eat twice 
as many greens, problem solved! Whenever I’m boiling pasta, for example, I’ll add a 
bunch of fresh greens to the pot a few minutes before I’m ready to drain the pasta. I 
know I’ll be losing some nutrients when I pour off the cooking water, but it’s worth it 
to me for the convenience of throwing everything into one pot and getting my family 
to eat even more greens. 
Try to incorporate greens into as many meals as possible. I put just about 
everything I eat on a bed of greens. That way, the greens take on the flavor of the rest 
of the dish. However, if you want to eat cooked greens “straight,” you can try adding 
lemon juice, flavored vinegars, red pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, low-sodium soy 
sauce, or caramelized onions. I personally like mine hot, sweet, smoky, and salty. I 
use hot sauce for heat, balsamic glaze for sweetness, and both smoked paprika and 
liquid smoke. For saltiness, I used to be fond of a soy sauce substitute called Bragg 
Liquid Aminos until I got more serious about cutting down my sodium intake. The 
best sodium-free salt substitute I’ve been able to find is something called Table 
Tasty. (What’s with these names?) 
There are whole grocery aisles full of prepared sauces with which you can 
experiment. Most have added salt, oil, or sugar, so I try to reserve them for 
exceptionally healthy foods. Mixing yellow- and red-light foods together (like 
dipping your fries and McNuggets in barbecue sauce) may just add insult to injury, 
but I wouldn’t eat half as many baked rosemary sweet-potato fries if I weren’t 
dipping them in hot-sauce-spiked ketchup. And if there were ever an excuse to dip 
out of the green-light zone, it would be for green, leafy vegetables. 
During my bachelor days, I would regularly order Chinese food for delivery— 
usually broccoli and garlic sauce (hold the white rice). Then I’d throw brown rice or 
quinoa along with dried lentils into my rice cooker and steam or microwave a pound 
of greens. By the time the delivery arrived, everything was ready and I would just 
mix it all together and have more than enough for leftovers. 
You can also find prepackaged pouches of Indian food online or at Indian or 
natural foods markets. Again, I’d use them as sauces rather than eat them as a meal in 
themselves. My favorite is spinach dal—that way, I’m eating greens in a greens 
sauce! That’s like the kale-pesto principle: Use one green (basil) to make the other 
green (kale) taste better. 
The Health Benefits of Vinegar 
Vinegar may be one condiment that’s good for you. Randomized, controlled trials 
involving both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals suggest that adding two 
teaspoons of vinegar to a meal may improve blood sugar control, effectively blunting 
the blood sugar spike after a meal by about 20 percent.27 So adding vinegar to potato 
salad or to rice (like the Japanese do to make sushi rice) or dipping bread in 
balsamic vinegar may blunt the effects of these high-glycemic foods. 
We’ve known about the antiglycemic effect of vinegar for more than twenty-five 
years, but we’re still not sure of the mechanism.28 Originally, it was thought that 
vinegar slowed stomach emptying, but even consuming vinegar outside of meals 
appears to help. Type 2 diabetics consuming two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar 
at bedtime, for example, were found to wake up with better blood sugars in the 
morning.29 Consuming pickles or vinegar pills does not seem to have the same 
effect.30 Do not, however, drink vinegar straight, as it can burn your esophagus,31 or 
in excess—a cup a day for six years (that’s two thousand cups!) was discovered to 
be a bad idea.32 
Vinegar may also help with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), improve arterial 
function, and help reduce body fat. A daily tablespoon of apple cider vinegar 
restored ovarian function within a few months in four out of seven women with 
PCOS.33 A tablespoon of rice vinegar was found to acutely improve artery function 
in postmenopausal women. We’re not sure why, but the acetate from the acetic acid 
in vinegar may lead to improved nitric-oxide production (see here).34 Such an effect 
would be expected to help with hypertension, and indeed there is a study purporting 
to show blood pressure benefits from a tablespoon of vinegar a day.35 
Despite folk wisdom to the contrary, vinegar does not appear to be an effective 
treatment for head lice,36 but it may help with weight loss. A double-blind, placebo- 
controlled (but vinegar company–funded) study was performed, in which obese 
subjects consumed daily vinegar drinks with either one or two tablespoons of apple 
cider vinegar, or a placebo drink that tasted like vinegar but contained no acetic acid. 
Both vinegar groups lost significantly more weight than the control group. Though the 
effect was modest—about four pounds over a three-month period—CT scans showed 
the vinegar groups’ subjects lost a significant amount of their “visceral” fat, the 
abdominal fat that is particularly associated with chronic disease risk.37 
There are all sorts of flavorful, exotic vinegars to explore these days, including 
fig, peach, and pomegranate. I encourage you to experiment and find ways to 
incorporate some into your diet. 
Salad Days 
Having a big salad every day is a great way to burn through the Daily Dozen. To a 
base of mesclun greens and arugula, I add tomato, red bell pepper, beans, and 
barberries, along with toasted nuts if I’m using a fat-free dressing. My current 
favorite dressing recipe is a Caesar spin-off shared by Dr. Michael Klaper from the 
TrueNorth Health Center: 
2 tablespoons almond meal 
3 cloves crushed garlic 
3 tablespoons dijon mustard 
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes 
2 tablespoons white miso 
3 tablespoons lemon juice 
1/3 cup water 
Blend and enjoy! (If you have a high-speed blender, you could probably use 
whole almonds instead of meal.) 
Baby spinach may have higher levels of phytonutrients than mature spinach 
leaves,38 but what about real baby spinach—so-called microgreens, the seedlings of 
vegetables and herbs? A nutritional analysis of twenty-five commercially available 
microgreens found they did have significantly higher nutrient densities. For example, 
red cabbage microgreens have a sixfold higher vitamin C concentration than mature 
red cabbage and nearly seventy times the vitamin K.39 But they’re eaten in such 
microquantities that even the healthiest upscale restaurant garnish probably isn’t 
going to do much for you. 
If, however, you want to grow your own, you could have rotating trays of 
microgreens that you snip off with scissors for probably the healthiest salad out there. 
(On a lecture tour, I once stayed with someone who did just that, and I’ve been 
jealous ever since.) Microgreens are the perfect plants for the impatient gardener— 
fully grown in just one to two weeks. 
The One Green to Avoid 
Although greens are the healthiest of foods, there’s one green I caution against eating: 
alfalfa sprouts. Over a dozen years, twenty-eight outbreaks of Salmonella food 
poisoning linked to sprouts have been documented in the United States, affecting 
1,275 people.40 Of course, Salmonella-tainted eggs sicken an estimated 142,000 
Americans every year,41 but that doesn’t make it any less tragic for those hospitalized 
and killed in “sproutbreaks.” Alfalfa sprout seeds have all sorts of microscopic 
nooks and crannies where bacteria from manure-contaminated irrigation water can 
hide. So even home-sprouted alfalfa seeds should not be considered safe. 
I will never forget a presentation I gave in Boston. It was in a game show–style 
format in which contestants from the audience tried to rank, from healthiest to 
unhealthiest, the foods I’d brought with me. There was a lively cacophony of 
conflicting advice shouted from the crowd. You can imagine the groans when I 
revealed that alfalfa sprouts—a quintessential health food—belonged way at the top 
on the foods-to-avoid list. 
Later that night, I was stuck with the sprouts after all the healthier and yummier 
items had been given away as prizes. I had just told my audience not to eat them—but 
I hate wasting food. In a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do moment, I added them to my salad 
that night. Yes, they had been sitting in the car all day and on stage for hours. Yes, 
they were at the top of my game show’s list of foods you should not eat. But, what 
were the odds that that one particular package was contaminated? I went back to 
work the next day at the New England Medical Center emergency room—not as a 
physician but as a patient with Salmonella food poisoning. 
So other than the dreaded alfalfa sprout, greens truly are the healthiest foods on the 
planet. You simply can’t do better in terms of nutrition per calorie. Explore, 
innovate, taste test, play, and teach your palate to enjoy them. Whether you sneak 
them into a refreshing smoothie, incorporate them into sauces and dressings, use them 
as a base for main dishes, or eat them straight in a big, vibrant salad—just do it. Your 
body will thank you with every bite of greens you take.

oyster, portobello, and shiitake), okra, onions, purple potatoes, pumpkin, sea 
vegetables (arame, dulse, and nori), snap peas, squash (delicata, summer, and 
spaghetti squash varieties), sweet potatoes/yams, tomatoes, and zucchini 
Serving Sizes:

Daily Recommendation: 
2 servings per day 
The mammoth Global Burden of Disease Study identified the typical American diet 
as the primary cause of Americans’ death and disability1 and inadequate vegetable 
intake as our fifth-leading dietary risk factor, nearly as bad as our consumption of 
processed meat.2 The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that if the nation 
increased its consumption of fruits and veggies to meet the dietary guidelines, we 
might save the lives of more than one hundred thousand people a year.3 
You should eat more fruits and vegetables as if your life depended on it, because 
maybe it does. 
Garden Variety: Diversifying Your Vegetable Portfolio 
Perhaps the least controversial advice in all of nutrition is to eat more fruits and 
vegetables, which is to say eat more plants, since the term vegetable basically just 
means all parts of the plant that aren’t fruit. There are root vegetables like sweet 
potatoes, stem vegetables like rhubarb, pod vegetables like peas, and even flower 
vegetables like broccoli. (It isn’t called cauliflower for nothing.) We’ve already 
talked about the leaf vegetables in the greens section. If dark-green, leafy vegetables 
are the healthiest foods around, then why branch out to other parts of the plant? (Pun 
intended!) Yes, you’re supposed to eat the rainbow, but didn’t we just learn that 
green leaves have an entire spectrum of colors hidden inside? 
Unlike more generic compounds like vitamin C, which is broadly available in 
various fruits and vegetables, other nutrients are not so evenly distributed. Just as 
certain fruits like citrus offer unique nonpigment phytonutrients not found in other 
fruits, different vegetables contribute different compounds. White cauliflower, 
lacking antioxidant pigments, doesn’t appear to have much to offer at first glance, but 
because it belongs to the cruciferous family, it’s one of your healthiest options. 
Similarly, white mushrooms may look pretty drab, but they can provide myconutrients 
not found in the entire plant kingdom. 
We now know that certain phytonutrients bind to specific receptors and other 
proteins in the body. I talked about the Ah “broccoli receptors” in chapter 5. There 
are also effectively green-tea receptors in your body—that is, receptors for EGCG, a 
key component of green tea. There are binding proteins for the phytonutrients in 
grapes, onions, and capers. Recently, a cell surface receptor was even identified for 
a nutrient concentrated in apple peels. These specific proteins may not be activated, 
though, unless you eat specific foods.4 
The different phytonutrient profiles may then result in different clinical effects. 
For example, drinking tomato juice can rescue the immune function of study subjects 
crippled by two weeks of fruit and vegetable deficiency, but carrot juice apparently 
cannot.5 Even different parts of the same vegetable can have different effects. One of 
the reasons certain tomato products appear to be protective against heart attacks6 is 
because the yellow fluid surrounding the seeds concentrates a compound that 
suppresses platelet activation.7 (Platelets are what help trigger the blood clots that 
cause heart attacks and most strokes.) Aspirin has a similar effect, but it doesn’t work 
in everyone and can increase bleeding risk—two limitations that the tomato 
compound may be able to overcome.8,9 But if you only consume tomato sauce, juice, 
or ketchup, you may be missing out10 since the seeds are removed during processing. 
So when picking out canned tomato products, choose whole, crushed, or diced 
tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, purée, or paste. 
Different plants may also affect the same part of the body in different ways. 
Consider mental function, for instance. In a study of dozens of fruits and vegetables, 
from raspberries to rutabagas, certain plants appear to shore up specific cognitive 
domains. For example, the consumption of some plant foods was associated with 
better executive function, perceptual speed, and semantic (fact-based) memory, while 
the consumption of others was more consistently associated with visual-spatial skills 
and autobiographical memory.11 In other words, you may need to build up a portfolio 
of many fruits and vegetables to cover all your bases. 
One of the reasons studies may underestimate the protective effects of plant foods 
is that they tend to measure quantity of fruit and vegetable consumption rather than 
quality of fruit and vegetable consumption. People are more likely to eat bananas and 
cucumbers than blueberries and kale. But variety is important too. Half the fruit 
servings in the United States are taken up by just five fruits—apples and apple juice, 
bananas, grapes, orange juice, and watermelon—and most vegetable servings are 
from canned tomatoes, potatoes, and iceberg lettuce.12 
In one of the few studies that looked specifically at the diversity of fruit and 
vegetable consumption, the variety of intake was an even better predictor of 
decreased inflammation in the bodies of middle-aged adults than the absolute quantity 
of consumption.13 Even after removing the effects of quantity, the addition of two 
different types of fruits and vegetables per week has been associated with an 8 
percent reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes.14 These kinds of data led the 
American Heart Association to add a recommendation in their latest dietary 
guidelines to also eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.15 It’s an important addition; 
otherwise, a big bag of potato chips or one head of iceberg lettuce could technically 
fulfill or exceed your recommended nine servings a day. 
It’s better to eat a whole orange rather than take a vitamin C pill, since the pill 
deprives you of all the other wonderful nutrients in the oranges themselves. The same 
principle applies when you don’t diversify your fruit and vegetable consumption. By 
only eating apples, you also miss out on oranges’ nutrients. You don’t get the 
limonoids in citrus, like limonin, limonol, or tangeretin, though you may get more 
malic acid (from the Latin malum, meaning apple). When it comes to the unique 
phytonutrient profile of each fruit and vegetable, it’s like comparing apples to 
oranges! That’s why you should mix it up. 
In a sense, though, all fruits are just fruits, whereas vegetables can be any other 
part of the plant. Roots may harbor different nutrients than shoots. For this reason, it 
may be even more important to get in a variety of vegetables, so you can benefit from 
all parts of the plant, as one large cancer study of nearly a half-million people did 
indeed find.16 “Because each vegetable contains a unique combination,” a recent 
review concluded, “a great diversity of vegetables should be eaten … to get all the 
health benefits.”17 Variety is not only the spice of life; it may prolong it as well. 
Eating Better to Look Better 
We’ve all heard of the proverbial golden glow that’s often equated with health, 
vitality, and youth. But instead of using a tanning bed to achieve a more golden hue, 
you can do it with a bed of greens. 
There are certain animals who use diet to increase their sexual attractiveness. 
Great tits, distinctive olive-and-black songbirds ubiquitous throughout Europe and 
Asia, tend to prefer carotenoid-rich caterpillars, which make their breast plumage 
brighter yellow, to become more attractive to potential mates.18 Can a similar 
phenomenon be found in humans? 
Researchers took digital photographs of African, Asian, and Caucasian men and 
women and asked others to manipulate the skin tone of their faces with a dial until 
they reached what they perceived to be the healthiest-looking color.19 Sure enough, 
both men and women preferred the yellow “golden glow” that can be achieved 
through “dietary carotenoid deposition in the skin.”20 In other words, by eating the 
yellow and red pigments in fruits and vegetables, like beta-carotene in sweet 
potatoes and lycopene in tomatoes, men and women may be able to naturally acquire 
more of a golden and rosy glow. Researchers decided to put it to the test. 
Based on a six-week study of college students, the complexion achieved by eating 
my Daily Dozen recommendation of nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day was 
found to be significantly healthier and more attractive looking than that achieved by 
eating three daily servings.21 The healthier you eat, the healthier you look. Indeed, 
studies find that “individuals with the lowest fruit and vegetable intake may enjoy the 
most improvement in appearance.”22 
What about wrinkles? A study out of Japan used the six-point Daniell scale to rate 
the extent of crow’s-feet wrinkles around the eyes of more than seven hundred 
women, with a score of one being the least severe and a score of six being the most 
severe. The researchers found that “a higher intake of green and yellow vegetables 
was associated with decreased facial wrinkling.” Women who ate less than one daily 
serving of green and yellow veggies averaged about a three on the Daniell scale, 
while women who ate more than two servings a day averaged closer to a two. The 
researchers celebrated “the potential for these studies to promote a healthy diet…”23 
I am certainly not above appealing to vanity, especially for my younger patients 
who have seemed more interested in which dietary changes will clear their acne than 
which will clear their future risk of chronic disease. So I’m happy to see articles 
embrace these types of studies with headlines like “Greens to Be Gorgeous.”24 Still, 
although looking great on the outside is fine, looking great on the inside is even 
better. 
Mushrooming Benefits 
Ergothioneine is an unusual amino acid. Although it was discovered more than a 
century ago, it was ignored until recently when researchers found that humans have a 
transporter protein in their bodies specifically designed to pull ergothioneine out of 
food and into body tissue. This suggests that this amino acid plays some important 
physiological role. But what? Our first clue was the tissue distribution. Ergothioneine 
concentrates in parts of your body where there is a lot of oxidative stress—your liver 
and the lenses of your eyes, for example, as well as such sensitive tissues as bone 
marrow and semen. Researchers guessed, then, that it might act as a so-called 
cytoprotectant, a cell protector, and that’s indeed what was subsequently found.25 
Ergothioneine appears to function as a potent intramitochondrial antioxidant, 
meaning it can get inside the mitochondria—the microscopic power plants within 
your cells. The DNA inside the mitochondria is especially vulnerable to free-radical 
damage, since many other antioxidants are unable to penetrate the mitochondrial 
membrane. This is one reason ergothioneine may be so important. Depriving human 
cells of this amino acid leads to accelerated DNA damage and cell death. 
Unfortunately, the human body cannot make ergothioneine; you can only get it through 
food. “Because of its dietary origin and the toxicity associated with its depletion,” 
Johns Hopkins University researchers concluded, “ET [ergothioneine] may represent 
a new vitamin…”26 If it were classified as such, that would make it the first new 
vitamin since vitamin B12 was isolated back in 1948.27 
What are the best dietary sources of ergothioneine? The highest levels by far have 
been reported in mushrooms. For example, oyster mushrooms, which you can grow 
yourself in only two weeks from a just-add-water kit, have more than one thousand 
units (μg/dag) of ergothioneine, about nine times more than their closest competitor, 
black beans. And a serving of black beans has about eight times more than a serving 
of the third-leading source, chicken liver. Chicken meat, along with beef and pork, 
only has about ten units, one hundred times less than oyster mushrooms. Kidney beans 
have about four times more than meat, but even at forty-five units, they pale in 
comparison to some of the mushrooms.28 
Ergothioneine is heat stable, which means it’s not destroyed when mushrooms are 
cooked.29 This is good news, because it’s best not to eat mushrooms raw; there’s a 
toxin in edible mushrooms called agaritine to which you should minimize your 
exposure. Thankfully, the toxin is destroyed by cooking. Just thirty seconds in the 
microwave wipes out most agaritine in mushrooms. Freezing also gets rid of most of 
it, but drying does not. If you put dried mushrooms in your soup, it’s best to boil them 
for at least five minutes.30 Morel mushrooms are a special case. The toxin levels 
appear higher and may react with alcohol even after cooking.31 I consider all other 
cooked edible mushrooms to be green-light foods and all other edible raw 
mushrooms yellow-light foods. However, raw morel mushrooms, cooked morels 
served with alcohol, and all wild-foraged mushrooms should be on the red-light list 
in my opinion. 
Do you have to eat mushrooms to be healthy? No. (Otherwise, it would be the 
Daily Baker’s Dozen.) Famously in our family, my mom has never eaten a mushroom 
in her life and never will, because they “look funny.” But given the potential immune 
and anticancer benefits documented in chapters 5 and 11, I would encourage you to 
try to find ways to incorporate them into your diet. 
My favorite way to enjoy mushrooms is to grill portobellos. I picked up a George 
Foreman Grill from my local thrift store, and my family has officially renamed it the 
Portobello Mushroom Grill. I know people tend to marinate portobellos first, but I 
just drizzle them with balsamic vinegar, grill until the juice starts dripping, and then 
add cracked pepper. They’re so good we eat them just like that. 
Pop quiz: Which is healthier? Plain white mushrooms or portobellos? Trick 
question! They’re the same mushroom. The little white button mushrooms grow up to 
be portobellos. White mushrooms are just baby ’bellos. 
Mushrooms can be stuffed, enjoyed in soups like mushroom barley, act as the star 
of a creamy risotto or pâté, serve as the base of a great gravy or as a flavorful 
addition to any pasta sauce, or simply be braised with crushed garlic in red wine. 
Even More Vegetables! 
My favorite way to eat raw veggies is to dip bell pepper strips, carrots, or snap peas 
in a hummus or bean dip, and my favorite way to eat them cooked is by roasting them. 
Roasting can transform vegetables into otherworldly creations. If you don’t believe 
me, try roasting red bell peppers, brussels sprouts, beets, or squash. Never thought 
you liked okra because it’s too slimy? Try it roasted. 
One of my favorite springtime dishes is roasted asparagus dipped in guacamole. 
(Here’s an interesting asparagus fact: Did you know there are four types of people in 
the world? Those whose pee turns stinky after eating asparagus, and those whose 
doesn’t, and those who are apparently genetically incapable of smelling the 
asparagus pee odor, and, finally, those who can. So some people may not think they 
get stinky pee from asparagus, but they actually do and just can’t smell it!32) 
Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite snacks. During harsh Boston winters while 
I was in medical school, I would take two freshly microwaved sweet potatoes and 
pop them in my coat pockets as natural hand warmers. When they cooled down, my 
hand warmers became instant healthy snacks! It’s actually better to boil them, though, 
to best preserve their nutritional content.33 Regardless of your cooking method, be 
sure to keep on the skin. The peel of the sweet potato has nearly ten times the 
antioxidant power as the inner flesh (on a per-weight basis), giving them an 
antioxidant capacity approaching that of blueberries.34 
Sweet potatoes themselves can be considered a superfood.35 They are ranked as 
one of the healthiest foods on the planet36 and one day, perhaps, even off the planet— 
NASA has chosen them for future space missions.37 In fact, they’re among the 
healthiest and cheapest, with one of the highest nutrient-rich food scores per dollar.38 
When picking out varieties at the supermarket, remember that a sweet potato’s 
nutritional content is tied directly to the intensity of its color. The more yellow or 
orange its flesh, the healthier it may be.39 
Sweet potatoes are healthier than plain potatoes, but if you’re going to choose the 
latter, seek out those with blue or purple flesh. The consumption of one boiled purple 
potato a day for six weeks was found to significantly decrease inflammation, 
something neither white nor yellow potatoes were able to accomplish.40 The same 
was found for oxidation, but much faster. Within hours of consumption, purple 
potatoes increased the antioxidant capacity of study subjects’ bloodstream, whereas 
white potato starch appeared to actually have a pro-oxidant effect.41 Blue potatoes 
may have ten times more antioxidant power than regular white ones.42 The most 
exciting purple potato study to date had people with hypertension eat six to eight 
microwaved small purple potatoes a day, and they were able to significantly bring 
down their blood pressure levels within a month.43 
Purple sweet potatoes may offer the best of both worlds.44 I was so excited to 
discover them that I bought them as holiday gifts for my family one year—stocking 
stuffers they could stuff themselves with! 
Getting Kids (and Parents) to Eat Their Veggies 
Published strategies for getting kids (of all ages) to eat their vegetables include 
cutting them into slices, sticks, or stars—the most popular shape.45 Supposedly, 
putting an Elmo sticker on veggies swayed 50 percent of children to choose broccoli 
over a chocolate bar.46 If they’re still not biting, though, you can apply the same trick 
I use to get our dog to take her pills: Dip the veggies in peanut butter. A study found 
that pairing vegetables with peanut butter successfully increases intake “even in 
vegetable-resistant children.”47 Offering a salad dressing dip has also been found to 
help.48 
Simply having healthy foods out and available can boost intake. Guess what 
happened when researchers put out bowls of cut-up fresh fruit in addition to the 
regular party fare brought by parents for kindergarten or preschool celebrations? No 
special effort was made to encourage students to choose the fruit—the researchers 
just put it out on the table with all the other food. Would kids actually eat fruit when 
such foods as birthday cake, ice cream, and cheese puffs were available? Yes! On 
average, each kid ate a full fruit serving.49 Take that, cheese puffs! 
Even just calling vegetables by different names can help. Elementary schools 
were able to double vegetable consumption simply by coming up with names that 
better appealed to the kids. Students ate twice the number of carrots if they were 
called “X-Ray Vision Carrots,” compared to when they were just carrots or 
generically called the “Food of the Day.”50 Are adults as gullible? Apparently so. 
For example, grown-ups reported “Traditional Cajun Red Beans and Rice” tasted 
better than just “Red Beans with Rice” … even though they were the exact same 
dish.51 
When school cafeterias put out signs like Power Punch Broccoli and Silly Dilly 
Green Beans, or called broccoli Tiny Tasty Tree Tops, selection of broccoli 
increased by about 110 percent, and selection of green beans jumped by nearly 180 
percent.52 The researchers concluded that “these studies demonstrate that using an 
attractive name to describe a healthy food in a cafeteria is robustly effective, 
persistent, and scalable with little or no money or experience. These names were not 
carefully crafted, discussed in focus groups, and then pretested.” They were just 
invented out of thin air. And kids were suckered into eating healthier for weeks 
simply by adults’ putting out silly little signs. Indeed, in the school displaying these 
playful new names in the cafeteria line, vegetable purchasing went up nearly 100 
percent, while in the control school without signs, vegetable purchases started low 
and actually got worse.53 So why isn’t every single school in the country doing this 
right now? Bring it up at your next PTA meeting. 
Let’s not forget the hide-the-veggies strategy. Studies have shown that broccoli, 
cauliflower, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini can be added covertly to familiar entrées 
such that the appearance, flavor, and texture of the original recipes are maintained 
(like puréeing vegetables into a pasta sauce).54 Studies found the trick works for 
adults too. Researchers were able to slip in up to a pound of clandestine vegetables a 
day (resulting in 350 fewer calories eaten).55 Surreptitiously incorporating 
vegetables into foods shouldn’t be the only way that vegetables are served to 
children, though. Since the appetite for an initially unappetizing vegetable can be 
increased through repeated exposure, it is important to use several strategies to 
ensure that kids experience whole vegetables. After all, they’re not always going to 
be eating at home. One of the most important predictors of children’s fruit and 
vegetable consumption has been found to be parents’ consumption,56 so if you want 
your kids to eat healthfully, it helps to be a healthy role model. 
The Top Cancer-Fighting Vegetables 
According to a landmark American Institute for Cancer Research report, any effect of 
plant-based diets is “likely to be due not only to the exclusion of meat, but also to the 
inclusion of a larger number and of wider range of plant foods, containing an 
extensive variety of potential cancer-preventive substances.”57 In other words, it may 
not be enough to cut down on meat; you need to eat as many whole, healthy plant 
foods as possible. Meatless Mondays are great, but even more so when followed by 
Tomato Tuesdays, Watercress Wednesdays, and so on. 
Different vegetables may target different cancers—sometimes even in the same 
organ. For example, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts are 
associated with lower risk of colon cancer in the middle and right side of your body, 
whereas risk of colon cancer farther down on the left side appears to be lowered 
more by carrots, pumpkins, and apples.58 
An extraordinary study published in the journal Food Chemistry pitted thirty-four 
common vegetables in vitro against eight different types of human cancer cells: breast 
cancer, brain tumors, kidney cancer, lung cancer, childhood brain tumors, pancreatic 
cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. Take breast cancer, for example. Seven 
vegetables (eggplant, bok choy, carrot, tomato, endive, fennel bulb, and romaine 
lettuce) appeared useless, suppressing breast cancer cell growth no more than the 
control. Six vegetables (orange bell pepper, english cucumber, radicchio, jalapeño, 
potato, and beetroot) nearly halved cancer growth, but five veggies (cauliflower, 
brussels sprouts, green onion, leek, and garlic) “abolished” cancer growth 
completely, stopping breast tumor cells dead in their tracks.59 
There were two take-home messages to come out of this remarkable study. The 
first is that you should eat a portfolio of vegetables. Radishes, for example, are 
completely unable to stop pancreatic cancer cell growth. However, radishes were 
100 percent effective at halting the growth of stomach cancer cells. Orange bell 
peppers were useless against stomach cancer, but they were able to suppress prostate 
cancer cell growth by more than 75 percent. In the words of the researchers, “a 
diversified diet, containing several distinct classes of vegetables (and hence of 
phytochemicals) is essential for effective prevention of cancer.”60 
How to Make a Cancer-Fighting Salad 
Imagine you’re standing in line at one of those made-to-order salad places where you 
get to choose your lettuce, your toppings, and your dressing. You start with the 
greens. For the sake of this example, let’s say you are offered a choice between the 
five covered in the Food Chemistry study: Boston lettuce, endive, radicchio, romaine 
lettuce, and spinach. Which should you choose? Based on the study findings: spinach. 
Out of the five options, spinach beat out the others against breast cancer, brain 
tumors, kidney cancer, lung cancer, pediatric brain tumors, pancreatic cancer, 
prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. The runner up? Radicchio.61 
Which toppings should you add to your spinach salad? You only get five to 
choose from and, after consulting the Daily Dozen cheat sheet in your wallet, you can 
tick three check boxes immediately: beans, berries, and nuts. Now you only have two 
toppings left. Out of the thirty-two remaining vegetables included in the study, which 
two of the following should you pick? Choose carefully: 
Acorn squash 
Asparagus 
Beetroot 
Bok choy 
Boston lettuce 
Broccoli 
Brussels sprouts 
Cabbage 
Carrot 
Cauliflower 
Celery 
Curly cabbage 
Eggplant 
Endive 
English cucumber 
Fennel bulb 
Fiddleheads 
Garlic 
Green beans 
Green onions 
Jalapeño 
Kale 
Leek 
Orange bell pepper 
Potato 
Radicchio 
Radish 
Red cabbage 
Romaine lettuce 
Rutabaga 
Tomato 
Yellow onion 
Which two did you choose? If one of your choices was brussels sprouts, cabbage, 
curly cabbage, or kale, and the other choice was garlic, green onions, or leek, you get 
a gold star! Of all the vegetables tested, those had the most cancer-preventing 
potential. Notice anything they have in common? All the top choices belong to one of 
only two superfood families: cruciferous vegetables and the allium veggie family, 
which includes garlic and onions. As the researchers put it, “the inclusion of 
cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based 
chemopreventive [cancer-preventing] strategies.”62 
Note that the most common vegetables didn’t make the cut. “The majority of the 
vegetable extracts tested in this study, including vegetables that are commonly 
consumed in Western countries such as potato, carrot, lettuce and tomato,” the 
researchers concluded, “had little effect on the proliferation of the tumour cell 
lines.”63 
The single most effective vegetable was garlic, which came in first against breast 
cancer, both child and adult brain cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate 
cancer, and stomach cancer, and second after leeks against kidney cancer. So might I 
suggest a garlicky salad dressing like the one here? 
Garlic and Onions 
As the above salad example illustrates, garlic, onions, leeks, and other vegetables in 
the allium family appear to have special properties. Wait a second, though. Like 
chemotherapy, maybe garlic isn’t just toxic to cancer cells but toxic to all cells? That 
wouldn’t be good. Researchers also wondered about this, so they decided to 
compare the effects of garlic and other vegetables on the growth of both cancer cells 
and normal cells. The same garlic dose that blocked nearly 80 percent of cancer cell 
proliferation appeared to have no effect whatsoever against normal cells, and similar 
results were found for the other allium and cruciferous vegetables. In other words, 
vegetables are selective; they destroy cancer cells but leave normal cells alone. 
These results were seen in a petri dish, though, and while such studies may have 
direct relevance for digestive-tract cancers that come in close contact with these 
foods, for these foods to be protective against other cancers, the anticancer 
compounds would have to be absorbed into the bloodstream. And in the case of brain 
tumors, the anticancer compounds would additionally have to cross the blood-brain 
barrier. The findings do seem to sync with other studies, though, both among human 
populations and in other laboratories, that corroborate the cancer-fighting benefits of 
cruciferous vegetables,64 garlic, and onions.65 Regardless, this study illustrates the 
dramatic differences between the biological capacities of individual vegetables and 
families of veggies and underscores the importance of including a variety of 
vegetables in your diet. 
Which Is the Best Cooking Method? 
Is it better to eat your vegetables raw or cooked? If you’re thinking raw, you’re right. 
But if you guessed cooked, you’re also right.66 Confused? Well, a number of 
nutrients, like vitamin C, are partially destroyed by cooking. For example, steamed 
broccoli may have about 10 percent less vitamin C than raw broccoli.67 If, however, 
you prefer cooked broccoli enough to eat seven florets of steamed rather than six 
florets of raw, then you just more than made up the difference. 
Other nutrients, however, actually become more absorbable after cooking. For 
example, you end up with more than six times the vitamin A in your bloodstream from 
cooked carrots compared to raw ones.68 A study of long-term raw foodists found 
surprisingly low blood levels of the red antioxidant pigment lycopene.69 It’s not what 
you eat but what you absorb, and cooked tomatoes appear able to better boost your 
lycopene levels.70 Steaming may also improve the bile acid–binding capacity of 
vegetables,71 which may help lower breast cancer risk.72 
Raw-food diets automatically eliminate most red- and yellow-light foods, which 
is not only an improvement over the standard American diet but also over many 
plant-based diets. There is no evidence to suggest, however, that eating raw foods 
largely or exclusively is healthier than eating a combination of cooked and raw 
whole plant foods. 
Some cooking methods, though, are preferable to others. Deep-fried foods, 
whether of plant origin (like french fries) or from animals (like fried chicken), have 
been associated with higher cancer risk.73 Deep-frying leads to the production of 
dangerous heterocyclic amines in meat (as detailed in chapter 11) and to acrylamide 
in deep-fried plant foods. The excess lifetime cancer risk attributable to the 
consumption of french fries in young children, for example, may be as high as one or 
two in ten thousand—meaning about one in ten thousand boys and girls eating french 
fries may develop cancer that would have otherwise not occurred had they not eaten 
french fries. The researchers urge deep-fryer cooking times and temperatures be set 
as low as possible “while still maintaining a tasty quality.”74 (They wouldn’t want to 
reduce cancer so much that the deep-fried foods wouldn’t be as tasty!) Blanching 
potatoes first can reduce acrylamide formation, but potato chip companies argue that 
this might have a negative impact on the “nutritional properties of the fried product,” 
because it would leach away some of the vitamin C.75 But if you’re relying on potato 
chips to get your vitamin C, acrylamide is probably the least of your worries. 
What is the best way to cook vegetables to preserve nutrition? I am often asked 
that question, and it’s difficult to answer, as it varies for different vegetables. What 
we would need is a study that measures a variety of different cooking methods with a 
variety of different vegetables. Thankfully, we got exactly that in 2009. A Spanish 
research team pulled out all the stops, performing more than three hundred separate 
experiments with twenty vegetables and six cooking methods, all while considering 
three different measures of antioxidant activity. They tested baking, boiling, frying, 
griddling (cooking in a thick frying pan with no oil), microwaving, and pressure- 
cooking.76 
Let’s start with the worst methods in terms of antioxidant loss: boiling and 
pressure-cooking. When you use these wet-cooking methods, some of the nutrition is 
lost into the cooking water, but less than I would have thought. For instance, the 
researchers found that boiling removes an average of 14 percent of the vegetables’ 
antioxidant capacity. So, if you like your corn on the cob boiled, you could just add 
an extra quarter ear to the pot. (Six quarters boiled may have all the antioxidant 
power of five quarters raw, baked, or microwaved.77) Of the six cooking methods 
studied, griddling and microwaving were actually the gentlest. Nuking your veggies 
appears to preserve, on average, more than 95 percent of antioxidant capacity.78 
Those are averages across twenty vegetables, however. Some vegetables are 
more resistant, and antioxidant power actually increases with cooking in some 
veggies. Which do you think was the most vulnerable vegetable—that is, the one 
probably best eaten raw? If you guessed bell peppers, you’re right. They’ve been 
shown to lose up to 70 percent of their antioxidant capacity when baked in an oven. 
I’m going to continue to roast my peppers because of how much I love the taste, but I 
realize I’m getting less nutritional bang for my buck. (No biggie, though, because I 
can just add an extra sprinkle of oregano to my roasted red pepper pasta sauce.) 
On the other hand, three vegetables hardly seem to be affected at all by cooking: 
artichokes, beets, and onions. You can even boil them, and they’ll still retain 97.5 
percent of their antioxidant power. 
Finally, there are two vegetables that may actually become healthier through 
cooking: the humble carrot and the celery stalk. No matter how you prepare them— 
even by boiling—carrots and celery appear to gain in antioxidant power. Green 
beans get an honorable mention, because they increase in antioxidant power when 
cooked by all methods except boiling or pressure-cooking. Microwaved green beans, 
for example, have more antioxidants than raw. So go ahead and make a nice 
vegetable soup and boost the ingredients’ antioxidant content at the same time. 
How to Make Your Own Fruit and Vegetable Wash 
Buying organic foods reduces your exposure to pesticides, but it doesn’t eliminate 
them entirely. Pesticide residues have been detected in 11 percent of organic crop 
samples due to accidental or fraudulent use, cross-contamination from neighboring 
nonorganic fields, or the lingering presence of persistent pollutants like DDT in the 
soil.79 
There are many commercial fruit and vegetable wash products that purport to 
improve the removal of pesticides, but a variety have been tested and appear to be a 
complete waste of money.80 For example, Procter & Gamble had a product that 
claimed it was “proven to be 98% more effective than water in removing 
pesticides.” When it was put to the test, though, it did no better than plain tap water.81 
Rinsing produce under running water generally removes less than half of the 
pesticide residue.82 A fingernail-polish-remover acetone bath has been found to be 
more effective at removing pesticides,83 but of course I’m not advocating dunking 
your fruits and veggies in that! The goal is to make your tomato less toxic. 
One effective method is to use a 5 percent acetic-acid bath—in other words, plain 
white vinegar, which has been found to remove the bulk of certain pesticide 
residues.84 But 5 percent is full strength, and it would get expensive buying gallons of 
white vinegar just to wash your fruits and veggies. Unfortunately, a diluted white- 
vinegar bath only seems marginally more effective than tap water.85 
Thankfully, there is a solution that is both cheap and effective: salt water. A 10 
percent saltwater rinse has been found to work as well as full-strength vinegar.86 To 
make your own pesticide-reducing bath, add one part salt to nine parts water. Just 
make sure to rinse off all the salt before eating. 
Is Buying Organic Worth It? 
Stroll down the produce aisle of your grocery store. You’ll see lots of foods labeled 
“organic,” but what does that really mean? 
According to the USDA, organic farming practices preserve the environment and 
avoid most synthetic materials, including pesticides and antibiotics. Among other 
requirements, organic farmers must receive annual on-site inspections, use only 
USDA-approved materials, and not use genetically modified crops. In order to be 
counted in the $35 billion U.S. organic retail market, products receive a USDA 
organic stamp.87 
The fact is that being organic doesn’t mean a food is healthy. The organic food 
industry didn’t become so lucrative by selling carrots. For instance, you can now buy 
pesticide-free potato chips and organic jelly beans.88 There are even organic Oreo 
cookies. Junk food is still junk food, even if it was produced organically. The 
organic label cannot turn red lights green. 
Many are surprised to learn (I know I was!) that a review of hundreds of studies 
found that organic produce does not seem to have significantly more vitamins and 
minerals. Organic fruits and vegetables do, however, appear to have more 
nontraditional nutrients like polyphenol antioxidants,89 thought to be because 
conventionally grown plants given high-dose synthetic nitrogen fertilizers may divert 
more resources to growth rather than defense.90 This may be why, as we learned in 
chapter 4, organic berries appear to suppress cancer growth better than conventional 
berries in vitro. 
Based on its elevated antioxidant levels, organic produce may be considered 20– 
40 percent healthier, the equivalent of adding one or two servings’ worth to a five-a- 
day regimen. But organic produce may be 40 percent more expensive, so for the same 
money, you could just buy the extra servings’ worth of conventional produce. From a 
purely nutrients-per-dollar standpoint, it’s not clear that organic foods are any 
better.91 But people don’t just buy organic foods because they’re healthier—what 
about safety? 
Conventional produce appears to have twice the levels of cadmium, one of the 
three toxic heavy metals in the food supply, along with mercury and lead.92 The 
cadmium is thought to come from the phosphate fertilizers that are added to 
conventional crops.93 The greatest concern most people have about conventionally 
grown produce, though, is the pesticide residues. 
People not only tend to overestimate the nutritional benefit of organic food, they 
also overestimate the risks of pesticides.94 For example, surveys have found that 
many consumers erroneously believe that just as many people die from pesticide 
residues on conventional food as they do from automobile accidents,95 or that eating 
nonorganic produce is almost as bad as smoking a daily pack of cigarettes.96 This 
kind of thinking is dangerous, as it could lead to a decrease in overall fruit and 
vegetable consumption. 
If just half of the U.S. population were to increase fruit and vegetable 
consumption by a single serving per day, an estimated twenty thousand cancer cases 
might be avoided each year. This estimate was calculated using conventional 
produce, so the additional pesticide burden from all that extra produce might be 
expected to cause ten new cancer cases. On balance, the study suggested, if half of 
Americans ate one more serving of produce per day, we’d prevent 19,990 people 
from becoming cancer patients every year. Sounds good to me! 
Unfortunately, this paper was written by scientists-for-hire paid by conventional 
produce growers, so they had an incentive to exaggerate the benefits and downplay 
the risks.97 Nevertheless, I think the bottom line is sound. You receive tremendous 
benefit from eating conventional fruits and vegetables that far outweighs whatever 
little bump in risk you may get from the pesticides.98 But why accept any risk at all 
when you can choose organic? My own family buys organic whenever we can, but 
we never let concern about pesticides stop us from stuffing our faces with as many 
fruits and vegetables as possible.

At least half your plate should be filled with vegetables. Here’s a simple rule: 
Include vegetables in everything, and the more the better. Bean burritos are better 
than carnitas, but better still is a bean burrito with lots of veggies wrapped inside. 
Instead of spaghetti with marinara sauce, make it spaghetti with marinara sauce … 
and loads of veggies. Marinara is certainly better than Alfredo, but it’s even better 
still to go the extra veggie mile and heap on your favorite vegetables. 
 Flaxseeds 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Flaxseeds 
Golden or brown 
Serving Size: 
1 tablespoon ground 
Daily Recommendation: 
1 serving per day 
I have talked about the wonders of flaxseeds in a few of this book’s earlier chapters, 
including those on high blood pressure (chapter 7), breast cancer (chapter 11), and 
prostate cancer (chapter 13). Remember how flaxseeds apparently offer “miraculous 
defense against some critical maladies”? 
Okay, you’re convinced. But just where do you get flaxseeds, and how do you 
best use them? 
You can buy flaxseeds in bulk at natural foods stores for just a few dollars per 
pound. They come in nature’s finest packaging: a hard natural hull that keeps them 
fresh. However, Mother Nature packs them a little too well. If you eat flaxseeds 
whole, they’re likely to pass right through you without releasing any of their nutrients. 
So, for best results, first grind up the seeds with a blender or coffee or spice grinder, 
or buy them preground or “milled.” (The other option is to chew them really well.) 
Thanks to their antioxidant content, ground flaxseeds should last at least four months 
at room temperature.1 
Ground flax is a light, nutty powder that can be sprinkled on oatmeal, salads, 
soups—frankly, just about anything you’re eating. You can even bake with flax 
without damaging the lignans2 or omega-3 fatty acids3 (unlike flaxseed oil). During 
medical school, I used to make a few dozen flaxseed muffins at a time and put them in 
the freezer. Then I’d pop one in the microwave every morning before I ran out the 
door and get my daily flax fix while eating breakfast surreptitiously on the subway. 
Are Fruit-and-Nut Bars Fattening? 
There are a number of energy bars on the market containing only green-light 
ingredients, such as dried fruits, seeds, and nuts. People love them because they’re so 
easy to throw into a briefcase, backpack, or purse and eat as a convenient snack on 
the go. 
Dried fruits, seeds, and nuts are all nutrient-dense foods, but they’re also calorie 
dense. Might concentrating so many calories into such a small energy bar contribute 
to weight gain? To find out, Yale University researchers split about one hundred 
overweight men and women into two groups. All the participants ate their normal 
diet, but half were told to add two fruit-and-nut bars daily. After two months, despite 
the extra 340 calories a day from the bars, the fruit-and-nut bar group did not gain any 
weight.4 
Dried fruits and nuts appear to be so satiating that people feel full and 
unintentionally offset the calories elsewhere throughout the day. Studies on apple 
rings,5 figs,6 prunes,7 and raisins8 have found similar results. In the apple study, 
postmenopausal women who added two apples’ worth of apple rings to their daily 
diet for six months not only didn’t gain weight but experienced a whopping 24 
percent drop in their LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.9 (That’s nearly the effect you can get 
with some statin drugs!) In general, the 7 percent of Americans who average a 
tablespoon or more of dried fruit per day tend to be less overweight and less obese, 
and they have slimmer waistlines and less abdominal obesity than Americans who 
don’t eat as much dried fruit.10 
Of course, when shopping for energy bars, it’s imperative that you read their 
labels, as many brands have added sugars. Or you can just save yourself some money 
and choose good old-fashioned trail mix. Better yet, how about eating a piece of 
fresh fruit? Still, if the choice is between an energy bar and a candy bar as an 
afternoon snack, the choice is clear. 
Other Ways to Eat Flaxseeds 
When you’re not sprinkling ground flax on your cereal, salads, or soups or baking it 
into your muffins, there are plenty of other ways to get your daily serving of 
flaxseeds. There are a lot of convenient flax bars, crackers, and snacks on the market 
these days, a few of which even have all green-light ingredients. 
Honestly, it’s pretty easy to make your own flax crackers. Mix two cups of ground 
flaxseeds with a cup of water, add whatever herbs and spices you want, and then 
spread the dough thinly on a parchment- or silicone-lined baking sheet. Score the 
dough into thirty-two crackers and bake at 400°F for about twenty minutes. To flavor 
mine, I use a half teaspoon each of smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion 
powder, but you should play around until you find a (salt-free) spice profile you 
prefer. When cut into thirty-two pieces, each cracker meets your Daily Dozen serving 
requirement. 
I also use my trusty discount dehydrator to make raw flax crackers. All you do is 
mix a cup of whole flaxseeds with a cup of water along with flavorful ingredients 
like sun-dried tomatoes and basil. After it firms for about an hour and gets a jelly- 
like consistency, I spread it out thinly and dehydrate away. Give it a try! Dip your 
flax crackers in hummus or another bean dip for double check marks. Since you’re 
using whole flaxseeds, though, make sure to chew thoroughly for maximum benefit. 
Flaxseeds have a wonderful binding quality that makes them a great ingredient for 
thick, milkshake-like smoothies. Toss a tablespoon of ground flax into a blender with 
some frozen berries, unsweetened soy milk, and half a ripe banana or mango or a few 
dates for sweetness, and you have a delicious drink containing both classes of 
protective phytoestrogens—lignans in flax and isoflavones in soy. (See chapter 11.) 
Blend in some cocoa powder for a chocolate milkshake that could help improve your 
chances of both preventing and surviving breast and prostate cancers. 
This same binding quality makes flaxseeds a green-light thickener to replace 
cornstarch. I use flax to make my favorite quickie stir-fry sauce. I start with some bok 
choy and fresh mushrooms. The water clinging to the bok choy after it’s rinsed, along 
with the liquid that gets released from the mushrooms while cooking, is enough to 
flash-steam the veggies in a hot pan without any added oil. Once the bok choy is 
tender-crisp, I add a cup of water mixed with a tablespoon each of tahini, ground 
flaxseeds, and Asian black-bean garlic sauce, a fermented yellow-light condiment 
you can find in a jar at most large grocery stores. Once the sauce thickens, it’s ready 
for some fresh ground pepper (and hot sauce, if you’ve got that spicy tooth like I do) 
and … voilà! 
You can even use ground flaxseeds to replace eggs in baking. For each egg in the 
recipe, whisk one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds with three tablespoons of water 
until the mixture becomes gooey. Unlike chicken eggs, “flax eggs” are not only 
cholesterol-free but they’re also packed with soluble fiber to bring your cholesterol 
down11 instead of up. 
*   *   * 
It never ceases to amaze me how these tiny little seeds can pack such a health- 
promoting punch. With just a measly tablespoon a day and so many delicious, easy 
ways to incorporate ground flax into your sips and bites, there’s no reason you 
shouldn’t be able to tick this Daily Dozen check box every day. 
 Nuts and Seeds

Sometimes it feels like there just aren’t enough hours in a day to get everything done. 
So instead of trying to make your day longer, why not make your life longer by an 
extra two years? That’s about how long your life span may be increased by eating 
nuts regularly—one handful (or about a quarter of a cup) five or more days a week.1 
Just that one simple and delicious act alone may extend your life. 
The Global Burden of Disease Study calculated that not eating enough nuts and 
seeds was the third-leading dietary risk factor for death and disability in the world, 
killing more people than processed meat consumption. Insufficient nut and seed 
intake is thought to lead to the deaths of millions of people every year, fifteen times 
more than all those who die from overdoses of heroin, crack cocaine, and all other 
illicit drugs combined.2 
The Uses of Blended Nuts 
Nuts make for quick and delicious snacks on their own, but my personal favorite use 
for them is as green-light sources of fat to make rich, creamy sauces. Whether in a 
cashew Alfredo, a ginger-peanut sauce, or a tahini-based green goddess dressing, 
nuts and seeds can maximize nutrient acquisition by both improving absorption and 
increasing your total intake of vegetables by adding some creamy cachet. 
An often overlooked use for nuts is as a key ingredient in soups, such as African 
peanut stew. When blended and heated, cashews thicken to make an amazingly 
creamy soup base. Nut and seed butters also pair well with veggies and fruits. Most 
everyone loves the classic childhood pairings of peanut butter with celery or apples. 
One of my favorite treats is dipping fresh strawberries into a decadent chocolate 
sauce. All you need is a half cup of an unsweetened milk, one tablespoon of chia 
seeds, one tablespoon of cocoa, one teaspoon of almond butter, and sweetener to 
taste. (I use one tablespoon of erythritol, discussed here.) Mix all the ingredients, and 
heat until the almond butter melts and the sweetener dissolves. Pour into a bowl, 
whisk until smooth, and put it in the fridge to cool. The chia and fiber from the cocoa 
powder help it thicken into an indulgent delight. (You can grind up the chia seeds 
first, but I like the tapioca-like texture the little chia balls form.) 
Walnuts for the Win 
Which nut is healthiest? Normally, my answer is whichever you’re most willing and 
able to eat regularly, but walnuts really do seem to take the lead. They have among 
the highest antioxidant3 and omega-34 levels, and they beat out other nuts in vitro in 
suppressing cancer cell growth.5 But how do walnuts fare outside the laboratory in 
real life? 
PREDIMED is one of the largest interventional dietary trials ever performed. 
Interventional studies, if you remember, are those in which participants are 
randomized to different diets to see who fares better. This helps researchers avoid 
the problem of confounding variables when trying to determine cause and effect in 
cohort studies. For example, in major study6 after study7 after study,8 people who eat 
nuts tend to live longer and suffer fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease, and 
respiratory disease. There was a lingering question, though: Did these findings show 
causation or merely correlation? It could be possible, after all, that nut eaters also 
tend to have other healthy lifestyle behaviors. Maybe those who eat nuts are more 
likely to be, well, health nuts. On the other hand, if scientists randomly assign 
thousands of people to various levels of nut consumption and the nuttier group ends 
up the healthiest, we could have more confidence that nuts aren’t just associated with 
better health but actually cause better health. This is what PREDIMED ended up 
doing.9 
More than seven thousand men and women at high cardiovascular risk were 
randomized into different diet groups and followed for years. One of the groups 
received a free half pound of nuts every week. In addition to eating more nuts, they 
were told to improve their diets in other ways, such as eating more fruits and 
vegetables and less meat and dairy, but weren’t as successful at any of those other 
goals compared to the control group. Nevertheless, having a free half pound of nuts 
sent to them every week for four consecutive years did indeed persuade them to start 
eating more nuts.10 (It’s too bad the researchers couldn’t have slipped in a little free 
broccoli too!) 
At baseline, before the study even started, the thousands assigned to the nut group 
were already eating about half an ounce of nuts a day. Thanks to the ensuing freebies, 
they ended up bumping up their consumption to a whole ounce (about a handful). As a 
result, the study was able to determine what happens when people at high risk for 
heart disease following a particular diet eat an extra half ounce of nuts every day. 
With no significant differences in meat and dairy intake, there were no significant 
differences in saturated fat or cholesterol intake. So, unsurprisingly, there were no 
significant differences in their blood cholesterol levels or the subsequent number of 
heart attacks. However, the added-nuts group did end up having significantly fewer 
strokes. In a sense, all the dietary groups were eating stroke-promoting diets. People 
in all the groups had strokes after eating each of the diets for years—so, ideally, 
they’d instead choose diets that can stop or reverse the disease process rather than 
encourage it. But for those not willing to make major shifts in their diet, just the 
minor tweak of adding nuts appeared to cut stroke risk in half.11 Those in the extra- 
nut-eating group still had strokes, but only about half as many. If this works as well in 
the general population, eighty-nine thousand strokes a year would be prevented in the 
United States alone. That would be like ten strokes an hour, around the clock, 
prevented simply by adding about four walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts to the 
nation’s daily diet. 
Regardless of which group participants were assigned to, those eating more nuts 
each day had a significantly lower risk of dying prematurely overall.12 Those who 
consumed more red- and yellow-light sources of fat—olive oil or extra virgin olive 
oil—failed to have any survival benefit.13 This is consistent with the way Ancel 
Keys, the so-called father of the Mediterranean diet, viewed olive oil. He thought of 
its benefit more as a means of replacing animal fats—that is, anything to get people to 
eat less lard and butter.14 
Of all the nuts studied in PREDIMED, the researchers found the greatest benefits 
associated with walnuts, particularly for preventing cancer deaths.15 People who ate 
more than three servings of walnuts per week appeared to cut their risk of dying from 
cancer in half. A review of the scientific literature concluded that “the far-reaching 
positive effects of a plant-based diet that includes walnuts may be the most critical 
message for the public.”16 
The Power of a Pea-“Nut” 
Did you know that peanuts actually aren’t nuts? Technically, they’re legumes, but 
they’re often lumped together with true nuts in dietary surveys and studies, so it’s 
been hard to tease out their effects. Harvard University researchers worked to change 
that in the Nurses’ Health Study by specifically asking people about their peanut 
butter intake. They found that women at high risk for heart disease who ate nuts or a 
tablespoon of peanut butter five or more days a week appeared to nearly halve their 
risk of suffering a heart attack compared to women who ate a serving or less per 
week.17 This cross-protection between true nuts and peanuts also appears to extend 
to fibrocystic breast disease. Adolescent girls in high school who consumed just one 
or more servings of peanuts a week appeared to have significantly lower risk of 
developing lumpy breasts, which can be a marker for increased breast cancer risk.18 
PB&J to the rescue! 
Nuts and Obesity: Weighing the Evidence 
Nuts and nut butters are packed with nutrition—and calories. For example, just two 
tablespoons of a nut or seed butter might contain nearly two hundred calories. 
Nevertheless, it’s probably better to eat two hundred calories of nut butter than two 
hundred calories of what most Americans would eat otherwise. Given how 
concentrated nut calories are—you’d have to eat nearly an entire head of cabbage to 
get the same amount—if you add a serving of nuts to your daily diet, won’t you gain 
weight? 
To date, there have been about twenty clinical trials on nuts and weight, and not a 
single one showed the weight gain you might expect. All the studies showed less 
weight gain than predicted, no weight gain at all, or weight loss—even after study 
subjects added a handful or two of nuts to their daily diets.19 However, these studies 
lasted just a few weeks or months. Perhaps prolonged nut consumption leads to 
weight gain? That question has been examined six different ways in studies lasting up 
to eight years. One found no significant change, and the other five measures found 
significantly less weight gain and reduced risk of abdominal obesity in those who ate 
more nuts.20 
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor 
destroyed. If calories, which are units of energy, can’t just disappear, then where are 
they all going? In one trial, for instance, participants who ate up to 120 pistachios as 
an afternoon snack every day for three months didn’t appear to gain a pound.21 How 
could thirty thousand calories vanish into thin air? 
One theory offered was dubbed the Pistachio Principle: Maybe nuts just take a lot 
of work to eat. Pistachios are typically bought in their shells, which slows 
consumption time, allowing your brain to better regulate your appetite.22 Sounds 
plausible, but what about shelled nuts like almonds and cashews? A study out of 
Japan did suggest that increasing “dietary hardness” (meaning chewing difficulty) is 
associated with a slimmer waist.23 Perhaps all that chewing simply tires you out? 
Then there’s the fecal-excretion theory. Many of the cell walls of chewed 
almonds, for example, remain intact in the gastrointestinal tract. In other words, it’s 
possible a lot of the calories in nuts just never get digested and wind up in your 
waste because you didn’t chew well enough. Both of these theories were put to the 
test by an international group of researchers who gave participants either a half cup 
of unshelled peanuts or a half cup of peanuts ground into peanut butter. If either the 
Pistachio Principle or the fecal-extraction theory were correct, the peanut-butter 
group would gain weight, since no calories would be left in undigested nuts, and no 
calories would be burned chewing. But in the end, neither group gained weight, so 
there must be another answer.24 
What about the dietary-compensation theory? The idea here is that nuts are so 
satiating and good at suppressing appetite that you end up eating less food overall. 
This could explain why some studies found that people lost weight after eating nuts. 
To test this idea, Harvard Medical School researchers gave two groups smoothies 
with the same number of calories, but one contained walnuts, and the other didn’t. 
Despite drinking the same amount of calories, the placebo (nut-free) smoothie group 
reported feeling significantly less full than the walnut group.25 So, yes—it does seem 
that nuts can make you feel fuller faster than some other foods. 
At this point, it looks as if 70 percent of nut calories are lost through dietary 
compensation and 10 percent are flushed as fat in your feces.26 But what about the 
last 20 percent? Unless all the calories are accounted for, you would still expect 
some weight gain. The answer appears to lie in the ability of nuts to boost 
metabolism. When you eat nuts, you burn more of your own fat. Researchers have 
found that while control-diet subjects were burning about twenty grams of fat within 
an eight-hour period, a group eating the same number of calories and fat, but with 
walnuts included in their diet, burned off more—about thirty-one grams of fat.27 If a 
pill could do that, drug companies would be raking it in! 
The bottom line? Yes, nuts are high in calories, but through a combination of 
dietary compensation mechanisms, your body’s failure to absorb some of the fat, and 
increased fat-burning metabolism, nuts can be a lifeline without expanding your 
waistline. 
Pistachio Nuts for Sexual Dysfunction 
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the recurrent or persistent inability to attain or maintain 
an erection for satisfactory sexual performance. It is present in up to thirty million 
men in the United States and approximately one hundred million men worldwide.28 
Wait a second. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world’s population 
yet up to 30 percent of the impotence? We’re number one! 
The reason may be due to our artery-clogging diet. Erectile dysfunction and our 
number-one killer, coronary artery disease, are actually two manifestations of the 
same disease—inflamed, clogged, and crippled arteries—regardless of which organs 
are affected.29 Not to worry, though, because Americans have red, white, and blue 
pills like Viagra … right? The problem is that these pills just cover up the symptoms 
of vascular disease and don’t do anything for the underlying pathology. 
Atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disorder that uniformly affects all major 
blood vessels in the body. Hardening of the arteries can lead to softening of the 
penis, since stiffened arteries can’t relax open and let the blood flow. Thus, erectile 
dysfunction may just be the flaccid tip of the iceberg in terms of a systemic 
disorder.30 For two-thirds of men showing up at emergency rooms with crushing 
chest pain, their penises had been trying to warn them for years that something was 
wrong with their circulation.31 
Why does atherosclerosis tend to hit the penis first? The arteries in the penis are 
half the size of the “widow-maker” coronary artery in the heart. Therefore, the 
amount of plaque you wouldn’t even feel in the heart could clog half the penile artery, 
causing symptomatic restriction in blood flow.32 This is why erectile dysfunction has 
been called “penile angina.”33 In fact, by measuring blood flow in a man’s penis with 
ultrasound, doctors can predict the results of his cardiac stress test with an accuracy 
of 80 percent.34 Male sexual function is like a penile stress test, a “window into the 
hearts of men.”35 
In medical school, we were taught the forty-over-forty rule: 40 percent of men 
over age forty have erectile dysfunction. Men with erection difficulties in their forties 
have a fiftyfold increased risk of having a cardiac event (like sudden death).36 
We used to think of erectile dysfunction in younger men (those under age forty) as 
“psychogenic”—meaning it’s all in their heads. But now we’re realizing that ED is 
more likely an early sign of vascular disease. Some experts believe that a man with 
erectile dysfunction—even if he doesn’t have cardiac symptoms—“should be 
considered a cardiac … patient until proved otherwise.”37 
The reason even young men should care about their cholesterol levels is because 
they predict erectile dysfunction later in life,38 which in turn predicts heart attacks, 
strokes, and a shortened life span.39 As one medical journal put it, the take-home 
message is that “ED = Early Death.”40 
What does this have to do with nuts? A clinical study found that men who ate three 
to four handfuls of pistachios a day for three weeks experienced a significant 
improvement in blood flow through the penis, accompanied by significantly firmer 
erections. The researchers concluded that three weeks of pistachios “resulted in a 
significant improvement in erectile function … without any side effects.”41 
This is not just a male issue. Women with higher cholesterol levels report 
significantly lower arousal, orgasm, lubrication, and sexual satisfaction. 
Atherosclerosis of the pelvic arteries can lead to decreased vaginal engorgement and 
“clitoral erectile insufficiency syndrome,” defined as “failure to achieve clitoral 
tumescence [engorgement].” This is thought to be an important factor in female sexual 
dysfunction.42 We learned from the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study that eating just two 
handfuls of nuts weekly may extend a woman’s life as much as jogging four hours a 
week.43 So eating healthier may not only extend your love life but also your entire 
life. 
Why are beans, nuts, and whole grains so health promoting? Maybe it’s because 
they are all seeds. Think about it: All it takes for an acorn to explode into an oak tree 
is water, air, and sunlight. Everything else is contained within the seed, which 
possesses the entire complex of protective nutrients required to mature into a plant or 
tree. Whether you’re eating a black bean, a walnut, a grain of brown rice, or a 
sesame seed, in essence you’re getting the whole plant in a tiny little package. As two 
noted nutrition experts concluded, “[D]ietary recommendations should embrace a 
wide array of seeds as part of a plant-based dietary pattern…”44

Nuts may be the easiest and tastiest Daily Dozen check box to check off. For those 
with peanut or tree nut allergies, seeds and seed butters can often be used as safe 
alternatives. But what about nut consumption if you have diverticulosis? For fifty 
years, doctors have told patients with this common intestinal condition to avoid nuts, 
seeds, and popcorn, but when the issue was finally put to the test, it turns out these 
healthy foods actually appear to be protective.45 So diverticulosis shouldn’t stop you 
from meeting this Daily Dozen mark, either. This one simple and delicious act could 
add years to your life without adding on pounds. 
 Herbs and Spices 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Herbs and Spices 
Allspice, barberries, basil, bay leaves, cardamom, chili powder, cilantro, cinnamon, 
cloves, coriander, cumin, curry powder, dill, fenugreek, garlic, ginger, horseradish, 
lemongrass, marjoram, mustard powder, nutmeg, oregano, smoked paprika, parsley, 
pepper, peppermint, rosemary, saffron, sage, thyme, turmeric, and vanilla 
Daily Recommendation: 
¼ teaspoon of turmeric, along with any other (salt-free) herbs and spices you enjoy 
Here’s a simple tip: Use your senses to pick out healthy foods. There is a good 
biological reason you should be so attracted to the vibrant colors found in the 
produce aisle: In many cases, the colors are the antioxidants. You can figure out 
which of two tomatoes has more antioxidants just by looking at which has a deeper 
red color. Of course, the food industry tries to hijack this natural instinct for colorful 
foods with abominations like Froot Loops, but if you stick to green-light foods, you 
can let color guide you. The same is true, we’re now realizing, with flavor. 
Just as many of the plant pigments are beneficial, scientists are discovering that 
many of the flavor compounds in herbs and spices are powerful antioxidants as 
well.1 Guess where the antioxidant rosmarinic acid is found? What about cuminal, 
thymol, and gingerols? The flavors are the antioxidants. You can use this knowledge 
to help you make decisions at the grocery store. You can see that red onions have 
more antioxidants than white, and you can taste that regular onions have more 
antioxidants than mellower, milder Vidalia-type onions.2 
The bitter and pungent compounds in the cruciferous and allium families are 
thought to be responsible for their health benefits. Intense colors and intense flavors 
can be signs of intense benefit. For optimum health, you should try to eat both 
colorful and flavorful foods. Indeed, the dietary guidelines for a number of countries 
now specifically encourage the consumption of herbs and spices, not only as a 
substitute for salt but for the healthy properties they have in their own right.3 And on 
the top of my list of healthful herbs and spices is turmeric—a spice that is both 
colorful and flavorful. 
Why You Should Include Turmeric in Your Daily Diet 
In recent years, more than five thousand articles have been published in the medical 
literature about curcumin, the pigment in turmeric that gives it that bright yellow 
color. Many of these papers sport impressive-looking diagrams suggesting that 
curcumin can benefit a multitude of conditions with a dizzying array of mechanisms.4 
Curcumin was first isolated more than a century ago, yet out of the thousands of 
experiments, only a few in the twentieth century were clinical studies involving 
actual human participants. But since the turn of the century, more than fifty clinical 
trials have tested curcumin against a variety of diseases, and dozens more studies are 
on the way.5 
We have seen how curcumin may play a role in preventing or treating lung 
disease, brain disease, and a variety of cancers, including multiple myeloma, colon 
cancer, and pancreatic cancer. But curcumin has also been shown to help speed 
recovery after surgery6 and effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis better than the 
leading drug of choice.7 It also may be effective in treating osteoarthritis8 and other 
inflammatory conditions, such as lupus9 and inflammatory bowel disease.10 In the 
latest trial for ulcerative colitis, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind study found that more than 50 percent of patients achieved remission 
within just one month on curcumin compared to none of the patients who received the 
placebo.11 If you are as convinced as I am that you should include turmeric in your 
diet to benefit from its pigment curcumin, the next questions, then, are: how much do 
you eat, how do you eat it, and what are the risks? 
A Quarter Teaspoon of Turmeric Every Day 
Turmeric is potent stuff. If I took a sample of your blood and exposed it to an 
oxidizing chemical, researchers could quantify the damage it caused to the DNA in 
your blood cells with sophisticated technology that allows them to count the number 
of breaks in DNA strands. If I then gave you a single pinch of turmeric to eat once a 
day for a week, redrew your blood, and again exposed your blood cells to the same 
free radicals, you would see that with the tiny bit of turmeric on board, the number of 
cells with DNA damage could be cut in half.12 That’s not mixing turmeric with cells 
in a petri dish—that’s having you ingest the spice and then measuring the effects in 
your blood. And this was not some fancy curcumin supplement, not some turmeric 
extract. It was just the plain spice you can buy at any grocery store. And, the dose 
was tiny, about one-eighth of a teaspoon. 
Now that’s powerful! 
The doses of turmeric that have been used in human studies range from less than 
one-sixteenth of a teaspoon up to nearly two tablespoons a day.13 Few adverse 
effects have been reported even at high doses, but the studies typically have lasted 
only a month or so. We don’t know what long-term effects of high doses there may 
be. Because turmeric can have such powerful drug-like effects, until we have better 
safety data, I would not advise anyone to take more than the culinary doses that have 
a long-standing record of apparent safety. How much is that? Though traditional 
Indian diets can include up to about a teaspoon of turmeric daily, the average intake 
in India is closer to a quarter teaspoon a day.14 So that’s how much I recommend you 
get as part of your Daily Dozen. 
How to Eat Turmeric 
Primitive peoples often used spices in sophisticated ways. For instance, quinine from 
cinchona bark was used to treat the symptoms of malaria long before the disease was 
even identified, and the raw ingredients of aspirin have been used as a popular 
painkiller long before Mr. Friedrich Bayer came along.15 Over the last twenty-five 
years, about half of new drug discoveries have come from natural products.16 
There’s a plant in South Asia called adhatoda (adu, meaning “goat,” and thoda, 
meaning “not touch”—it’s so bitter even the goats won’t eat it). Its leaves are steeped 
with pepper to make a folk remedy effective for treating asthma. Somehow it was 
figured out what scientists didn’t discover until 1928: Adding pepper vastly boosted 
the plant’s antiasthmatic properties. And now we know why. About 5 percent of 
black pepper by weight is composed of a compound called piperine, which accounts 
for pepper’s pungent flavor and aroma. But piperine is also a potent inhibitor of drug 
metabolism.17 One of the ways your liver gets rid of foreign substances is by making 
them water soluble so you can pee them out. This black pepper molecule, however, 
inhibits that process, thereby boosting blood levels of the medicinal compounds in 
adhatoda—and it can do the same for curcumin in turmeric root. 
Within an hour of eating turmeric, curcumin appears in your bloodstream, but only 
in small traces. Why only scant amounts? Presumably, your liver is actively working 
to get rid of it. But what if you suppress that elimination process by eating some 
black pepper? If you consume the same amount of curcumin but add a quarter 
teaspoon of black pepper, the level of curcumin in your blood shoots up by 2,000 
percent.18 Even just the littlest pinch of pepper, just one-twentieth of a teaspoon, can 
significantly boost curcumin blood levels.19 And guess what is a common ingredient 
in many curry powders besides turmeric? Black pepper. Curry powder in India is 
also often served with a source of fat, which alone can enhance the bioavailability of 
curcumin seven- to eightfold.20 (Unfortunately, traditional knowledge appeared to fail 
here as to the best source of that fat. Indian cuisine employs a great deal of clarified 
butter, or ghee, which may explain the country’s relatively high rates of heart disease 
despite its otherwise relatively healthy diet.21) 
My favorite way to incorporate turmeric is to use fresh turmeric root. Any large 
Asian market should carry it in the produce aisle. It looks like skinny fingers of 
gingerroot, but when you snap it open, you are greeted by the most unreal, Day-Glo, 
fluorescent-orange color. My quarter teaspoon of dried turmeric recommendation 
translates into about a quarter inch of fresh turmeric root. The roots are about two 
inches long, cost about ten cents each, and can last for weeks in the fridge or 
basically forever in the freezer. Every year you can go to the store and buy a twelve- 
month supply of fresh turmeric for about five dollars. 
There’s evidence to suggest that the cooked and raw forms may have different 
properties. Cooked turmeric appears to offer better DNA protection, while raw 
turmeric may have greater anti-inflammatory effects.22 I enjoy it both ways. I use a 
grater to add my daily quarter inch into whatever I may be cooking (or right onto a 
cooked sweet potato), or I throw a raw slice into a smoothie. You probably won’t 
even taste it. Fresh turmeric has a much more subtle flavor than dried, so it may be an 
especially good option for those who don’t like turmeric’s taste. You will see it, 
though. Be careful—it can stain clothing and surfaces. Turmeric may not just make 
your health golden but your fingertips, as well. 
Consuming turmeric with soy may offer a double benefit for osteoarthritis 
sufferers.23 Scrambled tofu is the classic turmeric-soy combination, but let me share 
two of my favorites: one raw and one cooked. You can whip up a pumpkin pie 
smoothie in less than three minutes. Simply blend a can of pumpkin purée, a handful 
of frozen cranberries and pitted dates, pumpkin pie spice to taste, a quarter-inch 
turmeric slice (or quarter-teaspoon of powder), and unsweetened soy milk to reach 
your preferred consistency. 
Another favorite is my pumpkin custard (aka crustless pie). All you need to do is 
blend one can of pumpkin purée with about ten ounces of silken tofu (the Mori-Nu 
brand is convenient because it stays fresh without refrigeration), as much pumpkin 
pie spice as you like, and one to two dozen pitted dates (depending on how much of a 
sweet tooth you have). Pour into a dish and bake at 350°F until cracks appear on the 
surface. By skipping the piecrust and sticking with a custard, you’re left with 
vegetables, tofu, spices, and fruit. The more you eat, the healthier you are. 
Fresh or powdered, turmeric is a natural flavor fit for Indian and Moroccan 
cuisines, but I add it to most anything. I find it pairs particularly well with brown rice 
dishes, lentil soup, and roasted cauliflower. Prepared yellow mustard typically 
already has turmeric in it for color, but try to find a salt-free variety—one that’s 
essentially just vinegar, a cruciferous vegetable (mustard seeds), and turmeric. I can’t 
think of a healthier condiment. 
What About Turmeric Supplements? 
Wouldn’t it be more convenient to just take a curcumin supplement every day? Added 
expense aside, I see three potential downsides. First, curcumin is not equivalent to 
turmeric. Supplement manufacturers often fall into the same reductionist trap as the 
drug companies do. Herbs are assumed to have only one main active ingredient, so 
the thinking goes that if you can isolate and purify it into a pill, you should be able to 
boost the effects. Well, curcumin is described as the active ingredient in turmeric,24 
but is it the active ingredient or just an active ingredient? In fact, it’s just one of 
many different components of the whole-food spice.25 
Few studies have compared turmeric with curcumin, but some that have suggest 
that turmeric may work even better. For example, researchers at the MD Anderson 
Cancer Center in Texas pitted both turmeric and curcumin against seven different 
types of human cancer cells in vitro. Against breast cancer, for instance, curcumin 
kicked butt, but turmeric kicked even more butt. The same was true against pancreatic 
cancer, colon cancer, multiple myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, and others— 
turmeric came out on top, above just its yellow pigment curcumin. These findings 
suggest that components other than curcumin can also contribute to anticancer 
activities.26 
Although curcumin is believed to account for most of turmeric’s health-promoting 
activities, research published over the past decade has indicated that curcumin-free 
turmeric—turmeric with the so-called active ingredient removed—may be as 
effective as or even more effective than turmeric with curcumin. There are 
turmerones, for example, in turmeric (but processed out of curcumin supplements) 
that may exhibit both anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. I naïvely assumed 
that the researchers who discovered this would advocate that people consume 
turmeric rather than take curcumin supplements, but instead, they suggested the 
production of all sorts of different turmeric-derived supplements.27 After all, who 
can make any money on a whole food that costs pennies a day? 
My second concern involves dosing. While the turmeric trials have used modest 
amounts that could conceivably be achieved through diet, curcumin-only trials have 
tested the amount of curcumin found in entire cupfuls of turmeric spice—one hundred 
times more than what curry lovers have been eating for centuries.28 Some 
supplements add black pepper as well, potentially boosting levels to the equivalent 
of twenty-nine cups a day of turmeric, which might result in enough curcumin in the 
blood to potentially cause DNA damage based on in vitro data.29 
Finally, there is a concern about contamination with toxic metals, such as arsenic, 
cadmium, and lead. None of the tested samples of powdered turmeric on the U.S. 
market has been found to be contaminated with heavy metals, but the same cannot be 
said of curcumin supplements.30 
None of these concerns (except cost) applies to supplements containing only 
whole ground turmeric powder. Nearly all turmeric supplements are extracts, 
however. How else could they get away with selling a small bottle of pills for twenty 
dollars when the bulk spice may be less than twenty dollars a pound? A bottle might 
last two or three months. For the same price, bulk turmeric could offer two or three 
years’ worth at Daily Dozen dosing. 
One compromise between convenience and cost may be to make your own 
turmeric capsules. There are capsule-stuffing gadgets that allow you to fill your own. 
Given the cost discrepancy between bulk turmeric and supplements, such a gadget 
would probably pay for itself after your first batch. A “00”-sized capsule would fit a 
day’s quarter-teaspoon dose. Making your own capsules might be a little time 
consuming, but if you won’t otherwise consume turmeric in your daily diet, it might 
be time well spent. If there were ever such thing as a magic pill, single-ingredient, 
ground turmeric root would probably come closest. 
Who Should Not Take Turmeric 
If you suffer from gallstones, turmeric may trigger pain. Turmeric is a 
cholecystokinetic agent, meaning it facilitates the pumping action of the gallbladder 
to keep bile from stagnating.31 Ultrasound studies show that a quarter teaspoon of 
turmeric causes the gallbladder to contract, squeezing out half of its contents.32 In this 
way, it may help prevent gallstones from forming in the first place. But what if you 
already have a stone obstructing your bile duct? That turmeric-induced squeeze could 
be painful.33 For everyone else, though, the effect of turmeric would be expected to 
reduce the risk of gallstone formation and ultimately even reduce the risk of 
gallbladder cancer.34 
Too much turmeric, however, may increase the risk of certain kidney stones. 
Turmeric is high in soluble oxalates, which can bind to calcium and develop into the 
most common form of kidney stone—insoluble calcium oxalate, which is responsible 
for about 75 percent of all cases. Those who have a tendency to form those stones 
should probably restrict consumption of total dietary oxalate to no more than 50 mg 
per day. This would mean no more than a teaspoon of turmeric daily at most.35 
(Turmeric, by the way, is considered safe during pregnancy, but curcumin 
supplements may not be.36) 
*   *   * 
My recommended daily quarter teaspoon of turmeric is in addition to whatever other 
(salt-free) herbs and spices you enjoy. The reason the Daily Dozen encourages herb 
and spice consumption in general and not just turmeric is not because they’re all 
interchangeable—turmeric appears to have unique benefits—but because there’s 
evidence other herbs and spices have health benefits as well. I’ve talked about the 
role of saffron, for example, in the treatment of Alzheimer’s (chapter 3) and 
depression (chapter 12). Spices don’t just make food taste better; they make food 
better for you. I encourage you to keep a well-stocked spice cabinet and make it a 
habit to add whatever herbs and spices you find appealing to any dish you might be 
eating. 
What follows here is a more in-depth examination of some of the herbs and spices 
for which we have the most scientific data. I will describe some of the fascinating 
studies that illustrate the benefits of these flavor boosters and explain some of the 
easiest ways to add them to your meals. 
Fenugreek 
Powdered fenugreek seed is a spice found commonly in Indian and Middle Eastern 
cuisines. Fenugreek appears to significantly improve muscle strength and weight- 
lifting power output, allowing men in training, for example, to leg press an extra 
eighty pounds compared to those ingesting a placebo.37 Fenugreek may also possess 
“potent anticancer properties” in vitro.38 I don’t like the taste of the powder, so I just 
throw in fenugreek seeds with my broccoli seeds when I’m sprouting. 
There is a side effect of fenugreek seed consumption, however: It can make your 
armpits smell like maple syrup.39 I kid you not. It’s a harmless phenomenon, but what 
isn’t harmless, however, is maple syrup urine disease, a serious congenital disorder. 
Breast-feeding infants with mothers who use fenugreek to boost their milk production 
may be misdiagnosed with this completely unrelated disorder.40 If you’re pregnant or 
breast-feeding and eating fenugreek, make sure to tell your obstetrician just so she or 
he doesn’t think your baby has maple syrup urine disease. 
Cilantro 
One sign of changing U.S. demographics is that salsa has replaced ketchup as 
America’s top table condiment.41 One popular salsa ingredient is cilantro, one of the 
most polarizing and divisive food ingredients known to humankind. Some people 
absolutely love it, and some people absolutely hate it. What’s interesting is that the 
lovers and the haters appear to experience the taste differently. Individuals who like 
cilantro may describe it as fresh, fragrant, or citrusy, whereas people who dislike the 
herb report that it tastes like soap, mold, dirt, or bugs.42 I’m not sure how people 
know what bugs taste like, but rarely are polarizing opinions about flavors so 
extreme. 
Different ethnic groups do seem to have different rates of cilantro dislike, with 
Ashkenazi Jews scoring among the highest on the cilantro hate-o-meter.43 Another 
clue came from twin studies that show that identical twins tend to share cilantro 
preferences, whereas fraternal twins do not have such a strong correlation.44 The 
human genetic code contains about three billion letters, so we’d have to analyze the 
DNA of roughly ten thousand people to find a cilantro gene. Obviously, genetic 
researchers have better things to do than undertake that challenge … right? 
Maybe not. Genetic studies of more than twenty-five thousand participants who 
reported their cilantro preferences discovered an area on chromosome 11 that 
seemed to be a match. What’s there? A gene called OR6A2 that enables you to smell 
certain chemicals like E-(2)-decenal, which is both a primary constituent of cilantro 
and a defensive secretion of stink bugs. So maybe cilantro does taste like bugs! 
Cilantro lovers may just be genetic mutants who have an inability to smell the 
unpleasant compound.45 
This may actually be an advantage, though, because cilantro is healthy stuff. 
Mother Nature has been described as the most comprehensive pharmacy of all time, 
and cilantro is one of her oldest herbal prescriptions.46 About twenty sprigs of 
cilantro daily for two months reduced inflammation levels in arthritis sufferers and 
cut uric-acid levels in half, suggesting that lots of cilantro may be useful for people 
suffering from gout.47 
Cayenne Pepper 
In a study published as “Secretion, Pain and Sneezing Induced by the Application of 
Capsaicin to the Nasal Mucosa in Man,” researchers found that if you cut a hot 
pepper and rub it inside your nostrils, your nose will start running and hurting, and 
you’ll start sneezing. (Capsaicin is the burning component of hot peppers.) Why 
would they perform such an experiment? People who have handled hot peppers know 
that if they get some up their nose, they can experience an intense burning sensation. 
(And it doesn’t even have to get up your nose, which I was chagrined to learn after I 
once failed to wash my hands before using the restroom!) However, the researchers 
noted that “these phenomena have not been investigated.” So they decided it 
“appeared worthwhile to study the effects produced by topical application of 
capsaicin in the human [nose]…”48 
The researchers enlisted a group of medical students and dripped some capsaicin 
in their noses. The students started sneezing, burning, and snotting, describing the 
pain at about eight or nine on a scale of one to ten. No surprise. But it gets a little 
more interesting. What happened when they repeated the experiment day after day? 
You’d think the students might be more sensitive to capsaicin, with their nose still 
irritated from the day before, causing even greater pain and discomfort, right? 
Actually, the capsaicin hurt less. By day five, in fact, it hardly hurt at all—they didn’t 
even get a runny nose anymore. 
Were the poor med students permanently numbed? No. After a month or so, the 
desensitization wore off, and they were back in agony whenever the researchers tried 
dripping capsaicin back in their noses. What was likely happening is that the pain 
fibers—the nerves that carry pain sensation—used up so much of the pain 
neurotransmitter (called substance P) that they ran out. Exposed day after day, the 
nerves exhausted their stores and could no longer transmit pain messages until they 
made more neurotransmitter from scratch, which takes a couple of weeks. 
How could this be exploited for medical purposes? There’s a rare headache 
syndrome called cluster headache, which has been described as one of the worst 
pains humans can experience. Few, if any, medical disorders are more painful. It’s 
nicknamed the “suicide headache” because patients have taken their lives because of 
it.49 
Cluster headaches are thought to be caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve in 
the face. Treatments involve everything from nerve blocks to Botox to surgery. But 
that same nerve goes down to the nose. What if you cause the whole nerve to dump 
all its substance P? Researchers tried the daily capsaicin experiment with cluster 
headache sufferers. Unlike the wimpy medical students who rated the nose burning as 
an eight or nine on the ten-point pain scale, those used to the violence of cluster 
headache attacks rated the pain caused by capsaicin at only a three or four. By day 
five, they too became desensitized to the pain of the capsaicin. What happened to 
their headaches? Those who rubbed capsaicin in the nostril on the side of the head 
where the headaches occurred cut the average number of attacks in half. In fact, half 
the patients were apparently cured—their cluster headaches were gone completely. 
All in all, 80 percent responded, which is at least equal to, if not better than, all the 
current available therapies.50 
What about other pain syndromes? Irritable bowel syndrome is thought to be 
caused by a hypersensitivity of the lining of the colon. How do you determine if 
someone’s gut is hypersensitive? Innovative Japanese researchers developed a 
device to deliver “repetitive painful rectal distention,” which is basically a half- 
quart balloon hooked up to a fancy bicycle pump that is inserted and inflated until you 
can’t stand the pain anymore. Those with IBS had a significantly lower pain 
threshold, significantly less “rectal compliance.”51 
So how about trying to desensitize the gut by depleting substance P stores? It’s 
bad enough to have to rub hot peppers up your nose, but where would you have to 
stick them for irritable bowel? Thankfully, researchers chose the oral route. They 
found that the enteric-coated capsules of red pepper powder were able to 
significantly decrease the intensity of abdominal pain and bloating, suggesting “a way 
of dealing with this frequent and distressing functional disease…”52 
What about red pepper powder for the pain of chronic indigestion (dyspepsia)? 
Within a month of taking about one and a half teaspoons’ worth of cayenne pepper a 
day, stomach pain and nausea improved.53 The frequently prescribed drug Propulsid 
(cisapride) worked almost as well as the red pepper powder and was considered 
generally well tolerated—until, that is, it started killing people. Propulsid was pulled 
from the market after causing fatal heart rhythms.54 
Ginger 
Many successful natural treatments start like this: Some doctor learns that a plant has 
been used in some ancient medical tradition and figures, “Why not try it in my 
practice?” Ginger has been used for centuries for headaches, and so a group of 
Danish physicians advised one of their migraine patients to give it a go. At the first 
sign of a migraine coming on, the patient mixed a quarter teaspoon of powdered 
ginger in some water and drank it. Within thirty minutes, the migraine disappeared. 
And it worked every time for her, with no apparent side effects.55 
This is what’s called a case report. Though they’re really just glorified anecdotes, 
case reports have played an important role in the history of medicine, from the 
discovery of AIDS56 to a failed chest-pain drug with a billion-dollar side effect— 
Viagra.57 Case reports are considered the weakest form of evidence, but that’s often 
where investigations begin.58 So the case report of successfully treating one migraine 
patient with ginger isn’t so much helpful in itself, but it can inspire researchers to put 
it to the test. 
Eventually, a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed 
comparing the efficacy of ginger for the treatment of migraine headaches to 
sumatriptan (Imitrex), one of the top-selling, billion-dollar drugs in the world. Just 
one-eighth of a teaspoon of powdered ginger worked just as well and just as fast as 
the drug (and costs less than a penny). Most migraine sufferers started with moderate 
or severe pain, but after taking the drug or the ginger, ended up in mild pain or were 
entirely pain-free. The same proportion of migraine sufferers reported satisfaction 
with the results either way. 
As far as I’m concerned, ginger won. Not only is ginger a few billion dollars 
cheaper, but it caused significantly fewer side effects. While on the drug, people 
reported dizziness, a sedative effect, vertigo, and heartburn, but the only side effect 
reported for ginger was an upset stomach in about one out of twenty-five people.59 (A 
whole tablespoon of ginger powder at one time on an empty stomach could irritate 
anyone, though,60 so don’t overdo it.) Sticking to one-eighth of a teaspoon is not only 
up to three thousand times cheaper than taking the drug, you’re probably less likely to 
end up as a case report yourself, like the people who have had a heart attack after 
taking sumatriptan for a migraine,61 or have died.62 
Migraines are described as “one of the most common” pain syndromes, affecting 
as much as 12 percent of the population.63 That’s common? How about menstrual 
cramps, which plague up to 90 percent of younger women?64 Can ginger help? Even 
just one-eighth of a teaspoon of ginger powder three times a day dropped pain from 
an eight to a six on a scale of one to ten, and down further to a three in the second 
month.65 And these women hadn’t been taking ginger all month; they started the day 
before their periods began, suggesting that even if it doesn’t seem to help much the 
first month, women should try sticking with it. 
What about the duration of pain? A quarter teaspoon of ginger powder three times 
a day was found to not only drop the severity of menstrual pain from about seven 
down to five but decrease the duration from a total of nineteen hours in pain down to 
about fifteen hours,66 significantly better than the placebo, which were capsules filled 
with powdered toast. But women don’t take bread crumbs for their cramps. How 
does ginger compare to ibuprofen? Researchers pitted one-eighth of a teaspoon of 
powdered ginger head-to-head against 400 mg of ibuprofen, and the ginger worked 
just as effectively as this leading drug.67 Unlike the drug, ginger can also reduce the 
amount of menstrual bleeding, from around a half cup per period down to a quarter 
cup.68 What’s more, ginger intake of one-eighth of a teaspoon twice daily started a 
week before your period can yield a significant drop in premenstrual mood, physical, 
and behavioral symptoms.69 
I like sprinkling powdered ginger on sweet potatoes or using it fresh to make 
lemon-ginger apple chews as an antinausea remedy. (Ever since I was a little kid, 
I’ve suffered from motion sickness.) There is an array of powerful antinausea drugs, 
but they come with a nausea-inducing list of side effects, so I’ve always striven to 
find natural remedies whenever possible for myself and for my patients. 
Ginger has been used for thousands of years in traditional healing systems. In 
India, it’s known as maha-aushadhi, meaning “the great medicine.” However, it 
wasn’t proven to reduce nausea until 1982, when it beat out Dramamine in a head-to- 
head test in blindfolded volunteers who were spun around in a tilted, rotating chair.70 
Ginger is now considered a nontoxic, broad-spectrum antiemetic (antivomiting agent) 
effective in countering nausea during motion sickness, pregnancy, chemotherapy, and 
radiation, and after surgery.71 
Try making my lemon-ginger apple chews: In a blender, liquefy one peeled lemon 
with a palm-sized “hand” of fresh gingerroot. Use the mixture to coat thin slices of 
four apples, and then place them in a dehydrator until they reach desired chewiness. I 
like them a little moist, but you can dehydrate them further to make lemon-ginger 
apple chips, which store longer than the chews. For me, a few pieces eaten about 
twenty minutes before travel works wonders. 
Note: Ginger is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but the maximum 
recommended daily dose of fresh ginger while pregnant is 20 grams (about four 
teaspoons of freshly grated gingerroot).72 Any more may have uterus-stimulating 
effects. Women using my apple chews recipe to combat morning sickness should 
spread out the four apples’ worth of chews or chips over several days. 
Peppermint 
Which herbs have the most antioxidants? The most antioxidant-packed herb is dried 
Norwegian bearberry leaf. (Good luck finding that!) The most antioxidant-packed 
common herb is peppermint.73 That’s why I add mint to my favorite hibiscus cocktail 
recipe (see here) and why I try to add it to food whenever possible. Mint is a 
traditional ingredient in Middle Eastern salads like tabbouleh, Indian chutneys, and 
Vietnamese soups and fresh summer rolls. I like to put it into anything chocolaty as 
well. 
Oregano and Marjoram 
Oregano is such an antioxidant-rich herb that researchers decided to test if it could 
reduce the DNA-damaging effects of radiation. Radioactive iodine is sometimes 
given to people with overactive thyroid glands or thyroid cancer to destroy part of 
the gland or mop up any remaining tumor cells after surgery. For days after the 
isotope injection, patients are so radioactive that they are advised not to kiss anyone 
or to sleep close to anyone (including their pets), and to maximize the distance 
between themselves and children or pregnant women.74 The treatment can be very 
effective, but all that radiation exposure appears to increase the risk of developing 
new cancers later on.75 Hoping to prevent the DNA damage associated with this 
treatment, researchers tested the ability of oregano to protect chromosomes of human 
blood cells in vitro from exposure to radioactive iodine. At the highest dose, 
chromosome damage was reduced 70 percent. The researchers concluded that 
oregano may “act as a potent radioprotective agent.”76 
Other petri-dish studies with oregano suggest anticancer and anti-inflammatory 
properties. In a comparison of the effects of various spice extracts—bay leaves, 
fennel, lavender, oregano, paprika, parsley, rosemary, and thyme—oregano beat out 
all but bay leaves in its ability to suppress cervical cancer cell growth in vitro while 
leaving normal cells alone.77 Of 115 different foods tested for anti-inflammatory 
properties in vitro, oregano made it into the top five, along with oyster mushrooms, 
onions, cinnamon, and tea leaves.78 
Marjoram is a closely related herb and also shows promise in laboratory studies. 
It appears to significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in 
vitro.79 None of these studies on oregano family herbs was done on people, though, 
so we have no idea how, if at all, these effects will translate to a clinical setting. One 
of the only randomized, controlled trials I’m aware of is a study of marjoram tea for 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The tea was purportedly used in traditional 
herbal medicine to “restore hormonal balance,” so researchers decided to put it to 
the test. They instructed women with PCOS to drink two cups of marjoram tea on an 
empty stomach every day for a month. Beneficial effects on hormone levels were 
observed, which, the researchers concluded, “may justify the improvement claimed 
by traditional medicine practitioners and patients.”80 
Cloves 
The most antioxidant-packed common spice is the clove.81 It has an exceptionally 
strong flavor, so try adding just a teensy pinch to anything you’d normally put 
cinnamon or ginger on. Ground cloves are great on stewed pears and baked apples, 
giving them a pleasant, mulled cider taste, and a mug of chai tea is a fantastic way to 
pack in a bunch of high-impact common spices at once. 
Amla 
The most antioxidant-packed uncommon spice is amla,82 which is powdered dried 
Indian gooseberry fruit. As a Western-trained physician, I had never heard of amla 
despite its common use in Ayurvedic herbal preparations. I was surprised to find 
four hundred articles on this lesser-known spice in the medical literature, and even 
more surprised to find papers with titles like “Amla … a Wonder Berry in the 
Treatment and Prevention of Cancer.” Amla is arguably the most important plant in 
Ayurvedic medicine, used traditionally as everything from a neutralizer of snake 
venom to a hair tonic.83 I eat it because it’s apparently the single most antioxidant- 
packed green-light food on Earth.84 
Using an argon laser, researchers can measure and track human carotenoid 
antioxidant levels in real time. The most important finding from this body of work is 
that antioxidant levels can plummet within two hours of an oxidatively stressful 
event. When you’re stuck in traffic breathing diesel fumes, deprived of sleep, or 
suffering from a cold, for example, your body starts using up some of its antioxidant 
stores. What may only take two hours to lose can take up to three days to build back 
up.85 
Even ordinary body processes, such as turning food into energy, can produce free 
radicals. This is okay as long as the food you eat comes prepackaged with 
antioxidants. But if it doesn’t—if you chug straight sugar water, for example—the 
level of free radicals and oxidized fat in your bloodstream rises over the next few 
hours, while vitamin E levels drop as your body’s antioxidant stores are expended.86 
If you were to eat the same amount of sugar in the form of an orange, though, you 
wouldn’t get a spike in oxidation.87 Researchers concluded: “This argues strongly for 
the need to include high antioxidant foods in each and every meal in order to prevent 
this redox [free-radical versus antioxidant] imbalance.”88 
The standard American diet (SAD) isn’t exactly antioxidant packed. Here is the 
antioxidant content (in modified FRAP assay daμmol antioxidant units) of some 
typical American breakfast foods: bacon (7) and eggs (8), a bowl of corn flakes (25) 
with milk (10), an Egg McMuffin (11), pancakes (21) with maple syrup (9), and a 
bagel (20) with cream cheese (4). A typical breakfast may average about 25 
antioxidant units.89 
Compare those to the smoothie I had for breakfast this morning. I started with a 
cup of water (0), a half cup of frozen blueberries (323), and the pulp of a ripe mango 
(108). I added a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds (8), along with a half cup of fresh 
mint leaves (33) and a palmful of bulk white tea leaves (103). (For more about tea 
leaves, see here.) While the typical SAD breakfast may give you only about 25 
antioxidant units, my breakfast smoothie offered more than 500. And, when I add the 
final ingredient, a single teaspoon of amla, I get an additional 753 antioxidant units. 
That’s about four cents’ worth of amla, and it just doubled the antioxidant content of 
my entire smoothie. Before I’ve even fully woken up, I’ve already consumed more 
than 1,000 antioxidant units. That’s more than the average person may get in an entire 
week. I could drink my smoothie and eat nothing but doughnuts for the rest of the 
week, and most people still wouldn’t catch up. Notice that even though I packed the 
blender with amazing foods like blueberries and tea leaves, fully half the antioxidant 
power came from that single, four-cent teaspoon of powdered gooseberries. 
You can buy amla online or at any Indian spice store. Ayurvedic herbal 
supplements are typically something you’d want to stay away from, as they have been 
found to be heavily contaminated with heavy metals,90 some of which are actually 
added intentionally.91 But none of the samples of powdered amla tested so far has 
been found to be contaminated. You can find whole Indian gooseberries in the frozen 
section of Indian grocery stores, but frankly, I find them inedible—astringent, sour, 
bitter, and fibrous all at the same time. The powder isn’t much tastier, but it can be 
disguised in something with a strong flavor, like a smoothie. Alternatively, you could 
pack amla into capsules like the turmeric. Whenever I’m out on the road on a 
speaking tour, I try to take daily capsules of turmeric and amla until I can get back 
home and wrest back control over my diet. 
Spice Mixes 
While there have been a considerable number of studies done with individual spices, 
few have looked at increasing spice consumption in general. One group at 
Pennsylvania State University did compare the effects of a high-fat chicken meal with 
and without a mixture of nine herbs and spices. Herbs and spices were chosen 
because, ounce for ounce, they have more antioxidants than any other food group (and 
because the study was funded by the McCormick spice company).92 
Unsurprisingly, the people in the spice group experienced a doubling of the 
antioxidant power in their bloodstreams compared to participants in the spice-free 
group. Remarkably, though, the spice group ended up with 30 percent less fat 
(triglycerides) in their blood after the meal and improved insulin sensitivity. The 
researchers concluded that “the incorporation of spices into the daily diet may help 
normalize postprandial [after-meal] disturbances in glucose [sugar] and lipid [fat] 
homeostasis [control] while enhancing antioxidant defense.” 
But why experience such disturbances in the first place? The study reminds me of 
those that show eating greens is particularly protective against cancer among 
smokers.93 That is, the take-home message shouldn’t be telling smokers to eat greens 
—it should be telling smokers to quit smoking. Of course, they could do both, which 
in the context of the spice study would mean adopting an antioxidant-rich, green-light 
diet, offering the best of both worlds. 
Some of my favorite spice mixes are pumpkin pie spice, curry powder, chili 
powder, Chinese five-spice powder, a savory Indian spice blend called garam 
masala, an Ethiopian blend called berbere, Italian seasoning, poultry seasoning, and 
a Middle Eastern blend called za’atar. Spice mixes are a convenient way to provide 
a balance of flavors while boosting the variety of your spice intake, but make sure to 
check that the mixes are salt-free. 
Is Liquid Smoke Safe? 
I don’t know how I lived so long without smoked paprika. I swear it tastes like 
barbecue potato chips. After I first discovered it, I became a smoked-paprika zealot 
and put it on almost everything, but now I reserve it mostly for greens and when 
toasting fresh squash and pumpkin seeds. (I’ll bet you aren’t surprised to learn that’s 
my favorite part of Halloween!) I was concerned there might be carcinogenic 
combustion products in smoked seasonings (similar to the benzo[a]pyrene found in 
cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust), but these compounds tend to be fat soluble. So 
when you smoke a spice or make a water-based solution like liquid smoke, the smoke 
flavor compounds are captured without capturing most of the smoke cancer 
compounds. The same can’t be said for smoked fatty foods. While you’d have to chug 
three bottles of hickory smoke flavoring to exceed the safety limit, a smoked ham or 
smoked turkey sandwich could take you halfway there, and a single barbecued 
chicken leg would take you over the top. Smoked fish, such as herring or salmon, 
appears to be the worst. One bagel with lox could take you ten times over the safety 
limit.94 
Some Risks to Spicing Up Your Life 
There are a few spices, however, of which you can have too much of a good thing. 
Take poppy seeds, for example. 
The opium poppy used to make heroin is the same opium poppy that produces the 
poppy seeds in muffins and bagels. The idea that poppy seeds could serve as the 
source of appreciable amounts of narcotics was not given much credence despite the 
existence of an old European custom recommending a poppy seed–filled pacifier to 
quiet a noisy baby.95 It wasn’t given much credence, that is, until a mother tried 
giving her six-month-old some strained milk in which she had boiled some poppy 
seeds with the very best intentions of helping the child sleep better. The baby stopped 
breathing—but luckily survived.96 
The cases of poppy seed overdose aren’t limited to children. There’s another case 
in the literature of an adult who felt “dim feelings in the head” after eating spaghetti 
with a half cup of poppy seeds on top.97 So what’s the upper limit of poppy seed 
consumption that’s probably safe? Based on median morphine levels,98 about one 
teaspoon for every ten pounds of body weight. This means that someone weighing 
about 150 pounds should probably eat no more than five tablespoons of raw poppy 
seeds at a time.99 
Cooking may wipe out half of the morphine and codeine contained naturally in 
poppy seeds, which gives you some more leeway when baking.100 Soaking the poppy 
seeds for five minutes and then discarding the water before adding the seeds to your 
recipe can eliminate half of that remaining, if you’re making some poppy seed–filled 
pastry or other baked goods for children. Otherwise, there shouldn’t be any risk at 
usual levels of intake—unless you’re going in for a drug test, in which case you may 
want to avoid poppy seeds altogether.101 
Too much nutmeg can also be a problem. A paper entitled “Christmas 
Gingerbread … and Christmas Cheer: Review of the Potential Role of Mood 
Elevating Amphetamine-like Compounds…” suggested that certain natural 
constituents of spices like nutmeg may form amphetamine compounds within the body 
sufficient “to elevate the mood and to help provide some added Christmas cheer” 
during the holiday season.102 
This hypothetical risk was raised as far back as the 1960s in the New England 
Journal of Medicine in an article called “Nutmeg Intoxication.”103 The paper 
pondered whether the age-old custom of adding nutmeg to eggnog arose from the 
“psychopharmacological effect” described in cases of nutmeg intoxication. Such 
cases evidently go back to the 1500s, when nutmeg was used as an abortifacient to 
induce a miscarriage.104 In the 1960s, the spice was used as a psychotropic drug.105 
During that decade, mental health professionals concluded that while nutmeg “is 
much cheaper for use and probably less dangerous than the habit-forming heroin, it 
must be stated that it is not free from danger and may cause death.”106 
The toxic dose of nutmeg is two to three teaspoons. I had assumed no one would 
ever come close to that amount unintentionally until I saw a report in which a married 
couple ate some pasta, collapsed, and were subsequently hospitalized. What had 
happened was a big mystery until the husband revealed that he had accidentally 
added one-third of a jar of nutmeg to the meal while cooking.107 That’s about four 
teaspoons of the spice. I don’t know how they could have eaten it! I imagine the poor 
wife was just trying to be polite. 
Another popular and powerful spice is cinnamon, which has been prized for its 
ability to lower blood sugar levels.108 It works so well that you can even “cheat” on 
a diabetes test by consuming two teaspoons of cinnamon the night before. Twelve 
hours later, your blood sugar spike in response to meals will still be significantly 
dampened.109 Even just a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference.110 
Unfortunately, cinnamon can no longer be considered a safe and effective treatment 
for diabetes. 
There are two main types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon and cassia cinnamon 
(also known as Chinese cinnamon). In the United States, anything simply labeled 
“cinnamon” is probably cassia, since it’s cheaper. This is unfortunate, because cassia 
contains a compound called coumarin, which may be toxic to the liver at high doses. 
Unless it’s specifically labeled Ceylon cinnamon, a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon 
even a few times a week may be too much for small children, and a daily teaspoon 
would exceed the tolerable upper safety limit for adults.111 Can’t you just switch to 
Ceylon cinnamon and get the benefits without the risks? Without the risks, yes, but 
we’re no longer so sure about the benefits. 
Nearly all the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been 
performed with cassia. We’ve just assumed that the same would apply for the safer 
Ceylon cinnamon, but it was only recently put to the test. The nice blunting of blood 
sugars you see in response to cassia cinnamon disappeared when the researchers 
tried using Ceylon cinnamon instead.112 In fact, all along it may actually have been 
the toxic coumarin itself that was the active blood-sugar-lowering ingredient in the 
cassia cinnamon. Thus, sidestepping the toxin by switching to Ceylon cinnamon may 
sidestep the benefit. So, in a nutshell, when it comes to lowering blood sugars, 
cinnamon may not be safe (cassia), or it may be safe, but apparently not effective in 
reducing blood sugar (Ceylon). 
I still encourage Ceylon cinnamon consumption, given that it is one of the cheapest 
common food sources of antioxidants, second only to purple cabbage. But what’s a 
type 2 diabetic to do? Even the cassia cinnamon only brought down blood sugars 
modestly—in other words, it was only as good as the leading diabetes drug in the 
world, metformin, sold as Glucophage.113 Yes, cassia cinnamon may work as 
effectively as the leading drug, but that’s not saying much. The best way to treat 
diabetes is to attempt to cure it entirely with a healthy diet. (See chapter 6.)

Who knew that the herbs and spices you’ve been tossing into sauces and sprinkling 
onto dishes could have such impacts on your health? Work your creativity in the 
kitchen and spice up your meals and drinks to make them more flavorful and more 
healthful—but don’t forget the quarter teaspoon of daily turmeric. I am sufficiently 
convinced by the available body of evidence to single turmeric out as something 
everyone should add to his or her daily diet. 
 Whole Grains 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Whole Grains 
Barley, brown rice, buckwheat, millet, oats, popcorn, quinoa, rye, teff, whole-wheat 
pasta, and wild rice 
Serving Sizes: 
½ cup hot cereal or cooked grains, pasta, or corn kernels 
1 cup cold cereal 
1 tortilla or slice of bread 
½ a bagel or english muffin 
3 cups popped popcorn 
Daily Recommendation: 
3 servings per day 
Consistent with recommendations from leading cancer1 and heart disease2 
authorities, I recommend at least three servings of whole grains a day. Harvard 
University’s preeminent twin nutrition studies—the Nurses’ Health Study and the 
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study—have so far accumulated nearly three 
million person-years of data. A 2015 analysis found that people who eat more whole 
grains tend to live significantly longer lives independent of other dietary and lifestyle 
factors.3 No surprise, given that whole grains appear to reduce the risk of heart 
disease,4 type 2 diabetes,5 obesity, and stroke.6 Eating more whole grains could save 
the lives of more than a million people around the world every year.7 
There are so many nutrition claims floating around the Internet that lack scientific 
backing, but a few especially persistent memes directly contradict the available 
evidence. When I see books, websites, articles, and blogs parroting claims like 
“grains are inflammatory—even whole grains,” I can’t help but wonder what 
alternate dimension the authors call home. 
Pick your indicator of inflammation. Take C-reactive protein (CRP), for instance. 
CRP levels rise within the body in response to inflammatory insults and are therefore 
used as a screening test for systemic inflammation. Each daily serving of whole 
grains is estimated to reduce CRP concentrations by approximately 7 percent.8 
Furthermore, there’s a whole alphabet soup of inflammation markers that appear to 
be improved by whole grains: ALT, GGT, 9 IL-6,10 IL-8,11 IL-10,12 IL-18,13 PAI-1,14 
TNF-α,15 TNF-R2,16 whole blood viscosity, and erythrocyte filtration.17 Or, as 
presented in less technical terms in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 
“Whole-grain intake cools down inflammation.”18 Even excluding heart disease and 
cancer, habitual whole-grain intake is linked to a significantly lower risk of dying 
from inflammatory diseases.19 
What About Gluten? 
You’ve probably heard about an autoimmune disorder called celiac disease, in 
which the consumption of gluten causes adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal 
problems. Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, including wheat, 
barley, and rye. Celiac disease is relatively rare, though, affecting less than 1 percent 
of the population.20 For the more than 99 percent of the rest of us who don’t have the 
disorder, is gluten okay or, indeed, health-promoting like other plant proteins? 
In 1980, researchers in England reported a series of women suffering from 
chronic diarrhea who were cured by a gluten-free diet, yet none of the women had 
evidence of celiac disease.21 They appeared to have some sort of non-celiac gluten 
sensitivity. At the time, the medical profession expressed skepticism that there was 
such a thing,22 and even now there are experts who question its existence.23 In fact, 
doctors commonly referred their patients claiming non-celiac gluten sensitivity to 
psychiatrists because they were believed to have an underlying mental illness.24 
The medical profession has a history of dismissing diseases as existing “just in 
your head.” Examples of these include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
ulcerative colitis, migraines, ulcers, asthma, Parkinson’s, Lyme disease, and multiple 
sclerosis. Despite resistance from the prevailing medical community, each one of 
these conditions has subsequently been confirmed as a legitimate disorder.25 On the 
flip side, the Internet is rife with unsubstantiated claims about gluten-free diets that 
have spilled over into the popular press, making gluten the diet villain du jour.26 
And, of course, the gluten-free processed food industry, today worth billions, has a 
financial interest in the public’s confusion.27 Whenever that much money is at stake, 
it’s hard to trust anyone, so as always, stick to the science. And what sort of evidence 
is there for the existence of a condition presumed to be so widespread? 
The first double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled gluten challenge was 
published in 2011. Patients complaining of irritable bowel–type symptoms who 
claimed they felt better on a gluten-free diet—despite not having celiac disease— 
were tested to see if they could tell if bread and muffins they were given contained 
gluten or were gluten-free. All the subjects started out gluten-free and symptom-free 
for two weeks, and then were challenged with one of the two types of bread and 
muffins. Even those who ate the gluten-free placebo products felt worse, meaning 
they started out on a gluten-free diet and continued on a gluten-free diet, yet they 
reported feeling crampy and bloated. This is what’s called the nocebo effect. The 
placebo effect takes place when you give patients something useless and they feel 
better; the nocebo effect occurs when you give someone something harmless and they 
feel worse. Nevertheless, the subjects who received actual gluten felt even worse. So 
the researchers concluded that non-celiac gluten intolerance may indeed exist.28 
However, this was a small study, and even though the researchers claimed the 
gluten-free products were indistinguishable from those containing gluten, it’s 
possible that the patients were able to tell which foods were which. So, in 2012, 
Italian researchers created a double-blinded test with 920 patients diagnosed with 
non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Each was given capsules filled with either wheat flour 
or a placebo powder. More than two-thirds failed the test: Those on the placebo got 
worse, or those on the wheat felt better. But for those who passed, there was a clear 
benefit to staying on the wheat-free diet, confirming the “existence of non-celiac WS 
[wheat sensitivity].”29 Note that they said wheat sensitivity, though, not gluten 
sensitivity. In other words, gluten itself may not be causing gut symptoms at all. 
Most people who are sensitive to wheat are sensitive to a variety of other foods 
too. For example, two-thirds of people with wheat sensitivity have also been found 
to be sensitive to cow’s milk protein. Eggs appear to be the next leading culprit.30 If 
you put people on a diet low in common triggers of irritable bowel symptoms and 
then challenge them with gluten, there’s no effect, calling into question the existence 
of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.31 
Interestingly, despite being informed that avoiding gluten was apparently not 
helping their gut symptoms, many participants opted to continue following a gluten- 
free diet as they subjectively described “feeling better.” This led the researchers to 
wonder if avoiding gluten might improve the mood of those with wheat sensitivity 
and, indeed, short-term exposure to gluten appeared to induce feelings of depression 
in these patients.32 Regardless of whether non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a disease of 
the mind or the gut, it is no longer considered a condition that can be dismissed.33 
The next question, then, is what percentage of the population should avoid wheat 
and other gluten-containing grains? About one in one thousand may have an allergy to 
wheat,34 and nearly one in one hundred have celiac disease,35 which appears to be on 
the rise. Still, there’s less than a one-in-ten-thousand chance that an American will be 
diagnosed with celiac disease in a given year.36 Our best estimate for the prevalence 
of wheat sensitivity is in the same general range of celiac disease: slightly higher 
than 1 percent.37 So only about 2 percent of the population appears to have a problem 
with wheat, but that’s potentially millions of people who may have been suffering for 
years and could have been cured by simple dietary means, yet were unrecognized and 
not helped by the medical profession until recently.38 
For the 98 percent of people who don’t have wheat issues, there is no evidence to 
suggest that following a gluten-free diet has any benefits.39 In fact, there is some 
evidence suggesting that a gluten-free diet may adversely affect gut health in people 
without celiac disease, wheat sensitivity, or wheat allergy. A month on a gluten-free 
diet was found to adversely affect gut flora and immune function, potentially setting 
up those on gluten-free diets for an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in their 
intestines.40 This is due, ironically, to the beneficial effects of the very components 
wheat-sensitive individuals have problems with—such as the “FODMAP” fructans 
that act as prebiotics and feed your good bacteria, or the gluten itself, which may 
boost immune function.41 Less than a week of added gluten protein may significantly 
increase natural killer cell activity,42 which could be expected to improve the body’s 
ability to fight cancer and viral infections. 
The greatest threat gluten-free diets may pose, though, is that they may undermine 
our ability to diagnose celiac disease, the much more serious form of wheat 
intolerance. Doctors diagnose celiac by looking for the inflammation caused by 
gluten in celiac sufferers. But if patients complaining of digestive problems come to 
the doctor having already eliminated much of the gluten in their diets, physicians 
might miss the disease.43 Why would getting a formal diagnosis matter if you’re 
already on a gluten-free diet? First of all, it’s a genetic disease, so you’ll know to 
test your family. More significantly, though, many people on so-called gluten-free 
diets are not actually on truly gluten-free diets. Even twenty parts per million can be 
toxic to someone with celiac. Sometimes, even foods labeled “gluten-free” may not 
be safe for celiac sufferers.44 
What’s the best course of action to take if you suspect you might be sensitive to 
gluten? First off, do not go on a gluten-free diet. If you suffer from chronic irritable 
bowel–type symptoms, such as bloating, abdominal pain, and irregular bowel habits, 
ask your doctor about getting a formal evaluation for celiac disease. If you have 
celiac, then go on a strict gluten-free diet. If you don’t have the disease, the current 
recommendation is that you first try a healthier diet that includes more fruits, 
vegetables, whole grains, and beans, all the while avoiding processed foods.45 The 
reason people may feel better on a gluten-free diet—and therefore conclude they 
have a problem with gluten—is because they’ve suddenly stopped eating so much 
fast food and other processed junk. In other words, if you eat a deep-fried Twinkie 
and your stomach aches, it may not be the gluten. 
If a healthy diet doesn’t help, I suggest you try to rule out other causes of chronic 
gastrointestinal distress. When researchers have studied PWAWGs—that’s what 
they’re called in the medical literature: People Who Avoid Wheat and/or Gluten— 
they’ve found that about one-third of them didn’t appear to have gluten sensitivity but 
instead had other conditions like an overgrowth of bacteria in their small intestines, 
were fructose or lactose intolerant, or had a neuromuscular disorder like 
gastroparesis or pelvic floor dysfunction.46 After each of these is ruled out as well, 
then I’d suggest people suffering from chronic, suspicious symptoms try a gluten-free 
diet. 
No current data suggest that the general population should try to avoid gluten, but 
for those with celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a wheat sensitivity diagnosis, 
gluten-free diets can be a lifesaver.47 
Eat Whole … Within Minutes 
Eating whole grains should be more than just swapping out white bread for whole 
wheat and white rice for brown. There is a wonderful universe of whole grains out 
there. You may have tried quinoa, but what about kañiwa or fonio? Even wild rice 
(which is not actually even rice) may not sound as wild as the grain called freekeh. 
Have fun and try some amaranth, millet, sorghum, or teff to expand the amber waves 
of your horizon. Buckwheat is my mom’s favorite. 
As with vegetables, use color to make decisions at the grocery store. If you have a 
choice, pick red quinoa over white quinoa, blue corn over yellow, and yellow corn 
over white. Beyond just comparing antioxidant content, there’s experimental 
evidence to suggest that pigmented rice—red, purple, or black—has benefits over 
brown. For example, in addition to having about five times more antioxidants,48 
colored rice varieties have shown greater antiallergy activity in vitro,49 as well as 
superior anticancer effects against breast cancer50 and leukemia cells.51 
For convenience’s sake, there are a number of quick-cooking grains: amaranth, 
millet, regular oats, quinoa, and teff can all be prepared in less than twenty minutes. 
For grains that take longer, such as barley, farro, or steel-cut oats, consider cooking a 
big pot in advance on the weekend so you can simply reheat for your meals 
throughout the week. Or get a rice cooker—you can buy one for less than twenty 
dollars. 
Whole-wheat pasta cooks in about ten minutes. Improved production technologies 
have created a new generation of whole-grain pastas that no longer have the rough 
and mealy texture of yesteryear. My favorite brand is Bionaturae because of its 
deliciously nutty taste—try it with my Eight Check-Mark Pesto. 
Dr. Greger’s Eight Check-Mark Pesto 
2 cups fresh basil leaves 
¼ cup freshly toasted walnuts 
2 cloves fresh garlic 
¼ of a peeled lemon 
¼ teaspoon lemon zest 
¼ inch of fresh turmeric root (or ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder) 
¼ cup pinto beans 
¼ cup water or liquid from bean can 
1 tablespoon white miso 
Pepper to taste 
Combine all ingredients in a food processor. Blend until smooth. 
Scoop onto a cup and a half of cooked whole-grain pasta. 
Popcorn is a whole grain that takes less than five minutes to prepare. A hot-air 
popper is another inexpensive, useful appliance. There’s an endless variety of 
savory, sweet, and spicy toppings you can use. I like the combination of chlorella and 
nutritional yeast. (In my family, the green color earned it the name “zombie corn.”) 
By lightly misting air-popped popcorn with a spray bottle, you can get dry seasonings 
to stick. I like to spritz with balsamic vinegar. Be sure to stay away from artificial 
butter flavorings. Originally, we thought the artificial butter flavor chemical diacetyl 
was just an occupational health hazard, resulting in the deaths of workers who 
handled the chemical from a condition that became known as “popcorn lung.”52 Now 
we know consumers are also at risk, given a case series of serious lung disease 
thought to be caused by butter-flavored microwave popcorn consumption.53 
There are even one-minute whole-grain options: fully precooked bowls and 
pouches of brown rice and quinoa that can be microwaved and don’t even need to be 
refrigerated—just heat and eat. 
The Five-to-One Rule 
If you buy packaged grain products, anything labeled on the front with words like 
“multigrain,” “stone-ground,” “100% wheat,” “cracked wheat,” “seven-grain,” or 
“bran” is usually not a whole-grain product. They’re trying to distract you from the 
fact that they’re using refined grains. Here, color may not help. Ingredients like 
“raisin juice concentrate” are used to darken white bread to make it look healthier. 
Even if the first word in the ingredients list is “whole,” the rest of the ingredients 
could be junk. 
I suggest using the Five-to-One Rule. When buying healthier, whole-grain 
products, look at the Nutrition Facts label on the package and see if the ratio of grams 
of carbohydrates to grams of dietary fiber is five or less (see figure 7). For example, 
let’s see if 100 percent whole-wheat Wonder Bread passes the test: Per serving, the 
package lists 30 grams of carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber. Thirty divided by 3 is 
10. Well, 10 is more than 5, so the 100 percent whole-wheat Wonder Bread goes 
back on the shelf even though, technically, it’s a whole-grain product. Compare that 
to Ezekiel bread, a sprouted-grain bread based on a biblical verse. It has 15 grams of 
carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber, and, just like that, passes the test. So do Ezekiel 
english muffins, which taste great with fruit-only jam and nut butter. Though the 
science on the potential benefits of sprouted grains is still in its infancy, available 
data look promising.54 
Figure 7 
Apply the same Five-to-One Rule to breakfast cereals, another grocery category 
that can lull you into believing nearly everything is healthy. Multi-Grain Cheerios, for 
example, sounds good, but it has a ratio over 7. And then it just goes downhill from 
there with Frosted Cheerios and Fruity Cheerios, which have carbohydrate-to-fiber 
ratios that exceed 10. Compare that with Uncle Sam cereal, sliding in with a ratio 
under 4. Others that make the cut include some no-added-sugar puffed-grain cereals 
like puffed barley, but the healthiest whole grains are the least processed, the so- 
called intact grains. 
Even though wheat berries, shredded wheat, whole-wheat flour, and puffed-wheat 
cereal may all be 100 percent whole wheat, they are handled by the body very 
differently. When grains are ground into flour or puffed, they are digested more 
rapidly and more completely. This increases their glycemic index and leaves fewer 
leftovers for the friendly flora down in your colon. 
Researchers have experimented with this by splitting people into two groups. One 
group ate nuts, seeds, and beans more or less intact. The other group ate the same 
exact foods, but ground into flours and pastes. The first group ate nuts instead of nut 
butters, whole chickpeas instead of hummus, and muesli instead of muesli ground into 
a cream-of-wheat texture. Note that both groups were eating whole foods, just in 
different forms. 
What happened? The intact-whole-grain diet group doubled their stool size, 
which was significantly greater than that of the ground-whole-grain group, even 
though they were eating the same foods in the same quantities.55 How is that 
possible? There is so much more left over for your gut flora to eat when you eat your 
grains intact. Few people realize that the bulk of stool is not undigested food but pure 
bacteria—trillions and trillions of bacteria.56 That may be why you get an increase of 
nearly two ounces of stool for every one ounce of fiber you eat. That’s not just water 
weight—you’re feeding your good bacteria so they can be fruitful and multiply.57 
As the study demonstrated, when you eat grains intact, even if you chew your food 
thoroughly, pieces of whole seeds and grains transport starch and other goodies all 
the way down to your colon for your flora to feast on.58 But when grains are 
unnaturally processed into flour, almost all of the starch is digested in the small 
intestine, and you end up starving your microbial self. When that happens regularly, it 
can result in dysbiosis, an imbalance in which bad bacteria can take over and 
increase your susceptibility to inflammatory diseases or colon cancer.59 The moral of 
the story: Whole grains are great, but intact whole grains may be even better. 
Instead of a puffed brown-rice cereal, how about just brown rice? Brown rice for 
breakfast may sound weird, but warm bowls of grains are traditional breakfast foods 
in many parts of the world. There are savory versions, or you can sweeten it up with 
fresh, frozen, dried, or freeze-dried berries. There are online sites where you can buy 
freeze-dried strawberries in bulk for less than a dollar per cup. 
Oats 
Oatmeal, of course, is the classic whole-grain breakfast. Just as cruciferous 
vegetables and flaxseeds harbor beneficial compounds found in abundance nowhere 
else, oats contain a unique class of anti-inflammatory compounds called 
avenanthramides. They’re thought to be responsible in part for the fresh odor and 
flavor of oats60 as well as the ability of oatmeal lotion to relieve skin itching and 
irritation.61 Studies on human skin fragments from plastic surgery that were subjected 
to inflammatory chemicals reveal that oatmeal extract can suppress inflammation62— 
so much that oatmeal now appears to be the treatment of choice for certain serious 
chemotherapy-induced skin rashes.63 Ironically, two of the cancer cell lines found to 
be resistant to that type of chemotherapy64 were found to be sensitive to 
avenanthramides in vitro, suggesting that people should be applying oatmeal to their 
insides as well.65 Oatmeal is more than just a whole grain.66 
Oatmeal is my go-to breakfast when I travel. If there isn’t a nearby Starbucks 
where I can pick up some oatmeal, I prepare instant oatmeal with dried fruit in the 
coffeemaker in my hotel room. At home, if you want to spice up your oatmeal routine, 
Google “savory oatmeal” for all sorts of interesting dishes involving sautéed 
mushrooms, herbs, spinach, curry, roasted vegetables—you name it!

The Daily Dozen calls on you to eat three servings of whole grains a day. This might 
seem like a lot, but when you look at the actual size of those recommended servings, 
it’ll be a snap for you to succeed. Just one pasta dish at an Italian restaurant may 
average the equivalent of six servings!67 A morning oatmeal habit is a great way to 
kick-start your day, and then there are a variety of quick-cooking whole grains that 
serve as convenient, filling ways to fight chronic disease risk all day long. 
 Beverages 
Dr. Greger’s Favorite Beverages 
Black tea, chai tea, vanilla chamomile tea, coffee, earl grey tea, green tea, hibiscus 
tea, hot chocolate, jasmine tea, lemon balm tea, matcha tea, almond blossom oolong 
tea, peppermint tea, rooibos tea, water, and white tea 
Serving Size: 
One glass (12 ounces) 
Daily Recommendation: 
5 servings per day 
There are plenty of dietary guidelines for eating, but what about for drinking? The 
Beverage Guidance Panel was assembled to provide “recommendations on the 
relative health and nutritional benefits and risks of various beverage categories.” The 
panel included such heavyweights as Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the nutrition 
department at Harvard University School of Public Health and professor of medicine 
at Harvard Medical School. 
The panel’s nutrition experts ranked beverage categories on a six-tier scale from 
best to worst. Unsurprisingly, soda ranked last. Whole milk, meanwhile, was 
grouped with beer, with a recommendation for zero ounces a day. Their justification 
included concerns about links between milk and prostate cancer, as well as 
aggressive ovarian cancer, perhaps “related to its well-documented effect on 
circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1.” (See chapter 13.) Tea and 
coffee—preferably without creamer or sweetener—tied as the number-two healthiest 
beverages, second only to water, the top-ranked drink.1 
Water 
More than two thousand years ago, Hippocrates said, “If we could give every 
individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too 
much, we would have found the safest way to health.”2 Water is the healthiest 
beverage to drink—but how much is too little, and how much is too much? Water has 
been described as a “neglected, unappreciated and under researched” subject,3 but 
many of the studies extolling the need for proper hydration have been funded by the 
bottled water industry.4 It turns out the oft-quoted “drink at least eight glasses of 
water a day” recommendation actually has little underpinning scientific evidence.5 
The eight-a-day recommendation can be traced back to a 1921 paper in which the 
author measured his own urine and sweat output and determined he lost about 3 
percent of his body weight in water a day, which comes out to about eight cups.6 
Consequently, for the longest time, water requirement guidelines for humanity were 
based on just one person’s urine and sweat measurements. 
But now there’s actually extensive evidence suggesting that not drinking enough 
water may be associated with a variety of problems, including falls and fractures, 
heat stroke, heart disease, lung disorders, kidney disease, kidney stones, bladder and 
colon cancer, urinary tract infections, constipation, dry-eye disease, cavities, 
decreased immune function, and cataract formation.7 The problem with many of these 
studies, though, is that low water intake is also associated with several unhealthy 
behaviors, including low fruit and vegetable intake, more fast-food consumption, and 
even less “shopping at farmers markets.”8 And think about it—who drinks lots of 
water? People who exercise a lot. So perhaps it’s no wonder that heavy water 
drinkers have lower disease rates. 
Only large and expensive randomized trials could definitively settle these 
questions. But given that water cannot be patented, such trials seem unlikely.9 As a 
result, we’re left with studies that just link disease with low water intake. But are 
people sick because they don’t drink enough water, or are they not drinking enough 
because they’re sick? There have been a few large prospective studies in which fluid 
intake was measured before disease developed. For example, a Harvard University 
study of nearly forty-eight thousand men found that the risk of bladder cancer 
decreased by 7 percent for every extra daily cup of fluid consumed. A high intake of 
water—say, eight cups a day—may reduce the risk of bladder cancer by about 50 
percent, potentially saving thousands of lives.10 
Probably the best evidence we have for a specific recommendation for how much 
water you should be drinking comes from the Adventist Health Study. Twenty 
thousand men and women were studied. Those who drank five or more glasses of 
water a day had about half the risk of dying from heart disease compared to those 
who drank two glasses or less daily. About half of the cohort consisted of 
vegetarians, so they were also getting extra water by eating more fruits and 
vegetables. As in the Harvard study, this protection remained even after controlling 
for other factors, such as diet and exercise, suggesting that water indeed was the 
cause, perhaps by lowering blood “viscosity” (that is, by improving blood flow).11 
If protection against cancer and heart disease isn’t enough motivation, perhaps the 
prospect of being a better kisser will be. Brushing artificial skin against the lips of 
young women, researchers found that hydrated lips showed greater sensitivity to light 
touch.12 
Based on the best evidence to date, authorities from Europe, the U.S. Institute of 
Medicine, and the World Health Organization recommend about eight to eleven cups 
of water a day for women and ten to fifteen cups a day for men.13 These 
recommendations include water from all sources, though, not solely beverages. You 
get about four cups from the food you eat and the water your body actually produces 
on its own,14 so these guidelines roughly translate into a daily recommendation for 
drinking four to seven cups of water for women and six to eleven cups for men 
(assuming only moderate physical activity at moderate ambient temperatures).15 
You can also get water from all the other drinks you consume, including 
caffeinated beverages, with the exception of stronger alcoholic drinks like wines and 
spirits. Coffee,16 tea,17 and beer can leave you with more water than you started with, 
but wine actively dehydrates you.18 Note, though, in the cancer and heart disease 
studies mentioned earlier, the health benefits were almost exclusively associated 
with increased consumption of water, not other beverages. I address the problems 
with alcoholic drinks in chapters 8 and 11. 
Bottom line: Unless you have a condition like heart or kidney failure or your 
physician otherwise advises you to restrict your fluid intake, I recommend you drink 
five glasses of tap water a day. I prefer tap not only because it’s less economically 
and environmentally costly but because it may have less chemical and microbial 
contamination than bottled water.19 
Can Drinking Water Make You Smarter? 
Your brain is 75 percent water. 20 When you become dehydrated, your brain actually 
shrinks.21 How might this affect brain function? 
Based on urine samples obtained from groups of nine- to eleven-year-old kids in 
Los Angeles and Manhattan, nearly two-thirds of children may arrive at school in a 
state of mild dehydration,22 which may in turn negatively affect scholastic 
performance. If you take a group of schoolkids and randomly assign them to drink 
either one or zero cups of water before taking a test, guess which group does 
significantly better? The group given the water. These results, the researchers 
concluded, suggest that “even children in a state of mild dehydration, not induced by 
intentional water deprivation or by heat stress and living in a cold climate, can 
benefit from drinking more water and improve their cognitive performance.”23 
Your hydration status may also affect your mood. Restriction of fluid intake has 
been shown to increase sleepiness and fatigue, lower levels of vigor and alertness, 
and increase feelings of confusion. But as soon as study subjects are allowed to drink 
again, the deleterious effects on alertness, happiness, and clarity of thought are 
almost immediately reversed.24 Water absorption begins very rapidly, within five 
minutes from mouth to bloodstream, peaking around minute twenty.25 Interestingly 
enough, cold water gets sucked in about 20 percent faster than body-temperature 
water.26 
How can you tell if you’re dehydrated? Just ask your body. If you chug some 
water and pee most of it out soon after, this would be your body’s way of saying it 
was all topped off. But if you drink a bunch of water and your body keeps most of it, 
then your tank was running low. Researchers used this concept to develop a formal 
dehydration assessment tool: Empty your bladder, chug three cups of water, and then 
see how much you pee an hour later. They determined that if you drink three cups and 
urinate less than one cup within that hour, there’s a good chance you were 
dehydrated.27 
But you know, water can be so boring. So try adding fresh fruit or veggies as they 
do in fancy spas and upscale hotels. I like adding frozen strawberries in place of ice 
cubes. Sometimes I add a few drops of a potent juice concentrate, like tart cherry or 
pomegranate. Cucumber slices, ginger shavings, a cinnamon stick, lavender, and a 
mint leaf or two are also common refreshing additions. My latest favorite flavor 
fusions involve mixing tangerine slices and fresh basil or frozen blackberries and 
fresh sage. 
Bubbles! One of my colleagues at work has a SodaStream on his desk, and he 
makes his own sparkling water for about twenty-five cents a cup. In addition to 
making water more interesting, carbonation may also help relieve gastrointestinal 
symptoms. A randomized trial of the effects of sparkling versus still water found that 
drinking carbonated water may improve symptoms of constipation and dyspepsia, 
including bloating and nausea.28 
What if you took water and added beans or greens—that is, coffee beans or tea 
leaves? Wouldn’t you get all the water you need plus a bonus of additional nutrients? 
A cup of black coffee, tea, or herbal tea only has two calories, potentially offering 
nutrition at little caloric cost. Think of healthy beverages as the opposite of junk 
food: Junk food offers calories with scarce nutrition, whereas healthy beverages 
offer nutrition with scarce calories. But just how healthy are coffee and tea? 
Coffee 
I have already discussed the benefits of coffee for the liver (chapter 8), mind (chapter 
12), and brain (chapter 14). What about overall longevity? Do people who drink 
coffee live longer lives than people who don’t? 
The National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study, the largest-ever 
prospective study conducted on diet and health, put that question to the test. Yes, 
drinking lots of coffee is associated with a longer life, but the effect is relatively 
modest. People who drank six or more cups per day had a 10–15 percent lower 
mortality rate due to fewer deaths from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, 
injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections.29 However, when a study looked at 
people under the age of fifty-five, the opposite effect was found: Drinking more than 
six cups of coffee daily was found to increase the risk of death. “Hence,” the 
researchers concluded, “it may be appropriate to recommend that younger people, in 
particular, avoid heavy coffee consumption (less than 28 cups per week or less than 
4 cups in a typical day).”30 
The bottom line, based on all the best studies to date, is that coffee consumption 
may indeed be associated with a small reduction in mortality,31 on the order of a 3 
percent lower risk of premature death for each cup of coffee consumed daily.32 Don’t 
worry, it’s not “wake up and smell the coffee or don’t wake up at all”—the findings 
are less prescriptive than they are reassuring for those concerned about their coffee 
addiction. 
Coffee is not for everyone. For example, be careful if you have gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD). While a population study found no link between coffee 
consumption and subjective symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and 
regurgitation,33 scientists who actually stuck tubes down people’s throats to measure 
their pH found that coffee does seem to induce significant acid reflux, whereas tea 
does not. Caffeine does not appear to be the culprit, since caffeinated water doesn’t 
cause a problem. However, the coffee decaffeination process seems to reduce the 
level of whichever compounds are responsible, since decaf coffee appeared to cause 
less reflux. The researchers advised that people who suffer from GERD should 
consider switching to decaf or—even better—drink tea instead.34 
Daily coffee consumption is also associated with a slightly increased risk of bone 
fractures among women, but, interestingly, a decreased fracture risk among men.35 
However, no association was found between coffee and hip fracture risk. 
Conversely, tea may reduce hip fracture risk36 but appears to have no significant 
effect on fracture risk in general.37 This is an important distinction, because hip 
fractures are associated with a shortened life span more than other types of bone 
fractures.38 
People with glaucoma,39 or perhaps even with merely a family history of 
glaucoma,40 may also want to stay away from caffeinated coffee. Coffee intake is 
associated with urinary incontinence in both women41 and men.42 And there are case 
reports of individuals with epilepsy having fewer seizures after laying off coffee, so 
avoiding it is certainly worth a try for people with seizure disorders.43 Finally, it 
almost goes without saying that people who have trouble sleeping might not want to 
drink too much coffee. Just a single cup at night can cause a significant deterioration 
in sleep quality.44 
The mystery as to why some studies showed that coffee consumption increased 
cholesterol and others did not was solved when it was discovered that the 
cholesterol-raising compound thought to be responsible was fat soluble. The culprit 
compound, cafestol, is found in the oils of coffee beans that become trapped in the 
paper filter, so drip coffee doesn’t raise cholesterol as much as french press, boiled, 
or Turkish (“mud”-style) coffee. Neither the degree of roasting nor decaffeination 
appears to make a difference, though Robusta beans have less cafestol than Arabica 
beans. If you don’t have optimal cholesterol levels, you should consider sticking to 
filtered coffee or using instant coffee, which also lacks these compounds.45 If these 
tweaks don’t help, consider eliminating coffee completely, as even paper-filtered 
coffee may raise cholesterol levels a small amount.46 
We used to think caffeine might increase the risk of an irregular heart rhythm 
called atrial fibrillation, but this was based on anecdotal case reports involving the 
acute ingestion of very large quantities of caffeine47 (including a case blamed in part 
on a woman’s “chocolate intake abuse”).48 As a result, the erroneous notion that 
caffeine ingestion may trigger abnormal heart rhythms became “common knowledge,” 
an assumption that led to changes in medical practice. More recently, however, 
actual studies were performed that revealed caffeine intake does not appear to 
increase the risk of atrial fibrillation after all.49 Moreover, “low-dose” caffeine, 
which was defined as drinking fewer than about six cups of coffee a day, may even 
have a protective effect on heart rhythm.50 
Moderate caffeine consumption in healthy, nonpregnant adults is not only safe but 
has been found to increase energy and alertness and enhance physical, motor, and 
cognitive performance.51 Despite these benefits, one medical journal editorialized 
that doctors should “temper any message that suggests that caffeine is beneficial … 
given the proliferation of energy drinks that contain massive quantities of 
caffeine…”52 Indeed, drinking a dozen highly caffeinated energy drinks within a few 
hours could cause a lethal caffeine overdose.53 That said, drinking a few cups of 
coffee a day may actually extend your life a bit54 and even has the potential to slightly 
lower your overall cancer risk.55 
I cannot recommend drinking coffee, though. Why? Because every cup of coffee is 
a lost opportunity to drink a potentially even healthier beverage—a cup of green tea. 
Tea 
Black, green, and white teas are all made from the leaves of the same evergreen 
shrub. Herbal tea, on the other hand, involves pouring hot water over any plant in the 
world other than the tea plant. 
What’s so special about the tea bush? Phytonutrients exclusive to the tea plant 
appear so powerful that they can reverse disease even when merely applied to the 
skin. For example, the topical application of green tea in ointment form on genital 
warts results in an astounding 100 percent clearance in more than half the patients 
tested.56 It’s no wonder that this wonder treatment is now officially incorporated into 
the Centers for Disease Control STD Treatment Guidelines.57 There was even a 
remarkable case report of a woman whose skin cancers were apparently stopped 
with topical green tea application.58 If green tea can do that on the outside of your 
body, what might it be able to do internally? 
I already discussed the role green tea may play in breast cancer prevention in 
chapter 11. Drinking tea may protect against gynecological malignancies, such as 
ovarian cancer59 and endometrial cancer,60 as well as lower your cholesterol,61 
blood pressure,62 blood sugar,63 and body fat.64 It may protect the brain from both 
cognitive decline65 and stroke.66 Tea consumption is also associated with decreased 
risk of diabetes,67 tooth loss,68 and up to half the risk of dying from pneumonia.69 
Those who suffer from seasonal allergies may also benefit from drinking tea. 
Randomized trials have shown that drinking about three cups of Japanese Benifuuki 
green tea per day starting six70 to ten71 weeks before pollen season significantly 
reduces allergy symptoms. That’s nothing to sneeze at! 
Riding the Waves 
The invention of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brain-wave activity has 
been described as “one of the most surprising, remarkable, and momentous 
developments in the history of clinical neurology.”72 Scientists discovered that 
humans have four main mental states—two while sleeping and two while awake. 
Delta waves, in which your brain is electrically pulsing slowly at about one wave 
per second, are typically only seen in deep sleep. Then there’s theta-wave sleep. At 
about five cycles per second, this mental state occurs when you’re dreaming. The two 
waking states are alpha and beta. The alpha state is relaxed, aware, and attentive, 
such as when you close your eyes and meditate. Beta, meanwhile, is the stimulated, 
hustle-and-bustle state in which most of us live our lives. 
Alpha, however, is where you want to be—fully alert and focused, yet calm. How 
do you get there? If you relax in a pleasant, peaceful place, after about ninety minutes, 
you can start to generate some significant alpha activity (though such practicing 
meditators as Buddhist monks can achieve this state much earlier and maintain it even 
with their eyes open). To acquire this talent, you could meditate every day for a few 
years—or you could just drink some tea. Within minutes of tea consumption, anyone 
may be able to attain that same relaxed but alert brain-wave pattern.73 That dramatic 
alteration in brain activity may explain why tea is the world’s single most popular 
beverage after water. 
Both white and green teas are less processed than black tea and are probably 
preferable.74 White tea is made from young leaves and is named after the silvery- 
white hairs on the immature buds; green tea is made from more mature leaves. Which 
tea is healthier? The answer seems to depend on whether or not you add lemon. If 
you drink your tea without lemon, green tea appears preferable to white tea. But if 
you add lemon, white tea jumps ahead.75 The reason is that while there are more 
phytonutrients in white tea, they may only be released at a certain pH level.76 
In terms of cancer prevention potential, both green and white teas have been 
shown to protect against DNA damage in vitro against PhIP, the cooked-meat 
carcinogen I described in chapter 11. White tea won out, though, blocking upward of 
100 percent of DNA damage compared to green tea, which at the same concentration 
only blocked about half. The “potent antimutagenic activity of white tea in 
comparison with green tea” was achieved at a brewing time of one minute. For most 
of the teas tested, steeping longer than a minute had no additional effect. In terms of 
antioxidant activity, though, it may be better not to brew at all.77 
Cold-steeping is a popular way to prepare tea in Taiwan, especially during the 
summer months. Cold-steeped tea is not like conventional iced tea, in which you 
brew your tea hot and then cool it down. Rather, cold-steeping involves tossing the 
tea in cold water and letting it sit at room temperature or in the fridge for at least two 
hours. This method has been found to reduce the caffeine content and is said to 
reduce bitterness and improve the aroma.78 But what does cold-steeping do to the 
nutrient content? You would think that cold water wouldn’t draw out as many 
antioxidants. After all, nutrient extraction is presumably the whole point of brewing 
tea with hot water, right? A group of scientists took it upon themselves to compare 
the antioxidant activity of hot- versus cold-steeped tea. Essentially, they mixed LDL 
(“bad”) cholesterol with free radicals and timed how long it took the cholesterol to 
oxidize in the presence of both hot- and cold-steeped tea. 
In a surprise upset, cold-steeped white tea was significantly better at slowing 
down oxidation.79 (No significant effect of brewing temperature on the antioxidant 
activity of green tea was found.) The researchers surmised that traditional tea water 
is so hot that it manages to destroy some of the more sensitive antioxidants in white 
tea. I no longer brew my tea; I just let it sit overnight in the fridge. Cold-steeping 
saves prep time and energy, and may even be healthier. 
You don’t have to care how much nutrition is extracted from tea leaves, though, if 
you simply eat them. Matcha is powdered green tea, produced by milling whole tea 
leaves into a fine powder that can be added straight to water. Why waste nutrition by 
dumping a tea bag when you’re done, when you can drink the leaves instead? Think 
of it this way: Drinking steeped tea is akin to boiling a pot of collard greens and then 
throwing away the veggies and just drinking the cooking water. Sure, some of the 
nutrition leached into the water, but wouldn’t it be better to eat the leaves 
themselves? That’s why I now just throw whole tea leaves straight into my smoothies 
(see here). This is also a great way to incorporate tea in your diet if drinking tea on 
an empty stomach causes discomfort. If you develop a taste for matcha (I find it a bit 
grassy), you can carry around little packets of it wherever you go and just put some in 
your water bottle and shake. For essentially zero calories, you can drink dark-green 
leafies all day. 
If green tea is so good, why not just take green-tea extract pills? Because of 
dozens of reported cases of liver toxicity linked to their use80—yet another 
demonstration that it’s better to eat the whole food than some glorified “active 
ingredient” concentrate. There is one tea beverage I’d stay away from, though. Based 
on a few cases of serious, life-threatening outcomes linked to kombucha tea, a type of 
fermented tea, the consumption of kombucha “should be discouraged,” according to 
one case report of a person who ended up in a coma after drinking the stuff.81 
Are there any caveats to regular tea consumption? The fluoride content of tea 
appears to be the limiting factor. The tea plant naturally concentrates fluoride from 
the soil, which is one of the reasons tea consumption may help fight cavities,82 but 
too much fluoride can be toxic. A recent case reported in the New England Journal 
of Medicine described a woman who started experiencing bone pain after seventeen 
years of habitually consuming a pitcher of tea made from 100 to 150 tea bags daily.83 
That’s too much. 
To prevent skeletal fluorosis, adults should probably not drink more than about 
twenty tea bags’ worth of black tea a day for twenty years straight, or thirty bags of 
green daily, or eighty bags of white tea a day.84 To prevent dental fluorosis, a 
harmless but unsightly mottled tooth discoloration, children should probably refrain 
from drinking more than about three bags of black tea a day (or around four bags of 
green or twelve of white)85 while their teeth are still developing, up until around age 
nine.86 
The Best Sweetener 
In chapter 12, I shared research suggesting that adding sugar may negate some of the 
benefits of beverages, while adding artificial sweeteners like aspartame or 
saccharine may even make things worse. Are there any health-promoting sweeteners? 
The only two concentrated, green-light sweeteners may be blackstrap molasses and 
date sugar. Other natural caloric sweeteners, such as honey, less processed cane 
sugars, and maple, agave, and brown rice syrups don’t appear to have much to offer 
nutritionally.87 Date sugar is a whole food—just dried dates ground up into a powder 
—as are date and prune pastes, which can be homemade or purchased. These are all 
good options for baking, but for sweetening drinks, the taste of molasses may be too 
strong, and the whole-food sweeteners don’t fully dissolve. 
How about stevia? During the 1990s, research out of Japan found that steviosides, 
the “active” ingredient in stevia, appeared harmless. But in the guts of rats, intestinal 
bacteria transformed steviosides into a toxic substance called steviol, which can 
cause a big spike in mutagenic DNA damage in vitro.88 Unfortunately, it turns out that 
humans have the same bacterial activity in their guts.89 It’s the dose that makes the 
poison, though. The World Health Organization considers up to 1.8 mg of stevia 
compounds per pound of body weight to be a safe amount. Given the American sweet 
tooth, though, if we sweetened everything with stevia, you could exceed that safety 
limit. But just drinking up to two stevia-sweetened beverages a day should be 
considered harmless.90 
The sugar alcohols sorbitol and xylitol are harmless in themselves, but they aren’t 
absorbed by the body and end up in the colon, where they can draw in fluid and cause 
diarrhea. This is why they’re only used commercially in small quantities, such as in 
mints or chewing gum, as opposed to beverages. A related compound, however, 
erythritol, is absorbed and may have the harmlessness of xylitol without the laxative 
effect. 
Erythritol is found naturally in pears and grapes, but industrially, yeast is used to 
produce it. Erythritol doesn’t cause cavities,91 and it hasn’t been implicated in 
fibromyalgia,92 preterm birth,93 headaches,94 hypertension,95 brain disorders,96 or 
platelet disorders97 like other low-calorie sweeteners. Moreover, erythritol may 
actually have some antioxidant properties.98 As with any highly processed product, 
though, its utility should be confined to increasing your consumption of green-light 
foods. So, for example, if the only way for you to eat half a grapefruit is to sprinkle 
some sugar on it, then it’s probably better to eat a sugared grapefruit than no 
grapefruit at all—though sprinkling it with erythritol would be even better. With this 
logic in mind, I use erythritol to increase my consumption of cranberries (remember 
my Pink Juice recipe in chapter 8?), cocoa powder (see here), and hibiscus tea. 
My Hibiscus Punch 
In 2010, an antioxidant analysis of three hundred different beverages was published, 
examining everything from Red Bull to red wine.99 And the winner is … hibiscus tea! 
I documented its potent antihypertensive effects in chapter 7. I’ve always had 
“normal” blood pressure by U.S. standards, but I wanted to shoot for optimal, so 
hibiscus became a daily staple for me. Give this recipe a try: 
To eight cups of water, add a handful of bulk dried hibiscus or four bags of tea in 
which hibiscus is the first ingredient. Then add the juice of one lemon and three 
tablespoons of erythritol, and leave it in your fridge to cold-brew overnight. In the 
morning, strain out the hibiscus or take out the tea bags, shake well, and drink 
throughout the day. That’s something I try to do every day I’m home. 
For extra credit, add green foam: Pour a cup of the tea into a blender with a bunch 
of fresh mint leaves, blend on high, and enjoy. You end up with dark-green leafies 
blended into what may be the highest antioxidant beverage in the world, and it tastes 
like fruit punch. Your kids will love it! 
As with any sour food or beverage, make sure to rinse your mouth with water 
after consumption to prevent the natural acids from dissolving your enamel.100 Do not 
brush your teeth within an hour after eating or drinking something sour, as your 
enamel may be in a softened state and be further damaged by brushing.101 If you sip 
continuously throughout the day, I suggest using a straw to bypass your teeth.102 
Be careful, though. There are three ways that even harmless sweeteners could 
theoretically be harmful. Over the years, numerous large-scale studies have found a 
correlation between artificial-sweetener use and weight gain.103 The most common 
explanation for this counterintuitive finding is reverse causation: People aren’t fat 
because they drink diet soda; they drink diet soda because they’re fat. 
But there are at least three other less benign alternative explanations. The first is 
called “overcompensation for expected caloric reduction.” If you covertly switch 
people’s soda for diet soda without their knowing it, their caloric intake drops.104 
This makes sense, since they’re not drinking all that sugar anymore. But what if you 
fess up to what you did? People who knowingly consume artificial sweeteners may 
actually end up eating more calories; they may figure after their zero-calorie drink, 
they can indulge in that second piece of pie. Indeed that’s what studies have shown. 
For example, if you give subjects an aspartame-sweetened cereal for breakfast, but 
only inform half the participants that the sweetener was artificial, when lunchtime 
comes, the aspartame-informed group ends up eating significantly more than the 
aspartame-naïve group.105 I think of this concept anytime I see someone at a fast-food 
restaurant ordering a diet soda with their meal. 
A second explanation for gaining weight while using artificial sweeteners is 
based on how humankind evolved: When your brain registers the sensation of 
sweetness on your tongue, millions of years of evolution remind your brain to boost 
your appetite to eat as much as possible—after all, naturally sweet plant foods like 
fruits or sweet potatoes are among the healthiest. When you drink a can of diet soda, 
your brain thinks you just stumbled across a wild blueberry bush, and it sends urgent 
signals to eat large and eat fast before someone else gets wind of your bounty. At the 
same time, your body knows that if you eat too many calories, you might get too fat 
and not be able to outrun that saber-toothed tiger, so when your gut senses that you’ve 
absorbed enough calories, it sends signals up to your brain to urge you to stop eating. 
When you ingest low-calorie sweeteners, however, you experience the familiar 
hunger-boosting effect due to the sensation of sweetness on your tongue, yet you may 
lack the hunger-suppressing effect of calories entering your gut. The result can be a 
revved-up appetite that can lead to eating more food than you otherwise would 
have.106 That’s the second way diet soda could counterintuitively lead to weight gain. 
The third way involves maintaining cravings for, and dependency on, all things 
sweet. By continuing to consume any sweeteners—with or without calories—you are 
unable to train your flavor preferences away from intensely sweet foods.107 Let’s say 
that you use erythritol at home. That’s great, but what happens when you go on 
vacation and don’t have ready access to it? Your preference for intensely sweet food 
travels with you, and that may end up translating into the increased consumption of 
less-than-healthy foods. 
The bottom line? Erythritol seems safe, but only if you don’t use it as an excuse to 
eat more junk food. With great sweetness comes great responsibility.

More than two-thirds of American adults are overweight.1 Think about that. Fewer 
than one in three people maintain a healthy weight. What’s more, by 2030, more than 
half the country’s population may be clinically obese. Over the last three decades, 
childhood obesity has tripled, and most overweight kids will continue to be 
overweight into adulthood.2 As mentioned earlier, we may be in the process of 
raising the first generation of children in America with a shorter predicted life span 
than their parents.3 
The food industries like to blame inactivity as the prime cause of obesity, not the 
promotion and consumption of their calorie-rich products.4 On the contrary, however, 
research suggests that the level of physical activity may have actually increased in 
the United States over the past few decades.5 We know that obesity is rising even in 
areas where people are exercising more.6 This is likely explained by the fact that 
eating activity levels are outstripping physical activity levels.7 
Compared to eating habits in the 1970s, every day, children are consuming the 
caloric equivalent of an extra can of soda and small fries, and adults are eating an 
extra Big Mac’s worth of calories. Just to make up for the extra calories Americans 
are taking in compared to a few decades ago, as a nation, we’d need to walk an extra 
two hours a day, every day of the week.8 
Surveys suggest that most people believe controlling diet and getting enough 
exercise are equally important for weight control.9 It’s a lot easier to eat, however, 
than to move. To walk off the calories found in a single pat of butter or margarine, 
you’d have to add about an extra half mile to your evening stroll. For every 
additional sardine on your Caesar salad, that’s another quarter-mile jog. If you eat 
two chicken legs, you’ll need to get up on your own two legs and run three miles just 
to make up for it—and that’s stewed chicken, skin removed.10 
Researchers who accept grants from the Coca-Cola Company11 call physical 
inactivity “the biggest public health problem of the 21st century.”12 Actually, physical 
inactivity ranks down at number five in terms of risk factors for death in the United 
States and number six in terms of risk factors for disability.13 And inactivity barely 
makes the top ten globally.14 As we’ve learned, diet is by far our greatest killer, 
followed by smoking.15 
Of course, that doesn’t mean you should sit on the couch all day. As we’ve seen in 
this book, in addition to helping you enjoy a healthy body weight, exercise can also 
ward off and possibly reverse mild cognitive decline, boost your immune system, 
prevent and treat high blood pressure, and improve your mood and quality of sleep, 
among many other benefits. If the U.S. population collectively exercised enough to 
shave just 1 percent off the national body mass index (BMI), 2 million cases of 
diabetes, 1.5 million cases of heart disease, and up to 127,000 cases of cancer might 
be prevented.16 
Stand Up for Your Health 
It turns out your mom and dad were right about the hazards of watching too much 
television—although it may not rot the brain so much as the body. Based on a study of 
about nine thousand adults followed for seven years, researchers calculated that 
every additional hour spent watching TV per day may be associated with an 11 
percent increased risk of death.17 Screen time in general—including playing video 
games—appears to be a risk factor for premature death.18 So does that mean you 
have to kill your TV and PlayStation before they kill you? 
It’s not the electronics themselves but the sedentary behavior associated with 
enjoying them. Of course, not all sedentary behaviors are bad.19 Consider sleeping— 
you can’t be more sedentary than that! The problem appears to be sedentary sitting. 
After tracking the health of more than one hundred thousand Americans for fourteen 
years, an American Cancer Society study found that men who sit for six hours or 
more per day have a 20 percent higher overall death rate compared to men who sit 
for three hours or less, while women who sit for more than six hours have a 40 
percent higher death rate.20 A meta-analysis of forty-three such studies found that 
excess sitting was associated with a shorter life span,21 and this may be “regardless 
of physical activity level.” In other words, people who religiously hit the gym after 
work may still have shortened life spans if they are otherwise sitting throughout the 
day. Sitting for six or more hours a day appears to increase mortality rates even 
among people who run or swim for an hour a day, every day, seven days a week.22 
I’m not saying we should all quit our desk jobs, but there are other options. For 
instance, try switching to a standing desk, which elevates the heart rate and may burn 
as many as fifty extra calories per hour. This may not seem like a lot, but simply 
standing for three hours a day at work equates to about thirty thousand extra calories 
burned per year—the equivalent of running ten marathons.23 Whether you’re at the 
office, reading the newspaper at home, or, yes, even watching TV, why not find a 
way to stand while doing it? In fact, most of this book was written while I was 
walking fifteen miles a day on a treadmill underneath my standing desk. Prebuilt 
treadmill desks are expensive, but thrift stores are often awash with old exercise 
equipment. My treadmill “desk” is just a treadmill stuck under some cheap plastic 
shelving. 
If you have been sedentary for a long time, start out slowly. I’m sure you’ve heard 
the familiar refrain: “Before starting this or any other exercise program, be sure to 
check with your doctor.” This is definitely true for vigorous exercise, but most 
people can safely start to take up walking ten or fifteen minutes a few times a day. If, 
however, you are unsteady on your feet, prone to dizzy spells, or have a chronic or 
unstable health condition, it really is best to first consult with a health professional. 
What If You Really Have to Sit All Day? 
Why is sitting around so bad for you? One reason may be endothelial dysfunction, the 
inability of the inner lining of your blood vessels to signal your arteries to relax 
normally in response to blood flow. Just as your muscles atrophy if you don’t use 
them, “use it or lose it” may apply to arterial function as well. Increased blood flow 
promotes a healthy endothelium.24 Blood flow is what maintains the stability and 
integrity of the inner lining of your arteries. Without that constant tugging flow with 
each heartbeat of exertion, you can end up a sitting duck for arterial dysfunction 
diseases. 
What if sitting all day is part of your job? Research suggests treadmill desks may 
improve the health of office workers without detracting from work performance,25 
but your office might not accommodate a standing desk. Preliminary evidence from 
observational26 as well as interventional27 studies suggests that regular interruptions 
in sitting time can be beneficial. And they don’t have to be long. Breaks could be as 
short as one minute and not necessarily entail strenuous exercise—just walking up 
and down stairs may be enough. Another option at a sedentary workplace is to opt for 
“walking meetings” rather than traditional sit-downs. 
What if you have a sitting job in which you can’t take frequent breaks, like truck 
driving? Is there any way to improve your endothelial function sitting on your butt? 
First you need to get rid of any butts—cigarette butts, that is. Smoking a single 
cigarette can significantly impair endothelial function.28 Diet-wise, drinking green tea 
every two hours can help keep your endothelium functional,29 as can eating meals 
with greens and other nitrate-rich vegetables. (See chapter 7.) 
Turmeric may also help. One head-to-head study found that daily ingestion of the 
turmeric component curcumin can improve endothelial function just as well as up to 
an hour a day of aerobic exercise.30 Does that mean you can just be a couch potato as 
long as you eat curried potatoes? No, you still need to move around as much as 
possible—the combination of curcumin and exercise appears to work even better 
than either option alone.31 
Treating Sore Muscles with Plants 
Optimizing recovery from exercise is considered the holy grail of exercise science.32 
Anyone who works out regularly knows about sore muscles. There’s the burning 
sensation during strenuous exercise, which may be related to the buildup of lactic 
acid in your muscles, and then there’s delayed-onset muscle soreness, the kind you 
get in the days following extreme physical activity. Delayed soreness is likely the 
result of inflammation caused by microtears in your muscles and can adversely affect 
athletic performance in the days following a heavy workout. If you’re suffering from 
an inflammatory reaction, might anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help? The 
bioflavonoids in citrus can help with the lactic acid buildup,33 but you may need to 
ramp up to the anthocyanin flavonoids in berries to deal with the inflammation. 
Muscle biopsies of athletes have confirmed that eating blueberries, for example, 
can significantly reduce exercise-induced inflammation.34 Studies using cherries 
show that this anti-inflammatory effect can translate into faster recovery time, 
reducing the strength loss from excessive bicep curling from 22 percent down to only 
4 percent in male college students over the subsequent four days.35 The muscle- 
soothing effects of berries don’t only work for weight lifters; follow-up studies have 
shown that cherries can also help reduce muscle pain in long-distance runners36 and 
aid in recovery from marathons.37 
Eating two cups of watermelon prior to intense physical activity was also found 
to significantly reduce muscle soreness. The researchers concluded that functional 
compounds in fruits and vegetables can “play a key role in the design of new natural 
and functional products” like beverages, juices, and energy bars.38 But why design 
new products when nature has already designed everything you need? 
Preventing Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress 
As discussed in part 1, when you use oxygen to burn fuel in your body, free radicals 
can be produced, just as cars burning fuel produce combustion by-products out the 
exhaust. This happens even if you’re just idling, living your day-to-day life. What if 
you rev things up, start exercising, and really start burning fuel? Might you create 
more oxidative stress and therefore need to eat even more antioxidant-rich foods? 
Studies have demonstrated that ultramarathoners show evidence of DNA damage 
in about 10 percent of their cells tested during39 and up to two weeks following40 a 
race. But most of us aren’t ultramarathoners. Might short bouts of exercise still 
damage your DNA? 
Yes. After just five minutes of moderate or intense cycling, you can get an uptick 
in DNA damage.41 Never ones to miss an opportunity, pharmaceutical and 
supplement companies have investigated ways to block exercise-induced oxidative 
damage with antioxidant pills, but, ironically, this may lead to a state of pro- 
oxidation. For example, guys doing arm curls taking about 1,000 mg of vitamin C 
ended up with more muscle damage and oxidative stress.42 
Instead of using supplements, what about using antioxidant-rich foods to douse the 
free radicals? Researchers led subjects onto treadmills and cranked up the intensity 
until they nearly collapsed. While a spike in free-radical levels was witnessed in the 
control group, subjects who loaded up on watercress two hours before exercising 
actually ended up with fewer free radicals after the treadmill test than when they 
started. After two months of eating a daily serving of watercress, no DNA damage 
resulted, no matter how much it seemed the subjects were punished on the 
treadmill.43 So, with a healthy diet, you can get the best of both worlds—all the 
benefits of strenuous exercise without excess free-radical damage. As a review in the 
Journal of Sports Sciences put it, those who eat plant-based diets may naturally 
“have an enhanced antioxidant defence system to counter exercise-induced oxidative 
stress.”44 Whether it’s about training longer or living longer, the science seems clear. 
Your quality and quantity of life improves when you choose green-light foods. 
How Much Should You Exercise? 
The current official physical activity guidelines recommend adults get at least 150 
minutes a week of moderate aerobic exercise, which comes out to a little more than 
20 minutes a day.45 That’s actually down from previous recommendations from the 
surgeon general,46 the CDC, and the American College of Sports Medicine,47 which 
recommended at least 30 minutes each day. The exercise authorities seem to have 
fallen into the same trap as the nutrition authorities, recommending what they think 
may be achievable, rather than simply informing you what the science says and letting 
you make up your own mind. They already emphasize that any physical activity is 
better than none,48 so why not stop patronizing the public and just tell everyone the 
truth? 
It is true that walking 150 minutes a week is better than walking 60 minutes a 
week. Following the current recommendations for 150 minutes appears to reduce 
your overall mortality rate by 7 percent compared to being sedentary. Walking for 
only 60 minutes a week only drops your mortality rate about 3 percent. But walking 
300 minutes a week drops overall mortality by 14 percent.49 So walking twice as 
long—40 minutes a day compared to the recommended 20—yields twice the benefit. 
And an hour-long walk each day may reduce mortality by 24 percent!50 (I use 
walking as an example because it’s an exercise nearly everyone can do, but the same 
goes for other moderate-intensity activities, such as gardening or cycling.51) 
A meta-analysis of physical activity dose and longevity found that the equivalent 
of about an hour a day of brisk (4 mph) walking was good, but 90 minutes was even 
better.52 What about more than 90 minutes? Unfortunately, so few people exercise 
that much every day that there weren’t enough studies to compile a higher category. If 
we know 90 minutes of exercise a day is better than 60 minutes is better than 30 
minutes, why is the recommendation only 20 minutes? I understand that only about 
half of Americans even make the recommended 20 minutes a day,53 so the authorities 
are just hoping to nudge people in the right direction. It’s like the dietary guidelines 
advising us to “eat less candy.” If only they’d just give it to us straight. 
That’s what I’ve tried to do in this book. 
 Conclusion 
My friend Art was one of those guys you just wanted to be around. Successful, 
generous, kind, and hilarious, he was more than the public face of the natural foods 
business empire that he had started. He truly walked the walk, or rather, ran the run. 
An avid snowboarder and mountain biker, Art ate a whole-food, plant-based diet for 
more than two decades. He was one of the healthiest guys I ever met. 
He died while I was writing this book. 
At just forty-six years old, he was found dead in the shower of a health retreat he 
owned. My heart couldn’t deal with the grief of losing my friend, so my head took 
over, my mind spinning with possible causes of his death. I thought that if I could 
figure out what had happened, I could give his family some closure. 
I considered all the rare congenital heart disorders that can cause sudden death in 
young athletes. Maybe it was Brugada syndrome? I remembered there was a case of a 
marathon runner who had collapsed due to this rare genetic disorder,1 which can be 
triggered by heat.2 I looked it up, and indeed, there was a previous case tied to a hot 
bath,3 so it seemed plausible that this was what took Art’s life. 
The heat of the water was indeed the reason he’d died, but not in the way I had 
suspected. The sheriff called later that week to inform us that others had collapsed in 
the very same shower. These victims were medevaced to a nearby hospital and, 
thankfully, they survived. 
It turned out that Art had died of carbon monoxide poisoning. A newly installed 
hot-water heater must not have been vented properly. It was an unbearable tragedy. I 
haven’t been able to stop thinking about him. 
Art’s passing made me realize that no matter how well we eat or how well we 
live, we can always get hit by a bus—metaphorically or literally. We need to make 
sure to look both ways in life and before crossing the street. We need to take care of 
ourselves. We need to wear seat belts and bike helmets and practice safer sex. (After 
all, practice makes perfect!) 
And we need to make each day count by filling it with fresh air, laughter, and love 
—love for ourselves, for others, and for whatever we are doing with our one 
precious life. That’s what Art taught me. 
In Pursuit of Pleasure 
The idea of preventive health is that you do something now so that nothing bad 
happens later. You floss your teeth not because it makes you feel better but because, 
by doing so, one day you won’t feel worse. You could consider the healthy habits 
described in this book to be preventive—you eat a healthier diet now to avoid 
disease later. 
A healthy diet, however, does more than that. 
The food industries bank their billions by manipulating the pleasure centers within 
your brain, the so-called dopamine reward system. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter 
the brain evolved to reward you for good behavior, helping to motivate your drive 
for things like food, water, and sex—all necessary for the perpetuation of our 
species. This natural response has been and continues to be perverted for profit. 
The food industry, like the tobacco companies and other drug lords, has been able 
to come up with products that tap into the same dopamine reward system that keeps 
people smoking cigarettes and snorting cocaine. People have chewed coca leaves for 
at least eight thousand years without any evidence of addiction,4 but a problem arises 
when certain components are isolated and concentrated into cocaine—when the coca 
leaves are processed. The same may be true for sugar. After all, few people binge on 
bananas. The isolation of sugar from the whole food may be the reason you’re more 
likely to supersize soda than sweet potatoes or why you’re unlikely to eat too much 
corn on the cob but can’t seem to get enough high-fructose corn syrup. 
The overconsumption of sugar-sweetened foods has often been compared to drug 
addiction. Until very recently, this parallel was based more on anecdotal evidence 
than on solid scientific grounds. But now we have PET scans, imaging technology 
that allows doctors to measure brain activity in real time. It all started with a study 
that showed decreased dopamine sensitivity in obese individuals. The more the 
individual being studied weighed, the less responsive to dopamine he or she 
appeared to be.5 We see the same reduction in sensitivity in cocaine addicts and 
alcoholics.6 The brain gets so overstimulated that it ends up trying to turn down the 
volume. 
It was healthy and adaptive for our primate brains to drive us to eat that banana 
when there wasn’t much food around, but now that fruit is available in fruit loop 
form, this evolutionary adaptation has become a liability.7 The original Coca-Cola 
formulation actually included coca leaf, but now, perhaps, its sugar content may be 
the addictive stand-in. 
The brain responds similarly to fat. Within thirty minutes of being fed yogurt 
packed with butterfat, research subjects exhibited similar brain activity8 to those who 
drank straight sugar water.9 People who regularly eat ice cream (sugar and fat) have 
a deadened dopamine response in their brains when drinking a milkshake. It’s 
comparable to the way drug abusers have to use more and more drugs to obtain the 
same high. A neuroimaging study found that frequent ice cream consumption “is 
related to a reduction in reward-region [pleasure center] responsivity in humans, 
paralleling the tolerance observed in drug addiction.” Once you’ve so dulled your 
dopamine response, you may subsequently overeat in an effort to achieve the degree 
of gratification experienced previously, contributing to unhealthy weight gain.10 
What do fatty and sugary foods have in common? They are both energy dense. It 
may be less about the number of calories than their concentration. Consumption of 
green-light foods, which are naturally calorie dilute, doesn’t lead to a deadened 
dopamine response, but a calorie-dense diet with the same number of calories 
does.11 It’s like the difference between cocaine and crack: It’s the same stuff 
chemically, but by smoking crack cocaine, a user can deliver a higher dose more 
quickly to his or her brain. 
Given our new understanding of the biological basis of food addiction, there have 
been calls to include obesity as an official mental disorder.12 After all, both obesity 
and addiction share the inability to restrain behavior in spite of an awareness of 
detrimental health consequences, one of the defining criteria of substance abuse (a 
phenomenon referred to as the “pleasure trap”).13 Of course, redefining obesity as an 
addiction would be a boon to the pharmaceutical companies that are already working 
on a whole array of drugs to muck with your brain chemistry.14 
For example, when researchers tried giving an opiate blocker to binge eaters 
(similar to how heroin addicts are sometimes treated with opiate blockers to 
minimize the narcotic’s effects), the binge eaters ate significantly fewer fatty and 
sugary snacks—the snacks just didn’t seem to do as much for them when their opiate 
receptors were blocked.15 In addition to new drugs, addiction specialists have urged 
that the food industry “should be given incentives to develop low calorie foods that 
are more attractive, palatable and affordable so that people can adhere to diet 
programs for a long time.”16 No need—Mother Nature beat them to it. That’s what 
the produce aisle is for. 
Rather than taking drugs, you can prevent the numbing of your pleasure center in 
the first place by sticking to green-light foods. This can help return your dopamine 
sensitivity to normal levels so that you can again derive the same pleasure from the 
simplest of foods. When you regularly eat calorie-dense animal products and junk 
foods like ice cream, it’s not just your taste buds that change but your brain 
chemistry. After eating a bunch of candy bars, not only may a ripe peach no longer 
taste as sweet on your tongue but your brain down-regulates dopamine receptors to 
compensate for the repeated jolts of fat and sugar. In fact, an overly rich diet could 
cause you to experience less enjoyment from other activities as well. 
There is a reason cocaine addicts appear to have an impaired neurological 
capacity for sexual stimulation17 and why smokers have an impaired ability to 
respond to positive stimuli.18 Related brain circuits wire all these sensations. Since 
they all involve overlapping dopamine pathways, what you put into your body—what 
you eat and what you drink—can affect how you experience all of life’s pleasures. 
Try it and see. Try it and feel. 
Do you see where I’m going with this? 
Eating a whole-food, plant-based diet and returning your brain’s dopamine 
sensitivity to its healthy, normal levels can help you live life to the fullest and allow 
you to experience greater joy, satisfaction, and pleasure from all the things you do— 
not just what you eat. 
Let Me Help 
I hope I’ve been able to persuade you that nutrition is not the stale, lifeless subject 
your middle school home-economics class may have led you to believe. It’s vibrant 
and overflowing with opportunity for the betterment of your life. This abundance can 
create a problem, though. Over the last year alone, more than twenty-five thousand 
articles on nutrition were published in the medical literature. Who has time to sift 
through them all? 
Every year, my team and I read through every issue of every English-language 
nutrition journal in the world so you don’t have to. Then I compile all the most 
interesting, groundbreaking, and practical findings we can uncover to create new 
videos and articles every day for my nonprofit site, NutritionFacts.org. 
Everything on NutritionFacts.org is provided absolutely free of charge. There’s 
no special member area where you pay a fee to get extra lifesaving information. What 
membership websites seem to be saying, in essence, is that if you don’t give them 
money, they’ll withhold information that could make your family healthier. That’s 
unacceptable to me. Advances in health sciences should be freely available and 
accessible to all. 
Since we refuse to sell products, advertisements, or endorsements, how do the 
bills get paid? NutritionFacts.org is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that thrives on 
the Wikipedia model of simply accepting donations from visitors who appreciate the 
content. We reach so many millions of people that if even one in one thousand makes 
a small, tax-deductible contribution, we are able to pay for all the staff and server 
costs. (I personally don’t accept any compensation for my work on 
NutritionFacts.org; I’m privileged to be able to donate my time as a labor of love.) 
The hope is to offer a public service so valuable that viewers will feel moved to 
support it and keep this life-changing, life-saving resource free for everyone for all 
time. 
I welcome you to come and make NutritionFacts.org a part of your life. I’ve got 
new videos and articles every day on the latest in evidence-based nutrition. You can 
sign up for daily, weekly, or monthly e-mails highlighting all the new, fun, juicy 
information. It warms my heart to hear it’s become a Sunday ritual for many families. 
It exists to serve you. 
Taking Responsibility 
My goal is to give you the information to empower and inspire you to make healthy 
changes in your life, but in the end, it’s all up to you. Know, however, that there is 
only one way of eating that’s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the 
majority of patients, a diet centered around whole plant foods. Anytime anyone tries 
to sell you on some new diet, ask just one simple question: “Has it been proven to 
reverse heart disease?” (You know, the most likely cause of death for you and 
everyone you love?) If it hasn’t, why would you even consider it? 
If that’s all a whole-food, plant-based diet could do—reverse our number-one 
killer—then shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact 
that it can also be effective in preventing, treating, and arresting other leading killers 
would seem to make the case for eating this way overwhelming. Please give it a try. 
It could save your life.

How Not to Die may seem to you a strange title for a book. After all, everyone is 
going to die eventually. It’s about how not to die prematurely. If there is one 
takeaway message, it’s that you have tremendous power over your health destiny. The 
vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented with simple changes in what you 
eat and how you live. 
In other words, a long and healthy life is largely a matter of choice. In 2015, Dr. 
Kim Williams became president of the American College of Cardiology. He was 
asked why he chose to eat a strictly plant-based diet. “I don’t mind dying,” Dr. 
Williams said. “I just don’t want it to be my fault.”19 
That’s what this book is about: taking responsibility for your and your family’s 
health.

appreciation to Brenda and Vesanto for their keen insights and vast knowledge. 
This book would not have been possible without my wonderful staff—Joe, Katie, 
Liz, and Tommasina—and everyone at HSUS who supported me on the work front, 
and Andrea, my partner in life, and our beloved family, who supported me on the 
home front. NutritionFacts.org would not have even been possible without the Jesse 
& Julie Rasch Foundation, the design and coding genius of Christi Richards, and the 
thousands who have donated to enable my work to reach millions. 
Though it was my grandmother who made me the doctor I am today, it was my 
mother who made me the person I am today. I love you, Mom! 
 APPENDIX 
Supplements 
By getting your nutrients from green-light foods, not only will you minimize exposure 
to harmful food components, such as sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol, but you 
will maximize your intake of nearly every required nutrient: vitamin A carotenoids; 
vitamin C; vitamin E; the B vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, and folate; as 
well as magnesium, iron, and potassium, not to mention fiber.1 Dietary quality rating 
scales consistently rank the most-plant-based diets as the healthiest.2 
That said, because of the way we live in our modern world, there are important 
shortfalls that need to be corrected. 
For example, vitamin B12 is not made by plants; it’s made by microbes that 
blanket the earth. But in this sanitized modern world, we now chlorinate the water 
supply to kill off any bacteria. While you don’t get much B12 in the water anymore, 
you don’t get much cholera, either—that’s a good thing! Similarly, we evolved to 
make all the vitamin D we need from the sun, but most of us are no longer running 
around naked in equatorial Africa. You may be covered up, inside, at a high northern 
latitude and therefore need to supplement your diet with this “sunshine vitamin.” 
Thus, these two vitamins must be addressed. 
2,500 mcg (µg) Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) at Least Once a 
Week 
Given modern sanitary standards, a regular, reliable source of vitamin B12 is 
critical for anyone eating a plant-based diet.3 Though deficiency for those starting out 
with adequate stores may take years to develop,4 the results of B12 deficiency can be 
devastating, with cases reported of paralysis,5 psychosis,6 blindness,7 and even 
death.8 Newborn infants of mothers who eat a plant-based diet and who fail to 
supplement can develop deficiency much more rapidly with disastrous results.9 
For adults under age sixty-five, the easiest way to get B12 is to take at least one 
2,500 mcg supplement each week. If you take too much, you merely get expensive 
pee. Well, not all that expensive: A five-year supply of vitamin B12 can cost less 
than twenty dollars.10 If you’d rather get into the habit of taking it daily, the once-a- 
day dosing is 250 mcg.11 Note that these doses are specific to cyanocobalamin, the 
preferred supplemental form of vitamin B12, as there is insufficient evidence to 
support the efficacy of the other forms, like methylcobalamin.12 
As you age, your ability to absorb vitamin B12 may decline.13 For those over 
sixty-five who eat plant-based diets, the supplementation should probably be 
increased from at least 2,500 mcg a week (or 250 mcg a day) up to 1,000 mcg of 
cyanocobalamin each day.14,15 
Instead of taking B12 supplements, it’s possible to get sufficient amounts from 
B12-fortified foods, but you would have to eat three servings a day of foods 
providing at least 25 percent of the Daily Value (on the Nutrition Facts label),16 with 
each serving eaten at least four to six hours after the last.17 The only green-light 
source I’m aware of is B12-fortified nutritional yeast, for which two teaspoons three 
times a day would suffice. For most people, though, it would probably be cheaper 
and more convenient to just take a supplement. 
My other supplement recommendations in this section can be considered 
conditional, but getting enough vitamin B12 is absolutely nonnegotiable for those 
centering their diets around green-light foods. 
Vitamin D from Sun or Supplements 
I recommend that people unable to get sufficient sun take one 2,000 IU vitamin D3 
supplement each day,18 ideally with the largest meal of the day.19 
In the northern hemisphere, below approximately 30° latitude (south of Los 
Angeles, Dallas, or Atlanta), fifteen minutes each day of midday sun on the forearms 
and face without sunblock should produce sufficient vitamin D for Caucasians under 
the age of sixty. Those who have darker skin20 or who are older21 may require thirty 
minutes or more. 
Farther north, at 40° latitude (Portland, Chicago, or New York City), the sun’s 
rays are at such an angle during the months of November through February that 
vitamin D may not be produced. No matter how long you might sunbathe naked in 
Times Square on New Year’s Day, you won’t make any vitamin D.22 
Above 50° latitude (around London, Berlin, Moscow, and Edmonton, Canada), 
this “vitamin D winter” may extend for as long as six months of the year. 
Vitamin D supplements are therefore recommended for people at higher latitudes 
during the winter months and year-round for those not getting enough midday sun, 
regardless of location. This may also apply to those living in smoggy cities, such as 
Los Angeles or San Diego.23 
I do not recommend tanning beds. They can be both ineffective24 and dangerous.25 
The lamps emit mostly UVA, 26 which increases melanoma skin cancer risk without 
producing vitamin D.27 
Eat Iodine-Rich Foods 
Iodine, a mineral essential for thyroid function, is found predominantly in the ocean 
and in variable amounts in the soils of the world. To ensure everyone was getting 
enough, table salt was fortified with the mineral starting in the 1920s. So if you do 
add salt to your food, use iodized salt (not sea salt or “natural” salt, which contains 
about sixty times less iodine28). Given that sodium is considered the second-leading 
dietary killer in the world,29 however, iodized salt should be considered a red-light 
source. 
There are two yellow-light sources of iodine: seafood and dairy milk. (Iodine 
leaches into the milk from iodine-containing antiseptic chemicals used to disinfect the 
cow’s teats to prevent mastitis.30) The most concentrated green-light source is 
seaweed, which has the iodine of seafood without the fat-soluble pollutants that build 
up in the aquatic food chain. 
Sea vegetables are the underwater dark-green leafies. I encourage you to 
experiment with ways to include them in your diet. The recommended daily intake of 
iodine is 150 mcg, which is what is in about two sheets of nori,31 the seaweed that’s 
used to make sushi. There are all sorts of seaweed snacks on the market now, but 
most, if not all of them, seem to have added red-light ingredients. So I buy plain nori 
and season the sheets myself by brushing them with jarred pickled ginger juice and 
lightly sprinkling on wasabi powder before recrisping them at 300°F for about five 
minutes. 
Sprinkling just a half teaspoon of the seaweeds arame or dulse onto dishes you’re 
preparing may also get you your iodine for the day. Dulse is sold as pretty purple 
flakes you can just shake onto your food. I do caution against hijiki32 (also spelled 
hiziki), because it has been found to be contaminated with arsenic. I also caution 
against kelp, which may have too much iodine; just a half teaspoon of kelp could 
exceed the daily upper limit. For the same reason, you shouldn’t get into a regular 
habit of eating more than fifteen sheets of nori or more than a tablespoon of arame or 
dulse a day.33 Too much iodine can cause excessive thyroid gland activity.34 
For those who don’t like seaweed, Eden brand’s canned beans have a tiny amount 
of kelp added such that iodine levels average between 36.3 mcg per half-cup serving 
(great northern beans) to 71.2 mcg (navy beans).35 Not only are those levels safe— 
you’d have to eat about twenty cans a day to get too much—but checkmarking my 
three legume servings a day with Eden’s beans would fulfill your daily iodine 
requirement. 
One last note about iodine: Although people who avoid seafood and dairy 
products do not appear to have impaired thyroid function,36,37 I would not leave it to 
chance during pregnancy, where iodine is critical for proper brain development.38 I 
agree with the American Thyroid Association’s recommendation that all North 
American pregnant and breast-feeding women receive a prenatal vitamin containing 
150 mcg of iodine daily.39 
Consider Taking 250 mg of Pollutant-Free (Yeast- or Algae- 
Derived) Long-Chain Omega-3s Daily 
According to two of the most credible nutrition authorities, the World Health 
Organization and the European Food Safety Authority, you should get at least a half a 
percent of your calories from the short-chain omega-3 ALA.40 That’s easy—the one 
Daily Dozen tablespoon of ground flaxseeds takes care of that. Your body can then 
take the short-chain omega-3 from flaxseeds (or chia seeds or walnuts) and elongate 
it into the long-chain omega-3s EPA and DHA found in fish fat. The question, 
however, is whether the body can make enough for optimal brain health.41,42 Until we 
know more, I recommend taking 250 mg of pollutant-free long-chain omega-3s 
directly. 
I don’t recommend fish oil, since even purified (“distilled”) fish oil has been 
found to be contaminated with considerable amounts of PCBs and other pollutants, so 
much so that taken as directed, salmon, herring, and tuna oils would exceed the 
tolerable daily intake of toxicity.43 This may help explain the studies that found 
adverse effects of fish consumption on cognitive function in both adults and children. 
But many of those studies either were done downstream of a gold-mining area 
contaminated with mercury, which is used in the mining process,44 or included 
people who ate whale meat or fish caught next to chemical plants or toxic spills.45 
What about fish you’d just get at a restaurant or grocery store? 
An elite group of Floridians (mostly corporate executives) was studied. They ate 
so much seafood that at least 43 percent exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s safety limit for mercury, and it appeared to have an effect. The researchers 
found that excessive seafood intake, which they defined as more than around three to 
four servings per month of such fish as tuna or snapper, elevates mercury levels and 
appeared to cause cognitive dysfunction. The effect wasn’t large—only about a 5 
percent drop in cognitive performance—but “a decrement [in executive function] that 
no one, let alone a health-conscious and achievement-oriented person, is likely to 
welcome.”46 
Thankfully, you can get the benefits without the risks by getting long-chain omega- 
3s from algae instead,47 which is where the fish primarily get it from to begin with.48 
By cutting out the middle-fish and getting EPA and DHA directly from the source at 
the bottom of the food chain, you don’t have to worry about pollutant contamination. 
In fact, the algae used for supplements are just grown in tanks and never even come in 
contact with the ocean.49 That’s why I recommend a contaminant-free source to get 
the best of both worlds, omega-3 levels associated with brain preservation50 and 
minimized exposure to industrial pollutants. 
What About…? 
All the other vitamins, minerals, and nutrients should be taken care of by the 
mountains of nutrition you’ll be getting by centering your diet around whole plant 
foods. And many of those nutrients are ones Americans normally don’t get in 
sufficient quantity—namely, vitamins A, C, and E and the minerals magnesium and 
potassium, along with fiber.51 Ninety-three percent of Americans don’t get enough 
vitamin E. Ninety-seven percent of American adults don’t get enough fiber.52 Ninety- 
eight percent of American diets are deficient in potassium.53 You, my friend, are 
going to be the one in a thousand who does it right. 
If you have a specific question about some obscure nutrient—like, “What about 
my molybdenum or menaquinones?”—rather than have me bore everyone else with 
minutiae, allow me to refer you to the best reference book available on plant-based 
nutrition by the preeminent dietitians Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina.54 The 
authors go into great detail and even have chapters on pregnancy, breast-feeding, and 
raising bouncing boys and girls. 
Vitamin B12-fortified plant-based diets can offer health benefits for all stages of 
the life cycle.55 Dr. Benjamin Spock, the most esteemed pediatrician of all time, 
wrote perhaps the bestselling American book of the twentieth century: The Common 
Sense Book of Baby and Child Care. In the seventh edition, the final one before Dr. 
Spock died at ninety-four, he advocated children be raised on a plant-based diet with 
no exposure to meat or dairy products. Dr. Spock had lived long enough to see the 
beginnings of the childhood obesity epidemic. “Children who grow up getting their 
nutrition from plant foods,” he wrote, “have a tremendous health advantage and are 
much less likely to develop health problems as the years go by.”56
